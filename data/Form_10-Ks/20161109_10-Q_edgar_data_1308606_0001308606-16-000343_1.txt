Note 1. Organization  
  Company Organization and Operations 
  The Company operates as a self-administered and self-managed REIT that seeks to generate and deliver sustainable and attractive returns for stockholders by investing primarily in and managing a portfolio of single-tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the U.S. that is generally leased on a long-term, triple-net basis to tenants operating within predominantly retail, but also office and industrial property types. Single tenant, operationally essential real estate generally refers to free-standing, commercial real estate facilities where tenants conduct activities that are essential to the generation of their sales and profits. 
  The Company s operations are generally carried out through the Operating Partnership. OP Holdings, one of the Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner and owns   1.0%   of the Operating Partnership. The Corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary are the only limited partners and together own the remaining   99.0%   of the Operating Partnership. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our undepreciated investment in real estate and loans totaled approximately   $8.39 billion  , representing investments in   2,705   properties, including properties or other related assets securing mortgage loans made by the Company. Of this amount,   99.2%   consisted of our   $8.32 billion   investment in real estate, representing ownership of   2,630   properties, and the remaining   0.8%   consisted of   $69.2 million   in commercial mortgage and other loans receivable, primarily secured by the remaining   75   properties or other related assets.  
   
  Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
  Basis of Accounting and Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial statements include the normal, recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the information required to be set forth therein. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year. Certain information and note disclosures, normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, have been condensed or omitted from these statements pursuant to SEC rules and regulations and, accordingly, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s restated audited consolidated financial statements as filed with the SEC in its Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The Company has formed numerous special purpose entities to acquire and hold real estate encumbered by indebtedness (see Note 4). As a result, the majority of the Company s consolidated assets are held in these wholly-owned special purpose entities. Each special purpose entity is a separate legal entity and is the sole owner of its assets and responsible for its liabilities. The assets of these special purpose entities are not available to pay, or otherwise satisfy obligations to, the creditors of any affiliate or owner of another entity unless the special purpose entities have expressly agreed and are permitted under their governing documents. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , net assets totaling   $3.08 billion   and   $4.57 billion  , respectively, were held, and net liabilities totaling   $2.34 billion   and   $3.19 billion  , respectively, were owed by these special purpose entities and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although management believes its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates.

Segment Reporting 
  The Company views its operations as   one   segment, which consists of net leasing operations. The Company has no other reportable segments. 
  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
  The Company provided for reserves for uncollectible amounts related to its rent and other tenant receivables totaling   $14.7 million   and   $11.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, against accounts receivable balances of   $32.8 million   and   $26.3 million  , respectively. Receivables are recorded within deferred costs and other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  The Company established a reserve for losses of   $12.2 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , against deferred rental revenue receivables of   $79.8 million   and   $68.0 million  , respectively. Deferred rental revenue receivables are recorded within deferred costs and other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  Restricted Cash and Escrow Deposits 
  Restricted cash and deposits in escrow, classified within deferred costs and other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consisted of the following (in thousands): 

(1)      Funds held in reserve by lenders which can be applied at their discretion to the repayment of debt (any funds remaining on deposit after the debt is paid in full are released to the borrower). During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   $2.3 million   of lender reserves were surrendered to lenders in connection with the extinguishment of certain loans in default.  
   (2)      Deposits held as additional collateral support by lenders to fund tenant improvements, repairs and leasing commissions incurred to secure a new tenant.  
   (3)     Proceeds from the sale of assets pledged as collateral under the Spirit Master Funding Program, which are held on deposit until a qualifying substitution is made or the funds are applied as prepayment of principal.  
   (4)     Funds held in lender controlled accounts generally used to meet future debt service or certain property operating expenses. 
   (5)      Funds held in lender controlled accounts released after scheduled debt service requirements are met.  
  Goodwill 
  Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net fair value amounts that were assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.  Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value.  
  When the Company classifies a real estate asset that constitutes a business under GAAP as held for sale (typically real estate assets with an in-place lease), the proportionate amount of goodwill attributable to the real estate asset should be considered in determining the amount of impairment, if any. The portion of goodwill attributed is derived from the proportionate fair value of the real estate asset considered to be a business to the fair value of the Company s reporting unit.  
  When the Company disposes of a real estate asset that constitutes a business under GAAP (typically real estate assets with an in-place lease), a portion of goodwill is allocated to the carrying value of the real estate asset considered to  
  
   11 

SPIRIT REALTY CAPITAL, INC. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued) 
  September 30, 2016 
  (Unaudited) 

be a business to determine the gain/loss on the disposal. The portion of goodwill allocated is derived from the proportionate fair value of the business to the fair value of the Company s reporting unit.  
  Income Taxes 
  The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax provided it continues to satisfy certain tests concerning the Company s sources of income, the nature of its assets, the amounts distributed to its stockholders, and the ownership of Company stock. Management believes the Company has qualified and will continue to qualify as a REIT and therefore,   no   provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to state and local income and franchise taxes, and to federal income tax and excise tax on its undistributed income.  
  Franchise taxes are included in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through the Company s taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to federal, state, and local taxes, which are not material. 
  Restatement 
  The Company amended and restated its previously issued audited consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and the previously issued interim financial statements and other financial information contained in the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal periods ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015, March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The restatement resulted from the Company's accounting for goodwill subsequent to the Cole II Merger. Previously, the Company did not allocate goodwill to the disposal of real estate assets or held for sale real estate assets that met the definition of a business under GAAP, as required by ASC 350  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other  in order to determine gain on disposition of assets or impairments, if any, respectively. See the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 19, 2016 and the restated financial statements filed with the SEC on October 31, 2016 for additional details. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or the SEC that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless discussed below, these new accounting pronouncements entail technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance related to specialized industries or entities and therefore will have minimal, if any, impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations upon adoption. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which supersedes the existing guidance for lease accounting,   Leases (Topic 840)  . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize leases on their balance sheets, and leaves lessor accounting largely unchanged. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted for all entities. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to elect to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies many aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions under ASC Topic 718,   Compensation - Stock Compensation  , including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liability, forfeiture rate calculations and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which amends certain aspects of the guidance under ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606  . ASU 2016-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early application permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

  (Unaudited) 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  , which requires more timely recognition of credit losses associated with financial assets. ASU 2016-13 requires financial assets (or a group of financial assets) measured at an amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which addresses specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  
   
  Note 3. Investments 
  Real Estate Investments 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's gross investment in real estate properties and loans totaled approximately   $8.39 billion  , representing investments in   2,705   properties, including   75   properties or other related assets securing mortgage loans. The gross investment is comprised of land, buildings, lease intangible assets and lease intangible liabilities, as adjusted for any impairment, and the carrying amount of loans receivable, real estate assets held under direct financing leases and real estate assets held for sale. The portfolio is geographically dispersed throughout   49   states with only   one   state, Texas, with a real estate investment of   12.3%  , accounting for more than   10.0%   of the total dollar amount of the Company s real estate investment portfolio. 
    
  The properties that the Company owns are leased to tenants under long-term operating leases that typically include   one   or more renewal options. The leases are generally triple-net, which provides that the lessee is responsible for the payment of all property operating expenses, including property taxes, maintenance and repairs, and insurance costs. Therefore, the Company is generally not responsible for repairs or other capital expenditures related to its properties, unless the property is not subject to a triple-net lease agreement or becomes vacant. Generally, the Company's single-tenant leases contain contractual provisions increasing the rental revenue over the term of the lease at specified dates by: (1) a fixed amount or (2) increases in CPI over a specified period (typically subject to ceilings) or (b) a fixed percentage.  
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following real estate and loan activity, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization: 

(1)    Includes investments of   $5.4 million   in revenue producing capitalized expenditures, as well as   $2.9 million   of non-revenue producing capitalized maintenance expenditures. Capitalized maintenance expenditures are not included in the Company's investment in real estate disclosed elsewhere.  
   (2)    The total accumulated depreciation and amortization associated with dispositions of real estate was   $48.6 million  .  
   (3)     During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , pursuant to 1031 Exchanges, the Company sold   6   properties for   $43.7 million  . This amount, along with   $39.9 million   of 2015 proceeds, was used to partially fund   33   property acquisitions.  
   (4)     At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   43   and   36  , of the Company's properties, respectively, were vacant and in the Company s possession; of these vacant properties,   11   and   12  , respectively, were held for sale. 
   (5)    During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company transferred cash and mortgage notes receivable secured by   69   properties to acquire the fee simple interest of those properties. 
  Scheduled minimum future contractual rent to be received under the remaining non-cancelable term of the operating leases at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):  

Because lease renewal periods are exercisable at the option of the lessee, the preceding table presents future minimum lease payments due during the initial lease term only. In addition, the future minimum rentals do not include any contingent rentals based on a percentage of the lessees' gross sales or lease escalations based on future changes in the CPI or other stipulated reference rate. 
  Certain of the Company s leases contain purchase options. Most of these options are at or above fair market value at the time the option is exercisable, and none of these purchase options represent bargain purchase options.

Note 4. Debt 
  The Company's debt is summarized below: 

(1)    The effective interest rates include amortization of debt discount/premium, amortization of deferred financing costs and credit facility fees, where applicable, calculated for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and based on the average principal balance outstanding during the period. 
   (2)    Represents the weighted average stated interest rate based on the outstanding principal balance as of   September 30, 2016  . 
   (3)    Represents the weighted average maturity based on the outstanding principal balance as of   September 30, 2016  . 
   (4)    Variable-rate notes were predominantly hedged with interest rate swaps (see Note 5). 
   (5)    The Company records deferred financing costs for its 2015 Credit Facility in deferred costs and other assets, net on its consolidated balance sheets. 
  Revolving Credit Facilities 
  2015 Credit Facility  
  On March 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership entered into the Credit Agreement that established a new   $600.0 million   unsecured credit facility and terminated its secured   $400.0 million   2013 Credit Facility. The 2015 Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2019 (extendable at the Operating Partnership's option to March 31, 2020, subject to satisfaction of certain requirements) and includes an accordion feature to increase the committed facility size up to   $1.0 billion  , subject to satisfying certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments. On April 27, 2016, the Company expanded the borrowing capacity under the 2015 Credit Facility from   $600.0 million   to   $800.0 million   by partially exercising the accordion feature under the terms of the Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Facility also includes a   $50.0 million   sub-limit for swing-line loans and up to   $60.0 million   available for issuances of letters of credit. Swing-line loans and letters of credit reduce availability under the 2015 Credit Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis. On November 3, 2015, the Company entered into a first amendment to the Credit Agreement. The amendment conforms certain of the terms and covenants to those in the Term Loan Agreement, including limiting the requirement of subsidiary guarantees to material subsidiaries (as defined in the Credit Agreement) meeting certain conditions. At   September 30, 2016  , there were no subsidiaries meeting this requirement. 
  Borrowings bear interest at either a specified base rate or LIBOR plus an applicable margin, at the Operating Partnership's option. Per the amendment, the Operating Partnership s election to change the grid pricing from leverage based to credit rating based pricing initially requires at least two credit ratings of BBB- or better from S P or Fitch or Baa3 or better from Moody s. In April 2016, the Corporation received a first time rating of BBB- from Fitch and was upgraded to a BBB- corporate issuer rating by S P. As a result, the Operating Partnership elected to change the interest rate grid from leverage based pricing to credit rating based pricing in the second quarter of 2016. Under credit rating based pricing, the 2015 Credit Facility bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus   0.875%   to   1.55%   per annum or a specified base rate plus   0.0%   to   0.55%   and requires a facility fee in an amount equal to the aggregate revolving credit

commitments (whether or not utilized) multiplied by a rate equal to   0.125%   to   0.30%   per annum, in each case depending on the Corporation's credit rating. As of   September 30, 2016  , the 2015 Credit Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus   1.25%   based on the Company's credit rating and incurred a facility fee of   0.25%   per annum.  
  The Operating Partnership may voluntarily prepay the 2015 Credit Facility, in whole or in part, at any time, without premium or penalty, but subject to applicable LIBOR breakage fees, if any. Payment of the 2015 Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation and material subsidiaries that meet certain conditions (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The 2015 Credit Facility is full recourse to the Operating Partnership and the aforementioned guarantors.  
  As a result of entering into the 2015 Credit Facility and expanding the borrowing capacity, the Company incurred costs of   $4.8 million  . These deferred financing costs are being amortized to interest expense over the remaining initial term of the 2015 Credit Facility. The unamortized deferred financing costs relating to the 2015 Credit Facility were   $3.2 million   as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and recorded in deferred costs and other assets, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $105.0 million   was outstanding,   $0.3 million   of letters of credit were issued and   $694.7 million   of borrowing capacity was available under the 2015 Credit Facility. The Operating Partnership's ability to borrow under the 2015 Credit Facility is subject to ongoing compliance with a number of customary financial covenants and other customary affirmative and negative covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with these financial covenants.  
  2013 Credit Facility  
  On March 31, 2015, the secured 2013 Credit Facility was terminated and its outstanding borrowings were repaid with proceeds from the 2015 Credit Facility. Properties securing this facility became unencumbered upon its termination. The 2013 Credit Facility's borrowing margin was LIBOR plus   2.50%   based on the Company's leverage, with an unused fee of   0.35%  . Upon terminating the 2013 Credit Facility, the Company recognized debt extinguishment costs of   $2.0 million  , resulting from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. 
  Line of Credit 
  A special purpose entity indirectly owned by the Corporation had access to a   $40.0 million   secured revolving line of credit, which expired on March 27, 2016.  
  Term Loan 
  On November 3, 2015, the Company entered into a Term Loan Agreement among the Operating Partnership, as borrower, the Company as guarantor and the lenders that are parties thereto. The Term Loan Agreement provides for a   $325.0 million   senior unsecured term facility that has an initial maturity date of November 2, 2018, which may be extended at the Company's option pursuant to   two   one-year extension options, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of an extension fee. In addition, an accordion feature allows the facility to be increased up to   $600.0 million  , subject to obtaining additional lender commitments. During the fourth quarter of 2015, upon obtaining additional lender commitments, the Company increased the term facility from   $325.0 million   to   $370.0 million  .  
  The Term Loan Agreement provides that borrowings bear interest at either LIBOR plus   1.35%   to   1.80%   per annum or a specified base rate plus   0.35%   to   0.80%   per annum, at the Operating Partnership's option. In each case, the applicable margin is determined based upon the Corporation s leverage ratio. If the Corporation obtains at least two credit ratings on its senior unsecured long-term indebtedness of BBB- from S P or Fitch or Baa3 from Moody's, the Operating Partnership may make an irrevocable election to have the margin based upon the Corporation's credit ratings. In April 2016, the Corporation received a first time rating of BBB- from Fitch and was upgraded to a BBB- corporate issuer rating by S P. As a result, the Operating Partnership elected to change the interest rate grid from leverage based pricing to credit rating based pricing in the second quarter of 2016. Under credit rating based pricing, borrowings bear interest at either LIBOR plus   0.90%   to   1.75%   per annum or a specified base rate plus   0.0%   to   0.75%   per annum, in each case depending on the Corporation s credit ratings. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR plus   1.35%   based on the Company's credit rating.

The Operating Partnership may voluntarily prepay the Term Loan, in whole or in part, at any time, without premium or penalty, but subject to applicable LIBOR breakage fees. Borrowings may be repaid without premium or penalty, and may be re-borrowed within   30   days up to the then available loan commitment and subject to occurrence limitations within any   twelve  -month period. Payment of the Term Loan is unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation and, under certain circumstances, by one or more material subsidiaries (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) of the Corporation. The obligations of the Corporation and any guarantor under the Term Loan are full recourse to the Corporation and each guarantor. 
  As a result of entering into the Term Loan, the Company incurred origination costs of   $2.3 million  . These deferred financing costs are being amortized to interest expense over the remaining initial term of the Term Loan. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the unamortized deferred financing costs relating to the Term Loan were   $1.6 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively, and recorded net against the principal balance of the Term Loan on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Term Loan was fully drawn. The Operating Partnership's ability to borrow under the Term Loan is subject to ongoing compliance with a number of customary financial covenants and other customary affirmative and negative covenants. The Corporation has unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of the Operating Partnership under the Term Loan Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with these financial covenants. 
  Senior Unsecured Notes 
  On August 18, 2016, the Operating Partnership completed a private placement of   $300.0 million   aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which are guaranteed by the Corporation. The Senior Unsecured Notes were issued at   99.378%   of their principal amount, resulting in net proceeds of   $296.2 million  , after deducting transaction fees and expenses. The Senior Unsecured Notes accrue interest at a rate of   4.450%   per year, payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, until the maturity date of September 15, 2026. The Company has agreed to file with the SEC and cause to become effective a registration statement pursuant to which the Company will offer to exchange the Senior Unsecured Notes for substantially similar registered notes.  
  The Senior Unsecured Notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Operating Partnership s option, at a redemption price equal to the sum of: an amount equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, up to, but not including, the redemption date; and a make-whole premium calculated in accordance with the indenture.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any of the Senior Unsecured Notes are redeemed on or after June 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Senior Unsecured Notes), the redemption price will not include a make-whole premium.       
  In connection with the offering, the Operating Partnership incurred   $3.0 million   in deferred financing costs. This amount is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the Senior Unsecured Notes. As of September 30, 2016, the unamortized deferred financing costs relating to the Senior Unsecured Notes were   $2.9 million   and recorded net against the Senior Unsecured Notes principal balance on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with these financial covenants. 
  Master Trust Notes  
  The Company has access to an asset-backed securitization platform, the Spirit Master Funding Program, to raise capital through the issuance of non-recourse net-lease mortgage notes collateralized by commercial real estate, net-leases and mortgage loans. The Spirit Master Funding Program consists of two separate securitization trusts, Master Trust 2013 and Master Trust 2014, each of which have one or multiple bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entities as issuers or co-issuers of the notes.

The 2019 Notes will mature on   May 15, 2019   and the 2021 Notes will mature on   May 15, 2021  . 
  The Convertible Notes are convertible only during certain periods and, subject to certain circumstances, into cash, shares of the Corporation's common stock, or a combination thereof. The initial conversion rate applicable to each series is   76.3636   per   $1,000   principal note (equivalent to an initial conversion price of   $13.10   per share of common stock, representing a   22.5%   premium above the public offering price of the common stock offered concurrently at the time the Convertible Notes were issued). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment for certain anti-dilution events, including special distributions and regular quarterly cash dividends exceeding   $0.16625   per share. As of   September 30, 2016  , the conversion rate was   76.7079   per   $1,000   principal note.

  In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company recorded a discount of   $56.7 million  , which represents the estimated value of the embedded conversion feature for each of the Convertible Notes. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of each of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes.

As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a net gain on debt extinguishment of approximately   $2.5 million  . The gain was primarily attributable to the write-off of net debt premiums and the reduction of   $17.5 million   of debt using net sale proceeds of   $14.0 million   from the sale of   four   properties securing a portion of a defaulted CMBS loan, partially offset by defeasance fees.

  Note 5. Derivative and Hedging Activities  
  The Company uses interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt. These derivatives are considered cash flow hedges and are recorded on a gross basis at fair value. Assessments of hedge effectiveness are performed quarterly using regression analysis and the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness is based on the hypothetical derivative method. The effective portion of changes in fair value are recorded in AOCL and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion is recorded immediately in earnings in general and administrative expenses.  
  The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company evaluates counterparty credit risk through monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties, which includes review of debt ratings and financial performance. To mitigate its credit risk, the Company enters into agreements with counterparties it considers credit-worthy, such as large financial institutions with favorable credit ratings.

Approximately   $8 thousand   of the remaining balance in AOCL is estimated to be reclassified as an increase to interest expense during the next twelve months. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes.  
   
  Note 6. Stockholders  Equity  
  Issuance of Common Stock 
  On April 15, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of   34.5 million   shares of its common stock, at   $11.15   per share, including   4.5 million   shares sold pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, for gross proceeds of approximately   $384.7 million  . Net proceeds were approximately   $368.9 million   after deducting underwriter discounts and offering costs paid by the Company. The net proceeds were initially used to reduce amounts outstanding under the Term Loan.  
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , portions of awards of restricted common stock and performance share awards granted to certain of the Company's officers and other employees vested. The vesting of these awards, granted pursuant to the Amended Incentive Award Plan, resulted in federal and state income tax liabilities for the recipients. As permitted by the terms of the Amended Incentive Award Plan and the award grants, certain executive officers and employees elected to surrender   0.2 million   shares of common stock valued at   $0.7 million  , solely to pay the associated minimum statutory tax withholdings during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The Company records its repurchased shares of common stock using the cost method. Shares repurchased are considered retired under Maryland law and the cost of the stock repurchased is recorded as a reduction to common stock and accumulated deficit on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  ATM Program  
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Corporation sold   6.3 million   shares of its common stock under its ATM Program, at a weighted average share price of   $12.47  , for aggregate gross proceeds of   $79.0 million   and aggregate net proceeds of   $77.7 million   after payment of commissions and other issuance costs of   $1.3 million  . The net proceeds were used to fund acquisitions, repay borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities and for general corporate purposes. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $24.5 million   in gross proceeds capacity remained available under the ATM Program. 
  Stock Repurchase Program 
  In February 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, which authorizes the Company to purchase up to   $200 million   of its common stock in the open market or through private transactions from time to time over the next   18   months. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at the Company's discretion. The Company intends to fund any repurchases with the net proceeds from asset sales, cash flows from operations, existing cash on the balance sheet and other sources. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   no   stock was repurchased under the stock repurchase program. 
  Dividends Declared 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Corporation's Board of Directors declared the following dividends: 

The dividend declared on September 15, 2016 was paid on October 14, 2016 and is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities as of   September 30, 2016  .

Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies  
  The Company is periodically subject to claims or litigation in the ordinary course of business, including claims generated from business conducted by tenants on real estate owned by the Company. In these instances, the Company is typically indemnified by the tenant against any losses that might be suffered, and the Company and/or the tenant are typically insured against such claims. 
    
  On September 8, 2015, Haggen Holdings, LLC and a number of its affiliates, including Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC, (collectively, the "Debtors") filed petitions for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. At the time of the filing, Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC leased   20   properties on a triple net basis from a subsidiary of the Company under a master lease with initial monthly rents of   $1.4 million   and an initial lease expiration date of February 28, 2035. Haggen Holdings, LLC is the guarantor of the tenant s obligations under that master lease. A subsidiary of the Company and the Debtors entered into a settlement agreement whereby the subsidiary consented to the partial assumption and partial rejection of the master lease permitting (a) the assumption of   nine   stores subject to the lease and their assignment to   three   unaffiliated grocery operators with winning bids in an auction of the respective leaseholds, (b) the rejection of the leasehold with respect to   six   of the stores and their return to the Company's possession, and (c) the assumption and continued operation by the tenant of   five   of the stores. Under the settlement agreement, the subsidiary of the Company received an unsecured stipulated damages claim for   $21.0 million   against each of Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC and Haggen Holdings, LLC, as well as certain agreed upon fees, expenses and cure payments in the bankruptcy. The court approved the settlement agreement in an order entered November 25, 2015. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016  , the bankruptcy court approved a settlement agreement, by and between our subsidiary, the Debtors and Albertson s LLC, which provides for (a) the partial assignment of the existing Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC master lease to Albertson s LLC with respect to   four   of the   five   properties under the master lease, (b) the rejection of the leasehold with respect to the   one   store not included in the master lease assignment, (c) the execution of a new lease or leases between the subsidiary of the Company and Albertson s LLC with respect to the   four   assigned stores, including a   $0.35 million   annual rent reduction for   one   store, and (d) the reimbursement of certain of the Company's fees, expenses and cure amounts solely with respect to the assigned stores. In return for the rent concession, Albertson s LLC paid the Company   $3.0 million   upon execution of the amended leases and the Debtors have agreed to grant the Company an allowed administrative claim of   $0.8 million  . The   $3.0 million   payment has been recorded to other liabilities on the balance sheet and will be amortized to rent over the remaining lease term. In return for the rejected store, the Company has been granted an incremental allowed unsecured claim of   $2.6 million  , of which   $1.8 million   is entitled to administrative priority, against each of Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC and Haggen Holdings, LLC.  
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company collected and recognized   $2.5 million   of the   $21.0 million   original stipulated damages claim following the property assignments to Albertsons's LLC, and the remaining amounts will be recognized when collected. The amount of the settlement claim was negotiated based on lost rent relating to rejected properties and below market rents on properties assigned to new operators through bankruptcy.  As a result, a portion of the collections are recorded in interest income and other in the income statement, and the remainder is recorded in other liabilities on the balance sheet and amortized to rent over the remaining lease term. Of the   $2.5 million   noted above,   $1.8 million   was recognized as lease termination income with the remainder recorded on the balance sheet. As of   September 30, 2016  , the bankruptcy proceeding remains ongoing and there is no guaranty that the remaining claims will be paid or otherwise satisfied in full.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   outstanding claims against the Company that are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had commitments totaling   $58.0 million  , of which   $24.7 million   relates to future acquisitions with the remainder to fund improvements on properties the Company currently owns. Commitments related to acquisitions contain standard cancellation clauses contingent on the results of due diligence. Of the total commitments of   $58.0 million  ,   $43.6 million   is expected to be funded during fiscal year   2016  . In addition, the Company is contingently liable for   $5.7 million   of debt owed by   one   of its tenants and is indemnified by that tenant for any payments the Company may be required to make on such debt.

The Company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. The Company considers various factors when estimating its environmental liabilities, and adjustments are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues. When only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than another, the low end of the range is recorded in the consolidated financial statements.  

Note 8. Fair Value Measurements  
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company s assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are summarized below. The following table sets forth the Company s financial liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands): 

The interest rate swaps are measured using a market approach, using prices obtained from a nationally recognized pricing service and pricing models with market observable inputs such as interest rates and volatilities. These measurements are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value measurement of an asset on a nonrecurring basis occurs when events or changes in circumstances related to an asset indicate that the carrying amount of the asset is no longer recoverable. The following table sets forth the Company s assets that were accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (in thousands):  

(1)      Impairment charges are presented for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The fair values of impaired real estate and intangible assets were determined by using the following information, depending on availability, in order of preference: signed purchase and sale agreements or letters of intent; judicial foreclosure price; sales prices for comparable properties; estimates of cash flow, which consider, among other things, contractual and forecasted rental revenues, leasing assumptions, and expenses based upon market conditions; and expectations for the use of the real estate. Based on these inputs, the Company determined that its valuation of the impaired real estate and intangible assets falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , we determined that   seven   and   eighteen   long-lived assets held and used, respectively, were impaired. The Company estimated the fair value of these properties using weighted average sales price per square foot of comparable properties for all of the impaired properties during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and for   thirteen   of the   eighteen   impaired properties during the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  Financial assets and liabilities for which the carrying values approximate their fair values include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and escrow deposits, and accounts receivable and payable. Generally, these assets and liabilities are short-term in duration and are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  In addition to the disclosures for assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value at the balance sheet date, companies are required to disclose the estimated fair values of all financial instruments, even if they are not carried at their fair values. The fair values of financial instruments are estimates based upon market conditions and perceived risks at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . These estimates require management s judgment and may not be indicative of the future fair values of the assets and liabilities. 
  The estimated fair value of the loans receivable is determined using future cash flows discounted at current replacement rates for these instruments. Cash flows are determined using contractual loan payments. The current replacement rates are determined by using yield curves calculated by aggregating comparably rated USD denominated U.S. corporate debt or the index to which these financial instruments are tied. The Revolving Credit Facilities, Term Loan, Senior Unsecured Notes, mortgages and notes payable and Convertible Notes were measured using future cash flows discounted at current replacement rates for these instruments. Cash flows are determined using a forward interest rate yield curve. The current replacement rates are determined by using the U.S. Treasury yield curve or the index to which these financial instruments are tied, and adjusted for the credit spreads. Credit spreads take into consideration general market conditions, maturity and collateral. These measurements are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table discloses fair value information for these financial instruments (in thousands):    

(1)      The carrying value of the debt instruments are net of unamortized deferred financing costs and certain debt discounts/premiums.

Note 9. Significant Credit and Revenue Concentration 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s real estate investments are operated by   452   and   438   tenants, respectively, that operate within retail, office and industrial property types across various industries throughout the U.S. Shopko operates in the general merchandise industry and is the Company s largest tenant as a percentage of Normalized Revenue. Total rental revenues from properties leased to Shopko for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , contributed   8.0%   and   9.9%   of the Company's Normalized Revenue from continuing operations, respectively.   No   other tenant contributed   4%   or more of the Company s Normalized Revenue during any of the periods presented. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company's net investment in Shopko properties represents approximately   6.1%   and   6.9%  , respectively, of the Company s total assets and the Company's real estate investment in Shopko represents approximately   8.0%   and   9.0%  , respectively, of the Company's total real estate investment portfolio. 
   
  Note 10. Supplemental Cash Flow Information 
  The following table presents the supplemental cash flow disclosures (in thousands): 

(1)     Accrued and overdue interest on certain CMBS notes that have been intentionally placed in default. 

Note 11. Incentive Award Plan 
  On May 11, 2016, the stockholders of the Company approved the Amended Incentive Award Plan, which increased the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance thereunder by   5.5 million   shares. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   5.7 million   shares remained available for award under the Amended Incentive Award Plan.  
  Restricted Shares of Common Stock 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   0.9 million   restricted shares under the Amended Incentive Award Plan to certain executive officers and employees. The Company recorded   $11.7 million   in deferred compensation associated with these grants, which will be recognized in expense over the service period of the awards. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   1.0 million   unvested restricted shares outstanding.  
  Performance Share Awards 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Board of Directors or committee thereof approved an initial target grant of   0.3 million   performance shares, net of forfeitures of   0.1 million  , to executive officers of the Company. The performance period of this grant runs from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018. Potential shares of the Corporation's common stock that each participant is eligible to receive is based on the initial target number of shares granted multiplied by a percentage range between   0%   and   250%  . Grant date fair value was calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which incorporated stock price correlation, projected dividend yields and other variables over the time horizons matching the performance periods. Stock-based compensation expense associated with unvested performance share awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum required service period, which is generally three years. Based on the grant date fair value, the Corporation expects to recognize   $4.1 million   in compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period associated with this market-based grant.  
  Approximately   $0.4 million   and   $0.2 million   in dividend rights have been accrued for non-vested performance share awards outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. For outstanding non-vested awards at   September 30, 2016  ,   0.8 million   shares would have been released based on the Corporation's TSR relative to the specified peer groups through that date. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   0.2 million   shares were released at target in connection with qualifying terminations of participants.

Note 12. Income Per Share 
  Income   per share has been computed using the two-class method.   Income   per common share under the two-class method is computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both shares of common stock and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Classification of the Company's unvested restricted stock, which contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends, are deemed participating securities under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, earnings attributable to unvested restricted shares are deducted from   income   from continuing operations in the computation of net   income   attributable to common stockholders. The table below is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted net   income   per share computed using the two-class method (dollars in thousands):

The Corporation intends to satisfy its exchange obligation for the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to the note holders entirely in cash, therefore, the "if-converted" method does not apply and the treasury stock method is being used. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation's average stock price was above the conversion price, resulting in   972,054   potentially dilutive shares related to the conversion spread. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation's average stock price was below the conversion price, resulting in   zero   potentially dilutive shares related to the conversion spread.  
   
  Note 13. Costs Associated With Restructuring Activities 
  On November 16, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors approved the strategic decision to relocate its headquarters from Scottsdale, Arizona to Dallas, Texas. The Company began occupying temporary office space in the new headquarters building in the spring of 2016, and finalized the move with the opening of the new office space in late September 2016. As a result of moving its corporate headquarters, the Company is incurring various restructuring charges, including employee separation and relocation costs. Restructuring charges incurred for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   totaled   $3.3 million   and   $5.7 million  , respectively, and are included within restructuring charges on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Restructuring charges for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were reduced for   $0.2 million   of straight-line rent payable that was previously recognized for the Company's Scottsdale headquarters in association with lease termination. To date, the Company has incurred restructuring charges totaling   $12.8 million  . 
  The following table presents a reconciliation of the liability attributable to restructuring charges incurred as of   September 30, 2016  , which is recorded within accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):

Overview 
  Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. is a New York Stock Exchange listed company under the ticker symbol "SRC". We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT with in-house capabilities including acquisition, portfolio management, asset management, credit research, real estate research, legal, finance and accounting and capital markets. We primarily invest in single-tenant, operationally essential real estate assets throughout the U.S., which are generally acquired through strategic sale-leaseback transactions and subsequently leased on long-term, triple-net basis to high-quality tenants with business operations within predominantly retail, but also office and industrial property types. Single tenant, operationally essential real estate consists of properties that are generally free-standing, commercial real estate facilities where our tenants conduct activities that are essential to the generation of their sales and profits. In support of our primary business of owning and leasing real estate, we have also strategically originated or acquired long-term, commercial mortgage and other loans to provide a range of financing solutions to our tenants. 
  We generate our revenue primarily by leasing our properties to our tenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , our undepreciated investment in real estate and loans totaled approximately   $8.39 billion  , representing investments in   2,705   properties, including properties and other assets securing our mortgage loans. Of this amount,   99.2%   consisted of investment in real estate, representing ownership of   2,630   properties, and the remaining   0.8%   consisted of commercial mortgage and other loans receivable primarily secured by the remaining   75   real properties or other related assets.  
  Our operations are primarily carried out through the Operating Partnership. OP Holdings, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner and owns   1.0%   of the Operating Partnership. We and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the only limited partners, and together own the remaining   99.0%   of the Operating Partnership. Although the Operating Partnership is wholly-owned by us, in the future, we may issue partnership interests in the Operating Partnership to third parties in exchange for property owned by such third parties. In general, any partnership interests in the Operating Partnership issued to third parties would be exchangeable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock at specified ratios set when such partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are issued.  
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2005. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our owned properties were approximately   98.4%   occupied (based on number of properties), and our leases had a weighted average non-cancelable remaining lease term (based on total rental revenue) of approximately   10.5   years. Our leases are generally originated with long lease terms, typically non-cancelable initial terms of 15 to 20 years with tenant renewal options for additional years. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   89%   of our single-tenant properties (based on Normalized Rental Revenue) provided for increases in future annual base contractual rent.

  Factors that May Influence Our Operating Results  
  Acquisitions 
  Our principal line of business is acquiring commercial real estate properties and leasing these properties to our tenants. Our ability to grow revenue and produce superior risk adjusted returns will principally depend on our ability to acquire additional properties that meet our investment criteria at a yield sufficiently in excess of our cost of capital. We primarily focus on opportunities to acquire attractive commercial real estate by providing capital to small and middle-market companies that we conclude have stable and proven operating histories and attractive credit characteristics, but lack the access to capital that large companies often have. Small and middle-market companies are often willing to enter into leases with structures and terms that we consider appealing (such as master leases and leases that require ongoing tenant financial reporting) and that we believe increase the security of rental payments. 
  Operationally Essential Real Estate with Long-Term Leases 
  We seek to own properties that are operationally essential to our tenants, thereby reducing the risk that our tenants would choose not to renew an expiring lease or reject a lease in bankruptcy. In addition, we seek to enter into leases with relatively long terms, typically with initial terms of 15 to 20 years and tenant renewal options for additional terms with attractive rent escalation provisions. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our leases had a weighted average remaining lease term (based on rental revenue) of approximately   10.5   years.  
  Portfolio Diversification 
  Our strategy emphasizes a portfolio that (1) derives no more than 10% of its annual rent from any single tenant and no more than 1.0% of its annual rent from any single property, (2) is leased to tenants operating in various industries and (3) is located across the U.S. without significant geographic concentration.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Shopko represents our most significant tenant at   8.0%   of Normalized Revenue. Following the 2014 restructuring of the Shopko master lease and defeasance of the related secured indebtedness, we have continued our objective to reduce the tenant concentration of Shopko. During the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   19   Shopko properties having an investment value of   $118.4 million  . These sales, coupled with our increased rental revenue from real estate investments of   $627.8 million   acquired during the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , have reduced our current Shopko tenant concentration to   8.0%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   9.9%   for the same period in   2015  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , 84 Properties, LLC, with a   2.8%   tenant concentration, was our second most significant tenant. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   108   properties under a master lease. The master lease was subject to senior mortgage debt, which was repaid during the three months ended June 30, 2016. The master lease agreement included a purchase option, which upon 180 days prior written notice, 84 Properties, LLC could elect to purchase all  
  
   35 

of the properties from us prior to the end of the 10th, 15th and 20th years of the lease. On October 5, 2016, an amendment  to the master lease agreement was executed allowing 84 Properties, LLC to accelerate the exercise of the first purchase option date. On   October 26, 2016  , we completed the sale of all   108   properties to 84 Properties, LLC for total cash consideration of   $205.7 million  .  
  We believe that our experience, in-depth market knowledge and extensive network of long-standing relationships in the real estate industry will continue to provide us access to an ongoing pipeline of attractive acquisitions. However, because we primarily use external financing to fund acquisitions, periods of volatility in the credit and capital markets that may negatively affect the amounts, sources and cost of capital available to us could force us to limit our acquisition activity. Additionally, to the extent that we access capital at a higher cost (reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or lower stock price for equity financing), our financial results could be adversely affected.    
  Our Leases 
  Rent Escalators    
  Generally, our single-tenant leases contain contractual provisions increasing the rental revenue over the term of the lease at specified dates by: (1) a fixed amount or (2) the lesser of (a) 1 to 1.25 times any increase in CPI over a specified period or (b) a fixed percentage, typically 1% to 2% per year. The percentage of our single-tenant properties (based on Normalized Rental Revenue) containing rent escalators remained consistent at approximately   89%   as of both   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 
  Master Lease Structure  
  Where appropriate, we seek to enter into master leases, pursuant to which we lease multiple properties to a single tenant on an  all or none  basis. We seek to use the master lease structure to prevent a tenant from unilaterally giving up under-performing properties while retaining well-performing properties. Master lease revenue contributed approximately   46%   and   45%   of our Normalized Rental Revenue as of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
  Triple-Net Leases  
  Our leases are predominantly triple-net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums and repair and maintenance costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   84.0%   of our single-tenant properties (based on Normalized Rental Revenue) are subject to triple-net leases compared to approximately   85.9%   as of   September 30, 2015  .  
  Asset Management 
  The stability of the rental revenue generated by our properties depends principally on our and our tenants  ability to 1) pay rent and our ability to collect rent due, 2) renew expiring leases or re-lease space upon expiration or other termination, 3) lease currently vacant properties, and 4) maintain or increase rental rates. Each of these could be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions, particularly those that affect the markets in which our properties are located, downturns in our tenants  industries, increased competition for our tenants at our property locations, or the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants. We seek to manage these risks by using our developed underwriting and risk management processes to structure and manage our portfolio.  
  On September 8, 2015, Haggen Holdings, LLC and a number of its affiliates, including Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC, (collectively, the "Debtors") filed petitions for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. At the time of the filing, Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC leased 20 properties on a triple net basis from a subsidiary of ours under a master lease with initial monthly rents of $1.4 million and an initial lease expiration date of February 28, 2035. Haggen Holdings, LLC is the guarantor of the tenant s obligations under that master lease. Our subsidiary and the Debtors entered into a settlement agreement whereby our subsidiary consented to the partial assumption and partial rejection of the master lease permitting (a) the assumption of nine stores subject to the lease and their assignment to three unaffiliated grocery operators with winning bids in an auction of the respective leaseholds, (b) the rejection of the leasehold with respect to six of the stores and their return to our possession, and (c) the assumption and continued operation by the tenant of five of the stores. Under the settlement agreement, our subsidiary received an unsecured stipulated damages claim for $21.0 million against each of Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC and Haggen Holdings, LLC, as well as certain agreed upon fees, expenses and cure payments in the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement in an order entered November 25, 2015.  
  
   36 

During the second quarter of 2016, the bankruptcy court approved a settlement agreement, by and between our subsidiary, the Debtors and Albertson s LLC, which provides for (a) the partial assignment of the existing Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC master lease to Albertson s LLC with respect to four of the five properties under the master lease, (b) the rejection of the leasehold with respect to the one store not included in the master lease assignment, (c) the execution of a new lease or leases between our subsidiary and Albertson s LLC with respect to the four assigned stores, including a $0.35 million annual rent reduction for one store, and (d) the reimbursement of certain of our fees, expenses and cure amounts solely with respect to the assigned stores. In return for the rent concession, Albertson s LLC paid us $3.0 million upon execution of the amended lease or leases and the Debtors have agreed to grant us an allowed administrative claim of $0.8 million. In return for the rejected store, we have been granted an incremental allowed unsecured claim of $2.6 million, of which $1.8 million is entitled to administrative priority, against each of Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC and Haggen Holdings, LLC.  
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we sold three of the seven rejected stores for $20.8 million, with the remaining four rejected stores being marketed for sale or lease. In June 2016, we collected $2.5 million of the $21.0 million original stipulated damages claim. We anticipate collecting the balance of each of the aforementioned claims within the next several quarters, although the bankruptcy proceeding remains ongoing, and there is no guaranty that the remaining claims will be paid or otherwise satisfied in full.  
  Active Management and Monitoring of Risks Related to Our Investments 
  We seek to measure tenant financial distress risk and lease renewal risk through various processes. Many of our tenants are required to provide corporate-level and/or unit-level financial information, which includes balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement data on a quarterly and/or annual basis. Our underwriting and risk management processes are designed to structure new investments and manage existing investments to mitigate tenant credit quality risks and preserve the long-term return on our invested capital. Since our inception, our occupancy has never been below 96.1% (based on number of properties). As of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the percentage of our properties that were occupied was   98.4%   and   98.5%  , respectively.  
  Capital Recycling  
  We continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties in our portfolio when we believe such disposition is appropriate in view of our business objectives, considering criteria including, but not limited to, tenant concentration, tenant credit quality, unit financial performance, local market conditions and lease rates, associated indebtedness, asset location and tenant operation type (e.g., industry, sector, or concept/brand), as well as potential uses of proceeds and tax considerations. As part of this strategy, we attempt at times to enter into 1031 Exchanges, when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the dispositions, if any, for federal and state income tax purposes. 
  The timing of any potential dispositions will depend on market conditions and other factors, including but not limited to, our capital needs and ability to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales. We can provide no assurance that we will dispose of any additional properties or that future acquisitions and/or dispositions, if any, will qualify as 1031 Exchanges. Furthermore, we can provide no assurance that we will deploy the proceeds from future dispositions in a manner that produces comparable or better yields.  
  Capital Funding 
  Our principal demands for funds are for property acquisitions, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, operating and property maintenance expenses and distributions to our stockholders. Generally, cash needs for payments of principal and interest, operating and property maintenance expenses and distributions to stockholders will be generated from cash flows from operations, which are primarily driven by the rental income received from our leased properties, interest income earned on loans receivable and interest income on our cash balances. We generally temporarily fund the acquisition of real estate utilizing our Revolving Credit Facilities or Term Loan, followed by permanent financing through asset level financing or by issuing debt or equity securities. 
  Interest Costs 
  Our fixed-rate debt structure provides us with a stable and predictable cash requirement related to our debt service. Any changes to our debt structure, including borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility, Term Loan or debt financing associated with property acquisitions, could materially influence our operating results depending on the terms of any such indebtedness. A significant amount of our debt provides for scheduled principal payments. As principal is repaid,  
  
   37 

our interest expense decreases. Changing interest rates will increase or decrease the interest expense we incur on unhedged variable interest rate debt and may impact our ability to refinance maturing debt.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. From time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended   December 31, 2015   in the section entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  We have not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this quarterly report.

Results of Operations 
  Comparison of Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015 
  The following discussion includes the results of our continuing operations as summarized in the table below:  

NM - Percentages over 100% are not displayed. 
  Revenues 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , approximately   94.2%   of our total revenue was attributable to long-term leases. The year-over-year   increase   of   2.4%   in total revenue was due primarily to an increase in base rental revenue resulting from real estate acquisitions subsequent to   September 30, 2015  , as well as recognition of other non-tenant income recorded in other income and interest from real estate transactions.  
  Rentals 
  The   increase   in rental revenue for the comparative period was primarily attributable to the acquisition of   261   properties representing an investment in real estate of   $627.8 million   during the twelve-month period ended   September 30, 2016  . This   increase   was partially offset by the sale of   120   properties during the same period having an investment value of   $393.8 million  . Non-cash rentals for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $6.7 million   and   $6.0  
  
   39 

million  , respectively. These amounts represent approximately   4.2%   and   3.8%   of total rental revenue from continuing operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   98.4%   of our owned properties were occupied (based on number of properties). The majority of our nonperforming properties were in the convenience stores and restaurants-casual dining industries. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively,   43   and   37   of our properties, representing approximately   1.6%   and   1.5%   of our owned properties, were vacant and not generating rent. Of the   43   vacant properties,   11   were held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Interest income on loans receivable 
  The decrease in interest income on loans receivable is a result of a decrease in financed properties from   145   at   September 30, 2015   to   75   financed properties at   September 30, 2016  , resulting in a decrease in mortgage loans receivable balances for the comparative period of   36.7%  . 
  Other income and interest from real estate transactions 
  The year-over-year increase was due primarily to $2.6 million in fee income associated with the prepayment of certain mortgage loans receivable and $2.3 million in lease termination income, offset by lease termination income of $2.2 million recognized during the comparable prior period.  
  Expenses  
  General and administrative 
  The year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to $2.0 million of bad debt expense recorded in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   in relation to four convenience store properties for which the rent has been determined to be uncollectible. Additionally, there is an increase in professional fees and office expenses of $0.7 million for the comparable periods. Higher professional fees include legal, consulting and temporary services attributable to our relocation to Dallas.  
  Restructuring charges 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, we made the strategic decision to relocate our headquarters from Scottsdale, Arizona to Dallas, Texas. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $3.3 million   in restructuring charges related to our relocation. Of this amount, $2.7 million related to employee relocation costs, employee severance costs and furniture, fixture and equipment disposals at our prior headquarters, while the balance was for professional fees, consulting services, a lease loss reserve for our prior headquarters and other restructuring charges.  
  Property costs  
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , property costs were   $6.9 million   (including   $3.5 million   in tenant reimbursables) as compared to   $6.5 million   (including   $3.8 million   in tenant reimbursables) for the same period in 2015. Although total property costs remained relatively flat during the comparable periods, non-reimbursable property costs increased by approximately $0.8 million primarily due to increased property taxes primarily related to an increase in the number of vacant properties as compared to the same period a year ago.  
  Interest  
  The year-over-year decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the extinguishment of   $322.1 million   of mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate of   5.63%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest from our Term Loan, which was entered into during November 2015, and our Senior Unsecured Notes, which were issued in August 2016.  
  
   40 

The following table summarizes our interest expense on related borrowings from continuing operations: 

(1)     Includes interest expense associated with facility fees of approximately   $0.5 million   and   $0.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Depreciation and amortization  
  During the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired   261   properties, representing an investment in real estate of   $627.8 million  . During that same period we disposed of   120   properties with a gross investment of   $393.8 million  . Our net acquisitions during this period were partially offset by a reduction in our real estate investment value due to impairment charges during the twelve-month period ended   September 30, 2016   on properties that remain in our portfolio and a higher real estate value of properties held for sale compared to the prior period. Properties held for sale are no longer depreciated. The following table summarizes our depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations: 

Impairments 
  Impairment charges for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   includes $9.5 million on underperforming properties within the restaurant-casual dining, distribution and drug store/pharmacy industries and $4.4 million on properties held for sale. For the same period in   2015  , recorded impairment losses include $16.7 million on a consumer electronics property with a short-term lease expiration, $3.3 million on six properties that are held for sale, $1.0 million of lease intangible write-offs and an allowance for loan loss on an unsecured note receivable. 
  (Loss) gain on debt extinguishment     
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we extinguished   $322.1 million   of mortgage debt representing 62 loans and recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of   $8.3 million  . The loss was primarily attributable to the defeasance fees on 93 properties for the period. For the same period in   2015  , we extinguished $41.8 million of mortgage debt and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of   $0.3 million  .  
  Gain on disposition of assets 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the gain on disposition of 17 properties included $3.9 million from the sale of four Shopko properties and $10.3 million from the sale of one grocery property. For the same period in   2015  , the gain on disposition of assets was primarily attributable to a $3.0 million gain from the sale of three Shopko  
  
   41 

properties. The balance of the gain related to the sale of 12 additional properties including three vacant properties and two multi-tenant properties. 
   
  Results of Operations  
  Comparison of   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  The following discussion includes the results of our continuing operations as summarized in the table below:  

NM - Percentages over 100% are not displayed. 
  Revenues 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , approximately   94.8%   of our total revenues was attributable to long-term leases. The year-over-year   increase   of   2.8%   in total revenue was due primarily to an increase in base rental revenue resulting from real estate acquisitions subsequent to   September 30, 2015  , as well as recognition of other non-tenant income recorded in other income and interest from real estate transactions.  
  Rentals 
  The year-over-year   increase   in rental revenue was primarily attributable to the acquisition of   261   properties with an investment value of   $627.8 million   during the twelve-month period ended   September 30, 2016  . This   increase   was  
  
   42 

partially offset by the sale of   120   properties during the same period having an investment value of   $393.8 million  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , non-cash rentals were   $19.9 million   and   $17.8 million  , respectively, representing approximately   4.1%   and   3.8%   of total rental revenue from continuing operations, respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   98.4%   of our owned properties were occupied (based on number of properties). The majority of our nonperforming properties were in the convenience stores and restaurants-casual dining industries. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively,   43   and   37   properties of our owned properties, representing approximately   1.6%   and   1.5%   of our owned properties, were vacant and not generating rent. Of the   43   vacant properties,   11   were held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Tenant reimbursement income 
  We have a number of leases that require our tenants to reimburse us for certain property costs we incur. Tenant reimbursement income is driven by the tenant reimbursable property costs described below. 
  Other income and interest from real estate transactions 
  The year-over-year increase in other income and interest from real estate transactions is primarily due to $5.5 million in fee income associated with the prepayment of certain mortgage loans receivable and $4.2 million in lease termination income received from the Haggen settlement and one other property. The positive change from these revenue items was reduced by lease settlement fee income of $4.9 million recognized during the comparable prior period. 
  Expenses    
  General and administrative 
  The year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to a $3.8 million increase in professional fees and office expenses, $2.0 million of bad debt expense recorded in relation to four convenience store properties for which the rent has been determined to be uncollectible and a $1.7 million charge for the termination of our interest rate swaps. Higher professional fees include legal, consulting and temporary services attributable to our relocation to Dallas. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in compensation and related benefits of $3.9 million related to the forfeiture of previously recognized non-cash stock compensation following the departure of an executive officer in the current period.   
  Restructuring charges 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, we made the strategic decision to relocate our headquarters from Scottsdale, Arizona to Dallas, Texas. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $5.7 million   in restructuring charges related to our relocation. Of this amount, $4.8 million related to professional fees, consulting services, employee severance costs and a lease loss reserve for our prior headquarters, while the balance was for employee relocation costs and other restructuring charges. 
  Property costs  
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , property costs were   $20.9 million   (including   $10.5 million   of tenant reimbursables) compared to   $20.3 million   (including   $11.9 million   of tenant reimbursables) for the same period in   2015  .     Although total property costs remained relatively flat during the comparable periods, non-reimbursable property costs increased by approximately $1.4 million primarily due to increased property taxes primarily related to an increase in the number of vacant properties as compared to the same period a year ago.  
  Interest  
  The year-over-year   decrease   in interest expense is primarily due to the extinguishment of   $817.3 million   of mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate of   6.02%   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   decrease   was partially offset by an increase in interest from our Term Loan, which was entered into during November 2015, and our Senior Unsecured Notes, which were issued in August 2016.

The following table summarizes our interest expense on related borrowings from continuing operations: 

(1)     Includes interest expense associated with facility fees of approximately   $1.5 million   and   $1.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Depreciation and amortization  
  During the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired   261   properties, representing an investment in real estate of   $627.8 million  . During that same period we disposed of   120   properties with a gross investment of   $393.8 million  . Our net acquisitions during this period were partially offset by a reduction in our real estate investment value due to impairment charges during the twelve-month period ended   September 30, 2016   on properties that remain in our portfolio and a higher real estate value of properties held for sale compared to the prior period. Properties held for sale are no longer depreciated. The following table summarizes our depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations. The following table summarizes our depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations: 

Impairments 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , impairment losses included $20.0 million on seven under-performing properties within the restaurant-casual dining, movie theatre, distribution and drug store/pharmacy industries. In addition, impairment losses of $14.1 million were recorded on properties held for sale and $6.5 million were recorded from intangible lease write-offs, which were partially offset by a $0.3 million impairment recovery on a loan receivable. During the same period in   2015  , impairment losses included $45.5 million on 20 vacant or under-performing properties primarily within the education, consumer electronics and restaurant-casual dining industries. In addition, of the properties held for sale during the period, 23 properties incurred impairment losses of $11.2 million. The balance of the impairment loss included an allowance for loan loss on an unsecured note. 
  Gain on debt extinguishment 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we extinguished   $817.3 million   of mortgage debt and recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of   $0.3 million  . The gain was primarily attributable to the extinguishment of four defaulted mortgage loans upon transferring the properties collateralizing these loans to the lender, offset by losses from the defeasance fees on 391 properties. During the same period in   2015  , we retired $378.6 million in high interest rate CMBS debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.64%. 
  
   44 

Gain on disposition of assets 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we disposed of 82 properties and recorded gains totaling   $39.2 million  . These gains were primarily attributable to a $25.4 million gain from the sale of 21 properties within the restaurant-quick service industries, $10.3 million from the sale of one grocery property and a $8.4 million gain from the sale of nine Shopko properties. During the same period in   2015  , the gain on disposition of assets was primarily attributable to a $55.6 million gain from the sale of 24 Shopko properties. 
   
  Property Portfolio Information 
  Our diverse real estate portfolio at   September 30, 2016   consisted of   2,630   owned properties:  
              
    located in   49   states as well as in the U.S. Virgin Islands, with only   four   states each contributing greater than 5% of our rental revenue;  
                
    operating in   28   different industries;  
                 
    with a weighted average remaining lease term of   10.5   years.

  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  Short-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  On a short-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for short-term liquidity requirements, including financing of acquisitions, distributions to stockholders and interest and principal on current and any future debt financings. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, capital expenditures, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs and cash distributions to common stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility and Term Loan. Our 2015 Credit Facility and Term Loan increase our capacity to fund acquisitions, while continuing to meet our short-term working capital requirements. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $694.7 million   and   $0.0 million   borrowing capacity was available under the 2015 Credit Facility and Term Loan, respectively.  
  We have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we may issue secured or unsecured indebtedness and equity financing through the instruments and on the terms most attractive to us at such time. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership issued   $300.0 million   aggregate principal amount senior notes. The Senior Unsecured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation with a purchase price paid by the initial purchasers for the Senior Unsecured Notes of   99.378%   of the principal amount.  Net proceeds from this offering were used to initially repay amounts outstanding under the Company's Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes.  During 2016, we also sold a total of   6.3 million   shares under our ATM Program for net proceeds of   $77.7 million   after payment of commissions and other issuance costs of   $1.3 million  . The net proceeds were contributed to the Operating Partnership to repay outstanding borrowings and for general corporate purposes. In November 2016, the Corporation's Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million ATM Program, and the Corporation terminated its existing ATM Program. In addition, during April 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of   34.5 million   shares of our common stock and raised net proceeds of   $368.9 million  . The net proceeds were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the Term Loan. 
  In February 2016, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, which authorizes us to purchase up to $200.0 million of our common stock in the open market or through private transactions from time to time over the next 18 months. Purchase activity will be dependent on various factors, including our capital position, operating results, funds generated by asset sales, dividends that may be required by those sales, and investment options that may be available, including acquiring new properties or retiring debt. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to  
  repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. We intend to fund any repurchases with the net proceeds from asset sales, cash flows from operations, existing cash on the balance sheet and other sources. 
  Long-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We plan to meet our long-term capital needs, including long-term financing of property acquisitions, by issuing registered debt or equity securities, obtaining asset level financing and occasionally by issuing fixed rate secured or unsecured notes and bonds. We may continue to issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our 2015 Credit Facility, Term Loan or other indebtedness. In the future, some of our property acquisitions could be made by issuing partnership interests of our Operating Partnership in exchange for property owned by third parties. These partnership interests would be exchangeable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock. 
  We continually evaluate alternative financing and believe that we can obtain financing on reasonable terms. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and on terms that are acceptable to us. We expect that our primary uses of capital will be for property and other asset acquisitions and the payment of tenant improvements, operating expenses, including debt service payments on any outstanding indebtedness, and distributions to our stockholders. 
  Description of Certain Debt  
  Spirit Master Funding Program 
  The Spirit Master Funding Program is an asset-backed securitization platform in which we raise capital through the issuance of non-recourse net lease mortgage notes collateralized by commercial real estate, net leases and mortgage loans. The Spirit Master Funding Program allows us to issue notes that are secured by the assets of the special purpose entity note issuers that are pledged to the indenture trustee for the benefit of the noteholders and managed by the Operating Partnership as property manager. These Collateral Pools consist primarily of commercial real estate properties, the issuers  rights in the leases of such properties and commercial mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate properties. In general, monthly rental and mortgage receipts with respect to the leases and mortgage loans are deposited with the indenture trustee who will first utilize these funds to satisfy the debt service requirements on the notes and any fees and costs associated with the administration of the Spirit Master Funding Program. The remaining funds are remitted to the issuers monthly on the note payment date. 
  In addition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, the issuers may, from time to time, sell or exchange real estate properties or mortgage loans from the Collateral Pools. Proceeds from the sale of assets within the Collateral Pools are held on deposit by the indenture trustee until a qualifying substitution is made or the amounts are distributed as an early repayment of principal. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $16.0 million   was held on deposit and classified as restricted cash within deferred costs and other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. 
  The Spirit Master Funding Program consists of two separate securitization trusts that have one or multiple bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entities as issuers of the Master Trust 2013 and Master Trust 2014 notes. Each issuer is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. All outstanding series of Master Trust Notes were rated investment grade as of   September 30, 2016  . 

49 

The Master Trust Notes are summarized below:   

   (1)    Represents the individual series stated interest rate as of   September 30, 2016   and the weighted average stated rate of the total Master Trust Notes, based on the collective series outstanding principal balances as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Master Trust 2014 notes were secured by   863   owned and financed properties issued by   five   indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation. The notes issued under Master Trust 2014 are cross-collateralized by the assets of all issuers within this trust. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Master Trust 2013 notes were secured by   307   owned and financed properties issued by a single indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation.  
  Convertible Notes  
  The Convertible Notes are comprised of two series of notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $747.5 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes, aggregate principal amount   $402.5 million  , accrue interest at   2.875%   and are scheduled to mature on   May 15, 2019  . The 2021 Notes, aggregate principal amount   $345.0 million  , accrue interest at   3.75%   and are scheduled to mature on   May 15, 2021  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying amount of the Convertible Notes was   $699.5 million  , which is net of discounts (for the value of the embedded conversion feature) and unamortized deferred financing costs. 
  Holders may convert notes of either series prior to November 15, 2018, in the case of the 2019 Notes, or November 15, 2020, in the case of the 2021 Notes, only under the following circumstances: (1) if the closing price of our common stock for each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days in the quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the Convertible Notes; (2) during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last closing price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes; (3) if we call any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption prior to the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as described in the Convertible Notes prospectus supplement. On or after November 15, 2018, in the case of the 2019 Notes, or November 15, 2020, in the case of the 2021 Notes, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, holders may convert the Convertible Notes of the applicable series at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. 
  The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is 76.3636 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $13.10 per share of common stock). The conversion rate for each series of the Convertible Notes is subject to adjustment for some events, including dividends paid in excess of threshold amounts stipulated in the agreement, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. As of   September 30, 2016   the conversion rate was   76.7079   per   $1,000   principal note. If we undergo a fundamental  
  
   50 

change (as defined in the Convertible Notes supplemental indentures), holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus     accrued and unpaid interest. 
  2015 Credit Facility 
  On March 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership entered into the Credit Agreement that established a new $600.0 million unsecured credit facility and terminated its secured $400.0 million 2013 Credit Facility. The 2015 Credit Facility was subsequently amended in November 2015 and matures on March 31, 2019 (extendable at the Operating Partnership's option to March 31, 2020, subject to satisfaction of certain requirements). The amendment conforms certain of the terms and covenants to those in the Term Loan Agreement, including limiting the requirement of subsidiary guarantees to material subsidiaries (as defined) meeting certain conditions. The 2015 Credit Facility includes an accordion feature to increase the committed facility size to up to $1.0 billion, subject to satisfying certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments. On April 27, 2016, the Company expanded the borrowing capacity under the 2015 Credit Facility from $600.0 million to $800.0 million by partially exercising the accordion feature under the terms of the Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub-limit for swing-line loans and up to $60.0 million available for issuances of letters of credit. Swing-line loans and letters of credit reduce availability under the 2015 Credit Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis.  
  At the election of the Operating Partnership, the 2015 Credit Facility initially bears interest at our current leverage grid pricing equal to either LIBOR plus 1.40% to 1.90% per annum, or a specified base rate plus 0.40% to 0.90% per annum. In each case, the applicable rates depend on our leverage ratio. The Operating Partnership is initially required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the 2015 Credit Facility at a rate equal to either 0.15% or 0.25% per annum, based on percentage thresholds for the average daily amount by which the aggregate amount of the revolving credit commitment exceeds the aggregate principal amount of advances during a fiscal quarter. Per the amendment, the Operating Partnership s election to change the grid pricing from leverage based to credit rating based pricing initially requires at least two credit ratings of BBB- or better from S P or Fitch or Baa3 or better from Moody s. In April 2016, the Corporation received a first time rating of BBB- from Fitch and was upgraded to a BBB- corporate issuer rating by S P. As a result, the Operating Partnership elected to change the interest rate grid from leverage based pricing to credit rating based pricing in the second quarter of 2016. Under credit rating based pricing, the 2015 Credit Facility bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.875% to 1.55% per annum or a specified base rate plus 0.0% to 0.55% and requires a facility fee in an amount equal to the aggregate revolving credit commitments (whether or not utilized) multiplied by a rate equal to 0.125% to 0.30% per annum, in each case depending on the Corporation's credit rating. As of   September 30, 2016  , the 2015 Credit Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus   1.25%   based on our credit rating and incurred a facility fee of   0.25%   per annum. 
  The Operating Partnership may voluntarily prepay the 2015 Credit Facility, in whole or in part, at any time, without premium or penalty, but subject to applicable LIBOR breakage fees, if any. Payment of the 2015 Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation and material subsidiaries that meet certain conditions (as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no subsidiaries that met this requirement. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $105.0 million   borrowings were outstanding,   $0.3 million   of letters of credit were issued and   $694.7 million   of borrowing capacity was available under the 2015 Credit Facility. Amounts available for borrowing under the 2015 Credit Facility remain subject to compliance with certain customary restrictive covenants including: 
             
    Maximum leverage ratio (defined as consolidated total indebtedness plus the Corporation s pro rata share of indebtedness of unconsolidated affiliates, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total asset value) of 0.60:1.00, which may be increased to 0.65:1.00 for four consecutive quarters after certain material acquisitions; 
                
    Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as EBITDA plus the Corporation s pro rata share of EBITDA of unconsolidated affiliates, to fixed charges) of 1.50:1.00; 
                
    Maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio (defined as consolidated secured indebtedness plus the Corporation s pro rata share of secured indebtedness of unconsolidated affiliates, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total asset value) of 0.50:1:00; 
                
    Minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio (defined as consolidated net operating income from unencumbered properties, to unsecured interest expense) of 1.75:1.00; 
                
    Maximum unencumbered leverage ratio (defined as consolidated unsecured indebtedness plus the Corporation s pro rata share of unsecured indebtedness of unconsolidated affiliates, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total unencumbered asset value) of 0.60:1:00, which may be increased to 0.65:1.00 for four consecutive quarters after certain material acquisitions; and 
     
   51 

Minimum tangible net worth of at least $3.01 billion plus 75% of the net proceeds of equity issuances by the Corporation or the Operating Partnership after December 31, 2014. 
     In addition to these covenants, the Credit Agreement also includes other customary affirmative and negative covenants, such as (i) limitation on liens and negative pledges; (ii) transactions with affiliates; (iii) limitation on mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all assets; (iv) maintenance of status as a REIT and listing on any national securities exchange; and (v) material modifications to organizational documents.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with these covenants.  
  Line of Credit  
  A special purpose entity indirectly owned by the Corporation had access to a   $40.0 million   secured revolving line of credit, which expired on March 27, 2016.  
  Term Loan 
  On November 3, 2015, we entered into a Term Loan Agreement among the Operating Partnership as borrower, the Corporation as guarantor and the lenders that are parties thereto. The Term Loan Agreement provides for a   $325.0 million   senior unsecured term facility that has an initial maturity date of November 2, 2018, which may be extended at our option pursuant to two one-year extension options, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of an extension fee. In addition, an accordion feature allows the facility to be increased to up to $600.0 million, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments. In December 2015, upon obtaining additional lender commitments, we increased the term facility from   $325.0 million   to   $370.0 million  .  
  The Term Loan Agreement provides that borrowings bear interest at either LIBOR plus 1.35% to 1.80% per annum or a specified base rate plus 0.35% to 0.80% per annum, at the Operating Partnership's election. In each case, the applicable margin is determined based upon the Corporation s leverage ratio. If the Corporation obtains at least two credit ratings on its senior unsecured long-term indebtedness of BBB- from S P or Fitch, Inc. or Baa3 from Moody's, the Operating Partnership may make an irrevocable election to have the margin based upon the Corporation's credit ratings. In April 2016, the Corporation received a first time rating of BBB- from Fitch and was upgraded to a BBB- corporate issuer rating by S P. As a result, the Operating Partnership elected to change the interest rate grid from leverage based pricing to credit rating based pricing in the second quarter of 2016. Under credit rating based pricing, borrowings will bear interest at either LIBOR plus 0.90% to 1.75% per annum or a specified base rate plus 0.0% to 0.75% per annum, in each case depending on the Corporation s credit ratings. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR plus   1.35%   based on our credit rating. 
  The Operating Partnership may voluntarily prepay the Term Loan, in whole or in part, at any time, without premium or penalty, but subject to applicable LIBOR breakage fees. Borrowings may be repaid without premium or penalty, and may be re-borrowed within 30 days up to the then available loan commitment and subject to occurrence limitations within any twelve month period. Payment of the Term Loan is unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation and, under certain circumstances, by one or more material subsidiaries (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) of the Corporation. The obligations of the Operating Partnership and any guarantor under the Term Loan are full recourse to the Corporation and each guarantor. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Term Loan was fully drawn. Amounts available for borrowing under the Term Loan remain subject to compliance with certain customary restrictive covenants including: 
             
    Maximum leverage ratio (defined as consolidated total indebtedness plus the Corporation s pro rata share of indebtedness of unconsolidated affiliates, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total asset value) of 0.60:1.00, which may be increased to 0.65:1.00 for four consecutive quarters after certain material acquisitions  ; 
                
    Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as consolidated EBITDA plus the Corporation s pro rata share of EBITDA of unconsolidated affiliates, to fixed charges) of 1.50:1.00; 
                
    Maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio (defined as consolidated secured indebtedness plus the Corporation s pro rata share of secured indebtedness of unconsolidated affiliates, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total asset value) of 0.50:1:00; 
                
    Minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio (defined as consolidated net operating income from unencumbered properties, to unsecured interest expense) of 1.75:1.00; 
                
    Maximum unencumbered leverage ratio (defined as consolidated unsecured indebtedness plus the Corporation s pro rata share of unsecured indebtedness of unconsolidated affiliates, net of certain cash and  
     
   52 

cash equivalents, to total unencumbered asset value) of 0.60:1:00, which may be increased to 0.65:1.00 for four consecutive quarters after certain material acquisitions; and 
             
    Minimum tangible net worth of at least $3.01 billion plus 75% of the net proceeds of equity issuances by the Corporation or the Operating Partnership after December 31, 2014. 
     In addition, the Term Loan Agreement includes other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including (i) limitation on liens and negative pledges; (ii) transactions with affiliates; (iii) limitation on mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all assets; (iv) maintenance of status as a REIT and listing on a national securities exchange; and (v) material modifications to organizational documents. The ability to borrow under the Term Loan Agreement is subject to continued compliance with all of the covenants described above. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with these financial covenants. 
  Senior Unsecured Notes  
  On August 18, 2016, the Operating Partnership completed a private placement of   $300.0 million   aggregate principal amount senior notes, which are guaranteed by the Corporation. The Senior Unsecured Notes were issued at 99.378% of their principal amount, resulting in net proceeds of $296.2 million after deducting transaction fees and expenses. The Senior Unsecured Notes accrue interest at a rate of   4.450%   per year, payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, until the maturity date of September 15, 2026. We have agreed to file with the SEC and cause to become effective a registration statement pursuant to which we will offer to exchange the Senior Unsecured Notes for substantially similar registered notes.  
  The Senior Unsecured Notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Operating Partnership s option, at a redemption price equal to the sum of: an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, up to, but not including, the redemption date; and a make-whole premium calculated in accordance with the indenture.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any of the Senior Unsecured Notes are redeemed on or after June 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Senior Unsecured Notes), the redemption price will not include a make-whole premium.       
  In connection with the issuance of the Senior Unsecured Notes, the Corporation and Operating Partnership remain subject to compliance with certain customary restrictive covenants including: 
             
    Maximum leverage ratio (defined as consolidated total indebtedness, to total consolidated undepreciated real estate assets plus the Company s other assets, excluding accounts receivable and non-real estate intangibles) of 0.60:1.00; 
                
    Minimum unencumbered leverage ratio (defined as total consolidated undepreciated real estate assets plus the Company s other assets, excluding accounts receivable and non-real estate intangibles, to consolidated total unsecured indebtedness) of 1.50:1:00; 
                
    Maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio (defined as consolidated total secured indebtedness, to total consolidated undepreciated real estate assets plus the Company s other assets, excluding accounts receivable and non-real estate intangibles) of 0.40:1.00; and 
                
    Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as consolidated income available for debt service, to the annual service charge) of 1.5:1.0.   
     In addition, the Senior Unsecured Notes Agreement includes other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including (i) maintenance of status as a REIT; (ii) payment of all taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied on the REIT; (iii) reporting on financial information; and (iv) maintenance of properties and property insurance.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with these financial covenants. 
  CMBS  
  We may use long-term, fixed-rate debt to finance our properties on a  match-funded  basis. In such events, we generally seek to use asset level financing that bears annual interest less than the annual rent on the related lease(s) and that matures prior to the expiration of such lease(s). In general, the obligor of our asset level debt is a special purpose entity that holds the real estate and other collateral securing the indebtedness. Each special purpose entity is a  
  
   53 

bankruptcy remote separate legal entity, and is the sole owner of its assets and solely responsible for its liabilities other than typical non-recurring covenants.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   31   loans with approximately   $603.5 million   of outstanding principal balances under our CMBS fixed-rate loans, with a weighted average contractual interest rate of   5.63%   and a weighted average maturity of   3.7   years. Approximately 73% of this debt is partially amortizing and requires a balloon payment at maturity. These balances include   one   CMBS fixed-rate loan that is in default due to the underperformance of the   three   properties that secure it. As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate principal balance under the defaulted loan was   $28.6 million  , including   $8.8 million   of default interest added to principal, and is discussed further below. Excluding this loan, the outstanding principal obligations under our CMBS fixed-rate loans as of   September 30, 2016   was   $574.9 million  . 
  The table below shows the outstanding principal obligations of these CMBS fixed-rate loans as of   September 30, 2016   and the year in which the loans mature (dollars in thousands). The information displayed in the table excludes amounts and interest rates related to the defaulted loan and the   three   properties securing it.  

(1)    Excluding loans maturing in 2016, the scheduled principal will amortize subsequent to   September 30, 2016   until the maturity date of the loans. 
  CMBS Liquidity Matters 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we transferred   seven   properties with a net book value of   $34.7 million   and extinguished defaulted principal and accrued interest outstanding of   $64.1 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we are in default on   one   CMBS fixed-rate loan due to the underperformance of the properties securing this loan. The wholly-owned special purpose entity subject to this mortgage loan is a separate legal entity and the sole owner of its assets and responsible for its liabilities. The aggregate outstanding principal balance of this loan, including capitalized interest, totaled   $28.6 million  . We believe the value of these properties is less than the related debt. As a result, we have notified the lender of the special purpose entity that we anticipate either surrendering these properties to the lender or selling them in exchange for relieving the indebtedness, including any accrued interest, encumbering them.   
  The following table provides key elements of the defaulted mortgage loan (dollars in thousands) as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)    Interest capitalized to principal that remains unpaid. 
   (2)    Represents restricted cash controlled by the lender that may be applied to reduce the outstanding principal balance.

Debt Maturities     
  Future principal payments due on our various types of debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):  

(1)      The CMBS - fixed-rate payment balance in 2016 includes   $28.6 million  , including   $8.8 million   of capitalized interest, for the acceleration of principal payable following an event of default under   one   CMBS fixed-rate loan with a stated maturity in   2017  . 
  Contractual Obligations    
  There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the information regarding specified contractual obligations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the SEC.  
  We may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one-year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.  
  Distribution Policy    
  Distributions from our current or accumulated earnings and profits are generally classified as ordinary income, whereas distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, to the extent of a stockholder s federal income tax basis in our common stock, are generally characterized as a return of capital. Distributions in excess of a stockholder s federal income tax basis in our common stock are generally characterized as capital gain.  
  We are required to distribute 90% of our taxable income (subject to certain adjustments and excluding net capital gain) on an annual basis to maintain qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and are required to pay federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including capital gains).  
  We intend to make distributions that will enable us to meet the distribution requirements applicable to REITs and to eliminate or minimize our obligation to pay corporate-level federal income and excise taxes.  
  Any distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and their form, timing and amount, if any, will depend upon a number of factors, including our actual and projected results of operations, FFO, liquidity, cash flows and financial condition, the revenue we actually receive from our properties, our operating expenses, our debt service requirements, our capital expenditures, prohibitions and other limitations under our financing arrangements, our REIT taxable income, the annual REIT distribution requirements, applicable law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.

Cash Flows  
  Comparison of   Nine Months   Ended   September 30, 2016   to   Nine Months   Ended   September 30, 2015    
  The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively:  

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $13.2 million   of cash and cash equivalents as compared to   $21.8 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  Operating Activities 
  Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the rental rates specified in our leases, the collectability of rent and the level of our operating expenses and other general and administrative costs. 
  The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in debt extinguishment costs of   $21.6 million  , restructuring charge payments of   $7.9 million  , G A costs of   $5.8 million   and payments to terminate interest rate swap agreements of   $1.7 million  , offset by a reduction in cash paid for interest of   $19.0 million   and an increase in cash revenue of   $13.3 million  .  
  The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the acquisition of   261   properties, representing an investment in real estate during the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   totaling   $627.8 million  , partially offset by the disposition of   120   properties during the same period with an investment value of   $393.8 million  .  
  Investing Activities 
  Cash used in investing activities is generally used to fund property acquisitions, for investments in loans receivable and, to a limited extent, for capital expenditures. Cash provided by investing activities generally relates to the disposition of real estate and other assets. 
  Net cash used by investing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included cash proceeds of   $245.9 million   from the disposition of   82   properties (  6   of which were disposed of through a   $43.7 million   1031 Exchange), partially offset by   $424.5 million   to fund the acquisition of   227   properties (  33   of which were acquired through an   $83.6 million   non-cash 1031 Exchange) and capitalized real estate expenditures of   $8.3 million  . Net cash provided by investing activities also includes the collections of principal on loans receivable and real estate assets under direct financing leases totaling   $6.3 million  . 
  During the same period in   2015  , net cash used in investing activities included   $703.1 million   to fund the acquisition of   198   properties (  97   of which were acquired through a   $233.0 million   non-cash 1031 Exchange) and capitalized real estate expenditures of   $7.4 million  , partially offset by cash proceeds of   $397.3 million   from the disposition of   72   properties (  26   of which were disposed of through a   $235.4 million   non-cash 1031 Exchange). Net cash used in investing activities also included the release of sales proceeds from restricted cash accounts of   $40.1 million   and collections of principal on loans receivable and real estate assets under direct financing leases of   $4.5 million  , partially offset by investment in loans receivable of   $4.0 million  .  
  Financing Activities 
  Generally, our net cash used in and provided by financing activities is impacted by our net borrowings and common stock offerings, including sales of our common stock under our ATM Program, common stock offerings, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities and Term Loan, and issuances of net-lease mortgage notes under our Spirit Master Funding Program. 
  
   56 

Net cash used in financing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily attributable to repayment of our indebtedness of   $790.2 million   and the payment of dividends to equity owners of   $238.9 million  , both of which were paid primarily through sources from our operating cash flows and net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities, Term Loan and Senior Unsecured Notes. These amounts were partially offset by the sale of   6.3 million   shares of our common stock under our ATM Program for aggregate net proceeds of   $446.6 million  , net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities and Term Loan of   $150.0 million   and net proceeds of   $296.2 million   from the issuance of   $300 million   aggregate principal Senior Unsecured Notes (see Note 4).  
  During the same period in   2015  , net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to repayment of our indebtedness of   $347.2 million   and the payment of dividends to equity owners of   $216.2 million  , both of which were paid primarily through operating cash flows and net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities of   $59.8 million  . These amounts were partially offset by the issuance and sale of 23.0 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering and the sale of 6.6 million shares of our common stock under our ATM Program for aggregate net proceeds of   $347.2 million  , as well as transfers of funds held in reserve by lenders of   $17.9 million  .  
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
  FFO and AFFO 
  We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and net losses (gains) from property dispositions. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. We use FFO as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions and impairment charges, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of equity REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other equity REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and does not capture the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other equity REITs  FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders as a measure of our performance. 
  AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. Accordingly, AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders as a measure of our performance. We adjust FFO to eliminate the impact of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance, including restructuring costs, other general and administrative costs associated with relocation of our headquarters, default interest on non-recourse mortgage indebtedness, debt extinguishment gains (losses), costs associated with swap terminations, transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments subject to existing leases and certain non-cash items. These certain non-cash items include non-cash revenues (comprised of straight-line rents, amortization of above and below market rent on our leases, amortization of lease incentives, amortization of net premium (discount) on loans receivable and amortization of capitalized lease transaction costs), non-cash interest expense (comprised of amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of net debt discount/premium) and non-cash compensation expense (stock-based compensation expense). In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate AFFO as we do, and, accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to such other equity REITs' AFFO. AFFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a performance measure. A reconciliation of our FFO and AFFO to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) is included in the financial information accompanying this report. 
  
   57 

Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA 
  Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA modified to include other adjustments to GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for restructuring charges, real estate acquisition costs, impairment losses, gains/losses from the sale of real estate and debt transactions and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our on-going operating performance. We focus our business plans to enable us to sustain increasing shareholder value. Accordingly, we believe that excluding these items, which are not key drivers of our investment decisions and may cause short-term fluctuations in net income, provides a useful supplemental measure to investors and analysts in assessing the net earnings contribution of our real estate portfolio. Because these measures do not represent net income (loss) that is computed in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or as an indicator of financial performance. A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is included in the financial information accompanying this report. 
  Adjusted Debt  
  Adjusted Debt represents interest bearing debt (reported in accordance with GAAP) adjusted to exclude unamortized debt discount/premium and deferred financing costs, as further reduced by cash and cash equivalents and cash reserves on deposit with lenders as additional security. By excluding unamortized debt discount/premium and deferred financing costs, cash and cash equivalents, and cash reserves on deposit with lenders as additional security, the result provides an estimate of the contractual amount of borrowed capital to be repaid, net of cash available to repay it. We believe this calculation constitutes a beneficial supplemental non-GAAP financial disclosure to investors in understanding our financial condition. 
  Adjusted Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate the level of borrowed capital being used to increase the potential return of our real estate investments, and a proxy for a measure we believe is used by many lenders and ratings agencies to evaluate our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. We believe the ratio is a beneficial disclosure to investors as a supplemental means of evaluating our ability to meet obligations senior to those of our equity holders. Our computation of this ratio may differ from the methodology used by other equity REITs, and, therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of interest bearing debt (reported in accordance with GAAP) to Adjusted Debt is included in the financial information accompanying this report. 
  Initial Cash Yield 
  We calculate initial cash yield from properties by dividing the annualized first month base rent (excluding any future rent escalations provided for in the lease) by the gross investment in the related properties. Gross investment for an acquired property represents gross acquisition costs including the contracted purchase price and related capitalized transaction costs. Initial cash yield is a measure (expressed as a percentage) of the contractual cash rent expected to be earned on an acquired property in the first year. Because it excludes any future rent increases or additional rent that may be contractually provided for in the lease, as well as any other income or fees that may be earned from lease modifications or asset dispositions, initial cash yield does not represent the annualized investment rate of return of our acquired properties. Additionally, actual contractual cash rent earned from the properties acquired may differ from the initial cash yield based on other factors, including difficulties collecting anticipated rental revenues and unanticipated expenses at these properties that we cannot pass on to tenants, as well as the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   Capitalization Rate 
  We calculate the capitalization rate for disposed properties as the annualized cash rent on the date of disposition divided by the gross sales price. For multi-tenant properties, non-reimbursable property costs are deducted from the annualized cash rent prior to computing the capitalization rate. Annualized cash rent for a disposed property represents the annualized monthly contractual cash rent under the related lease at time of disposition.  
  
   58 

FFO and AFFO 
  The following is a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO and AFFO. Also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding used for the basic and diluted computations per share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 

(1)    For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net income attributable to common stockholders includes compensation for lost rent received from the Haggen Holdings, LLC settlement for 6 rejected stores as follows (in millions): 
                     Contractual rent from date of rejection through either sale or September 30, 2016 
    $ 
    1.3 
      
      Prepaid rent for the 3 stores subsequently sold 
    0.5

  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We are exposed to financial market risks, especially interest rate risk. Interest rates and other factors, such as occupancy, rental rates and the financial condition of our tenants, influence our performance more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. As described above, we generally offer leases that provide for payments of base rent with scheduled increases, based on a fixed amount or the lesser of a multiple of the increase in the CPI over a specified period term or fixed percentage and, to a lesser extent, contingent rent based on a percentage of the tenant s gross sales to help mitigate the effect of inflation. Because the properties in our portfolio are generally leased to tenants under triple-net leases, where the tenant is responsible for property operating costs and expenses, our exposure to rising property operating costs due to inflation is mitigated.  
  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and global economic and political conditions, and other factors which are beyond our control. Our operating results will depend heavily on the difference between the revenue from our assets and the interest expense incurred on our borrowings. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future, including amounts that we may borrow under our Revolving Credit Facilities and Term Loan. In addition, decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of real estate due to a reduction in desirable alternative income-producing investments. Increased competition for the acquisition of real estate may lead to a decrease in the yields on real estate we have targeted for acquisition. In such circumstances, if we are not able to offset the decrease in yields by obtaining lower interest costs on our borrowings, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Significant increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our earnings if we are unable to acquire real estate with rental rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings.  
  In the event interest rates rise significantly or there is an economic downturn, defaults may increase and result in credit losses, which may adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. In a decreasing interest rate environment, borrowers are generally more likely to prepay their loans in order to obtain financing at lower interest rates. However, the vast majority of our mortgage notes payable have prepayment clauses that make refinancing during a decreasing interest rate environment uneconomical. Investments in our mortgage loans receivable, however, have significant prepayment protection in the form of yield maintenance provisions, which provide us with substantial yield protection in a decreasing interest rate environment with respect to this portion of our investment portfolio.   
  The objective of our interest rate risk management policy is to match fund fixed-rate assets with fixed-rate liabilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , our assets were primarily long-term, fixed-rate leases (though most have scheduled rental increases during the terms of the leases). As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $3.33 billion   of our indebtedness consisted of long-term, fixed-rate obligations, consisting primarily of our Master Trust Notes, CMBS fixed-rate loans, Senior Unsecured Notes and Convertible Notes. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average stated interest rate of fixed-rate obligations, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts/premiums, was approximately   4.69%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $475.0 million   of our indebtedness consisted of variable-rate obligations, consisting primarily of our Term Loan. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average stated interest rate of our variable-rate obligations, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts/premiums, was approximately   1.86%  . If one-month LIBOR as of   September 30, 2016   increased by 100 basis points, or 1.0%, the resulting increase in annual interest expense with respect to the   $475.0 million   outstanding under the Term Loan would impact our future earnings and cash flows by   $4.8 million  . 
  We intend to continue our practice of employing interest rate derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps and futures, to reduce our exposure, on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis, to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate changes. We do not intend to enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We generally intend to utilize derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on our liabilities and not use derivatives for other purposes, such as hedging asset-related risks. Hedging transactions, however, may generate income which is not qualified income for purposes of maintaining our REIT status. We intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a REIT.  
  Even with hedging strategies in place, there can be no assurance that our results of operations will remain unaffected as a result of changes in interest rates. In addition, hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve additional risks such as counter-party credit risk and basis risk. Basis risk in a hedging contract occurs when the index upon  
  which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset or liability is based, thereby making the hedge less effective. We address basis risk by matching, to a reasonable extent, the contract index to the index upon which the hedged asset or liability is based. Our interest rate risk management policy addresses counterparty credit risk (the risk of nonperformance by counter-parties) by requiring that we deal only with major financial institutions that we deem credit worthy.  
  The estimated fair values of our Revolving Credit Facilities, Term Loan, Senior Unsecured Notes, fixed-rate and variable-rate mortgages and notes payable and Convertible Notes have been derived based on market quotes for comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analysis using estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows, market rates and credit spreads.  
  The following table discloses the fair value information for these financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):  

(1)    The carrying value of the debt instruments are net of unamortized deferred financing costs and certain debt discounts/premiums. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
    
  An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of    September 30, 2016   . Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. 
    
  As disclosed in Item 9A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed on October 31, 2016, the Company failed to design controls over the review of the accounting for real estate dispositions; specifically, the allocation of a portion of the Company s goodwill to the carrying amount of assets sold or held for sale when determining the gain or loss on sale to be recognized for sold assets or the amount, if any, of impairment losses to be recognized for assets held for sale. 
  Management became aware of this material weakness in internal control over financial reporting and took immediate actions to remediate the material weakness. The Company has initiated controls over the proper application of GAAP in accounting for goodwill related to the disposal of assets and in allocating goodwill to held for sale assets in determining the amount, if any, for impairment charges. The Company believes it will fully remediate this material weakness by December 31, 2016. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
    
  Except as noted in the preceding paragraph, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to material affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

All Securities of any one Series need not be issued at the same time and may be   issued from time to time, consistent with the terms of this Indenture, if so provided by or   pursuant to the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officer s Certificate referred   to above.   Section 2.3.  Execution and Authentication.   An Officer shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or facsimile   signature.    If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the   time the Security is authenticated, the Security shall nevertheless be valid.      

9   US-DOCS\51569310.11   A Security shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the   Trustee or an authenticating agent.  The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security   has been authenticated under this Indenture.   The Trustee shall at any time, and from time to time, authenticate Securities for   original issue in the principal amount provided in the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture   hereto or Officer s Certificate, upon receipt by the Trustee of a Company Order, Officer s   Certificate and Opinion of Counsel.  Such Company Order may authorize authentication and   delivery pursuant to electronic instructions from the Company or its duly authorized agent or   agents.

The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any   Securities of such Series: (a) if the Trustee determines that such action may not be taken   lawfully; or (b) if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that such action would expose the   Trustee to personal liability.   The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Company to   authenticate Securities.  An authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the   Trustee may do so.  Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes   authentication by such agent.  An authenticating agent has the same rights as the Trustee to deal   with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company.   Section 2.4.  Registrar and Paying Agent.   The Company shall maintain, with respect to each Series of Securities, at the   place or places specified with respect to such Series pursuant to Section 2.2, an office or agency   where Securities of such Series may be presented or surrendered for payment ( Paying Agent ),   where Securities of such Series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange   ( Registrar ) and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the   Securities of such Series and this Indenture may be delivered ( Notice Agent ).  The Registrar   shall keep a register with respect to each Series of Securities and to their transfer and exchange.    The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the name and address, and any   change in the name or address, of each Registrar, Paying Agent or Notice Agent.  If at any time   the Company shall fail to maintain any such required Registrar, Paying Agent or Notice Agent or   shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the name and address thereof, such presentations,      

10   US-DOCS\51569310.11   surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office, and the   Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders,   notices and demands; provided, however, that any appointment of the Trustee as the Notice   Agent shall exclude the appointment of the Trustee or any office of the Trustee as an agent to   receive the service of legal process on the Company.   The Company may also from time to time designate one or more co-registrars,   additional paying agents or additional notice agents and may from time to time rescind such   designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner   relieve the Company of its obligations to maintain a Registrar, Paying Agent and Notice Agent in   each place so specified pursuant to Section 2.2 for Securities of any Series for such purposes.    The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or   rescission and of any change in the name or address of any such co-registrar, additional paying   agent or additional notice agent.  The term  Registrar  includes any co-registrar; the term    Paying Agent  includes any additional paying agent; and the term  Notice Agent  includes any   additional notice agent.  The Company or any of its Affiliates may serve as Registrar or Paying   Agent.   The Company hereby appoints the Trustee the initial Registrar, Paying Agent and   Notice Agent for each Series unless another Registrar, Paying Agent or Notice Agent, as the case   may be, is appointed prior to the time Securities of that Series are first issued.   Section 2.5.  Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust.   The Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in   writing that the Paying Agent will hold in trust, for the benefit of Securityholders of any Series   of Securities, or the Trustee, all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of   or interest on the Series of Securities, and will notify the Trustee in writing of any default by the   Company in making any such payment.  While any such default continues, the Trustee may   require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee.  The Company at any time   may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee.  Upon payment over to   the Trustee, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company) shall   have no further liability for the money.  If the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company acts as   Paying Agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of   Securityholders of any Series of Securities all money held by it as Paying Agent.  Upon any   bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to the Company, the Trustee shall   serve as Paying Agent for the Securities.   Section 2.6.  Securityholder Lists.   The Registrar shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the   most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Securityholders of each Series of   Securities and shall otherwise comply with TIA    312(a).  If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the   Company shall furnish to the Trustee and Registrar at least ten days before each interest payment   date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing a list, in such form and as of   such date as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of Securityholders   of each Series of Securities.      

11   US-DOCS\51569310.11   Section 2.7.  Transfer and Exchange.   Where Securities of a Series are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a   request to register a transfer or to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of   the same Series, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange if its requirements   for such transactions are met.  To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Trustee   shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar s request.  No service charge shall be made for any   registration of transfer or exchange (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein), but the   Company may require payment by the applicable Securityholders of a sum sufficient to cover   any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any   such transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to Sections   2.11, 3.6 or 9.6).   Neither the Company nor the Registrar shall be required (a) to issue, register the   transfer of, or exchange Securities of any Series for the period beginning at the opening of   business fifteen days immediately preceding the sending of a notice of redemption of Securities   of that Series selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day such notice   is sent, or (b) to register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any Series selected, called or   being called for redemption as a whole or the portion being redeemed of any such Securities   selected, called or being called for redemption in part.   Section 2.8.  Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.   If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute   and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same   Series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously   outstanding.   If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their   satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity   bond as may be required by each of them to hold itself and any of its agents harmless, then, in   the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a   bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon receipt of a Company Order the   Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or   stolen Security, a new Security of the same Series and of like tenor and principal amount and   bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.   In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is   about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new   Security, pay such Security.   Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may   require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may   be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the   Trustee) connected therewith.   Every new Security of any Series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any   destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of      

12   US-DOCS\51569310.11   the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time   enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and   proportionately with any and all other Securities of that Series duly issued hereunder.   The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent   lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated,   destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.   Section 2.9.  Outstanding Securities.   The Securities outstanding at any time are all the Securities authenticated by the   Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in   the interest on a Global Security effected by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions hereof   and those described in this Section as not outstanding.   If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.8, it ceases to be outstanding until   the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide   purchaser.   If the Paying Agent (other than the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company or an   Affiliate of the Company) holds on the Maturity of Securities of a Series money sufficient to pay   all amounts payable in respect of such Securities on that date, then on and after that date such   Securities of the Series cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.   The Company may purchase or otherwise acquire the Securities, whether by open   market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise.  A Security does not cease to be   outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security (but see   Section 2.10 below).   In determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of   outstanding Securities have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent   or waiver hereunder, the principal amount of a Discount Security that shall be deemed to be   outstanding for such purposes shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and   payable as of the date of such determination upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity   thereof pursuant to Section 6.2.   Section 2.10.  Treasury Securities.   In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities   of a Series have concurred in any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or   waiver, Securities of a Series owned by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall be   disregarded, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in   relying on any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver only   Securities of a Series that a Responsible Officer actually knows are so owned shall be so   disregarded.      

13   US-DOCS\51569310.11   Section 2.11.  Temporary Securities.   Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and   the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities upon a Company Order.  Temporary   Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that   the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities.  Without unreasonable delay, the   Company shall prepare and the Trustee upon receipt of a Company Order shall authenticate   definitive Securities of the same Series and date of maturity in exchange for temporary   Securities.  Until so exchanged, temporary securities shall have the same rights under this   Indenture as the definitive Securities.   Section 2.12.  Cancellation.   The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation.    The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to   them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment.  The Trustee shall cancel all Securities   surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and shall destroy such   canceled Securities (subject to the record retention requirement of the Exchange Act and the   Trustee) and deliver a certificate of such cancellation to the Company upon written request of the   Company.  The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities that it has paid or   delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.   Section 2.13.  Defaulted Interest.   If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on a Series of Securities, it shall   pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent permitted by law, any interest payable on the   defaulted interest, to the persons who are Securityholders of the Series on a subsequent special   record date.  The Company shall fix the record date and payment date.  At least 10 days before   the special record date, the Company shall send to the Trustee and to each Securityholder of the   Series a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of interest to   be paid.  The Company may pay defaulted interest in any other lawful manner.   Section 2.14.  Global Securities.   2.14.1.     Terms of Securities.  A Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture   hereto or an Officer s Certificate shall establish whether the Securities of a Series shall be issued   in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities and the Depositary for such   Global Security or Securities.   2.14.2.     Transfer and Exchange.  Notwithstanding any provisions to the   contrary contained in Section 2.7 of the Indenture and in addition thereto, any Global Security   shall be exchangeable pursuant to Section 2.7 of the Indenture for Securities registered in the   names of Holders other than the Depositary for such Security or its nominee only if (i) such   Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such   Global Security or if at any time such Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under   the Exchange Act, and, in either case, the Company fails to appoint a successor Depositary   registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act within 90 days of such event or (ii) the   Company executes and delivers to the Trustee an Officer s Certificate to the effect that such      

14   US-DOCS\51569310.11   Global Security shall be so exchangeable.  Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to   the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Securities registered in such names as the   Depositary shall direct in writing in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount   of the Global Security with like tenor and terms.   Except as provided in this Section 2.14.2, a Global Security may not be   transferred except as a whole by the Depositary with respect to such Global Security to a   nominee of such Depositary, by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another   nominee of such Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary   or a nominee of such a successor Depositary.   2.14.3.     Legends.  Any Global Security issued hereunder shall bear a legend in   substantially the following form:    THIS SECURITY IS A GLOBAL SECURITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF   THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME   OF THE DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY.  THIS SECURITY IS   EXCHANGEABLE FOR SECURITIES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON   OTHER THAN THE DEPOSITARY OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE LIMITED   CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE, AND MAY NOT BE   TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE   DEPOSITARY, BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY TO THE DEPOSITARY OR   ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY THE DEPOSITARY OR ANY SUCH   NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF SUCH A SUCCESSOR   DEPOSITARY.    In addition, so long as the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ) is the Depositary,   each Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee shall bear a legend in   substantially the following form:    UNLESS THIS GLOBAL NOTE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED   REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK   CORPORATION ( DTC ), TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF   TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY GLOBAL NOTE ISSUED IS   REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE   CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS   REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT   IS MADE TO CEDE   CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN   AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER   USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL   INASMUCH THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE   CO., HAS AN INTEREST   HEREIN.    2.14.4.     Acts of Holders.  The Depositary, as a Holder, may appoint agents and   otherwise authorize participants to give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction,   notice, consent, waiver or other action which a Holder is entitled to give or take under the   Indenture.      

15   US-DOCS\51569310.11   2.14.5.     Payments.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Indenture,   unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.2, payment of the principal of and   interest, if any, on any Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof.   2.14.6.     Consents, Declaration and Directions.  The Company, the Trustee and   any Agent shall treat a person as the Holder of such principal amount of outstanding Securities of   such Series represented by a Global Security as shall be specified in a written statement of the   Depositary or by the applicable procedures of such Depositary with respect to such Global   Security, for purposes of obtaining any consents, declarations, waivers or directions required to   be given by the Holders pursuant to this Indenture and the Trustee shall have no liability or   responsibility for any action or inaction of the Depositary or any depositary or clearinghouse.   Section 2.15.  CUSIP Numbers.   The Company in issuing the Securities may use  CUSIP  numbers (if then   generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use  CUSIP  numbers in notices of redemption as a   convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made   as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any   notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other elements of   identification printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any   defect in or omission of such numbers.   ARTICLE III.   REDEMPTION   Section 3.1.  Notice to Trustee.   The Company may, with respect to any Series of Securities, reserve the right to   redeem and pay the Series of Securities or may covenant to redeem and pay the Series of   Securities or any part thereof prior to the Stated Maturity thereof at such time and on such terms   as provided for in such Securities.  If a Series of Securities is redeemable and the Company   wants or is obligated to redeem prior to the Stated Maturity thereof all or part of the Series of   Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, it shall notify the Trustee in writing of the   redemption date and the principal amount of Series of Securities (identified by CUSIP) to be   redeemed.  The Company shall give the notice at least 15 days before the redemption date, unless   a shorter period is satisfactory to the Trustee.   Section 3.2.  Selection of Securities to be Redeemed.   Unless otherwise indicated for a particular Series by a Board Resolution, a   supplemental indenture hereto or an Officer s Certificate, if less than all the Securities of a Series   are to be redeemed, the Securities of the Series to be redeemed will be selected as follows:  (a) if   the Securities are in the form of Global Securities, in accordance with the procedures of the   Depositary, (b) if the Securities are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance   with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the   Securities are listed, or (c) if not otherwise provided for under clause (a) or (b) in the manner that   the Trustee deems fair and appropriate, including by lot or other method, unless otherwise   required by law or applicable stock exchange requirements, subject, in the case of Global      

16   US-DOCS\51569310.11   Securities, to the applicable rules and procedures of the Depositary.  The Securities to be   redeemed shall be selected from Securities of the Series outstanding not previously called for   redemption.  Portions of the principal of Securities of the Series that have denominations larger   than $1,000 may be selected for redemption.  Securities of the Series and portions of them it   selected for redemption shall be in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of $1,000 or, with   respect to Securities of any Series issuable in other denominations pursuant to Section 2.2.10, the   minimum principal denomination for each Series and the authorized integral multiples thereof.    Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities of a Series called for redemption also apply   to portions of Securities of that Series called for redemption.   Section 3.3.

The notice shall identify the Securities of the Series to be redeemed and shall   state:   (a)    the redemption date;   (b)    the redemption price;   (c)    the name and address of the Paying Agent;   (d)    if any Securities are being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal   amount of such Securities to be redeemed and that, after the redemption date and upon   surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities in principal amount equal to the   unredeemed portion of the original Security shall be issued in the name of the Holder   thereof upon cancellation of the original Security;   (e)    that Securities of the Series called for redemption must be surrendered to   the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price;   (f)    that interest on Securities of the Series called for redemption ceases to   accrue on and after the redemption date unless the Company defaults in the deposit of the   redemption price;   (g)    the CUSIP number, if any; and   (h)    any other information as may be required by the terms of the particular   Series or the Securities of a Series being redeemed.   At the Company s request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the   Company s name and at its expense.        

17   US-DOCS\51569310.11   Section 3.4.  Effect of Notice of Redemption.   Once notice of redemption is sent as provided in Section 3.3, Securities of a   Series called for redemption become due and payable on the redemption date and at the   redemption price.  Except as otherwise provided in the supplemental indenture, Board Resolution   or Officer s Certificate for a Series, a notice of redemption may not be conditional.  Upon   surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price plus accrued   interest to the redemption date.   Section 3.5.  Deposit of Redemption Price.   On or before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the redemption date, the   Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the redemption price of   and accrued interest, if any, on all Securities to be redeemed on that date.   Section 3.6.  Securities Redeemed in Part.   Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Trustee shall   authenticate for the Holder a new Security of the same Series and the same maturity equal in   principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.   ARTICLE IV.   COVENANTS   Section 4.1.  Payment of Principal and Interest.   The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of the Holders of each Series   of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of and interest, if any, on the   Securities of that Series in accordance with the terms of such Securities and this Indenture.  On   or before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the applicable payment date, the Company shall   deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the principal of and interest, if any, on the   Securities of each Series in accordance with the terms of such Securities and this Indenture.   Section 4.2.  SEC Reports.   To the extent any Securities of a Series are outstanding, the Company shall   deliver to the Trustee within 15 days after it files them with the SEC copies of the annual reports   and of the information, documents, and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the   foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company is required to   file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.  The Company also shall   comply with the other provisions of TIA   314(a). Reports, information and documents filed   with the SEC via the EDGAR system will be deemed to be delivered to the Trustee as of the time   of such filing via EDGAR for purposes of this Section 4.2.   Delivery of reports, information and documents to the Trustee under this Section   4.2 are for informational purposes only and the Trustee s receipt of the foregoing shall not   constitute constructive or actual notice of any information contained therein or determinable   from information contained therein, including the Company s compliance with any of their      

18   US-DOCS\51569310.11   covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer s   Certificates).  The Trustee shall nave no liability or responsibility for the filing, timeliness or   content of any such report.   Section 4.3.  Compliance Certificate.   To the extent any Securities of a Series are outstanding, the Company shall   deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, an   Officer s Certificate stating that a review of the activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries   during the preceding fiscal year has been made under the supervision of the signing Officers with   a view to determining whether the Company has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled its   obligations under this Indenture, and further stating, as to each such Officer signing such   certificate, that to the best of his/her knowledge the Company has kept, observed, performed and   fulfilled each and every covenant contained in this Indenture and is not in default in the   performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions hereof (or, if a Default   or Event of Default shall have occurred, describing all such Defaults or Events of Default of   which the Officer may have knowledge and the steps to be taken to cure such Defaults or Events   of Default).   Section 4.4.  Stay, Extension and Usury Laws.   The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not   at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or   advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in   force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture or the Securities; and   the Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or   advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay   or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit   the execution of every such power as though no such law has been enacted.   ARTICLE V.   SUCCESSORS   Section 5.1.  When Company May Merge, Etc.   The Company shall not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer   or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets to, any person (a  successor person )   unless:   (a)    the Company is the surviving corporation or the successor person (if other   than the Company) is a corporation organized and validly existing under the laws of any   U.S. domestic jurisdiction and expressly assumes the Company s obligations on the   Securities and under this Indenture; and   (b)    immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of   Default, shall have occurred and be continuing.      

19   US-DOCS\51569310.11   The Company shall deliver to the Trustee prior to the consummation of the   proposed transaction an Officer s Certificate to the foregoing effect and an Opinion of Counsel   stating that the proposed transaction and any supplemental indenture comply with this Indenture.   Notwithstanding the above, any Subsidiary of the Company may consolidate with,   merge into or transfer all or part of its properties to the Company. Neither an Officer s   Certificate nor an Opinion of Counsel shall be required to be delivered in connection therewith if   the Company is the surviving entity.   Section 5.2.  Successor Corporation Substituted.   Upon any consolidation or merger, or any sale, lease, conveyance or other   disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 5.1,   the successor corporation formed by such consolidation or into or with which the Company is   merged or to which such sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition is made shall succeed to,   and be substituted for, by execution of a supplemental indenture, and may exercise every right   and power of, the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor person   has been named as the Company herein; provided, however, that the predecessor Company in the   case of a sale, conveyance or other disposition (other than a lease) shall be released from all   obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities.   ARTICLE VI.   DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES   Section 6.1.  Events of Default.    Event of Default,  wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any Series,   means any one of the following events, unless in the establishing Board Resolution,   supplemental indenture or Officer s Certificate, it is provided that such Series shall not have the   benefit of said Event of Default:   (a)    default in the payment of any interest on any Security of that Series when   it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days   (unless the entire amount of such payment is deposited by the Company with the Trustee   or with a Paying Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., New  York City time, on the 30th day of such   period); or   (b)    default in the payment of principal of any Security of that Series at its   Maturity; or   (c)    default in the performance or breach of any covenant or warranty of the   Company in this Indenture (other than defaults pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) above or   pursuant to a covenant or warranty that has been included in this Indenture solely for the   benefit of Series of Securities other than that Series), which default continues uncured for   a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the   Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least   25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of that Series a written notice      

20   US-DOCS\51569310.11   specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such   notice is a  Notice of Default  hereunder; or   (d)    the Company pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:   (i) commences a voluntary case,   (ii) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an   involuntary case,   (iii) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for all or   substantially all of its property,   (iv) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or   (v) generally is unable to pay its debts as the same become due; or   (e)    a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any   Bankruptcy Law that:   (i) is for relief against the Company in an involuntary case,   (ii) appoints a Custodian of the Company or for all or substantially all   of its property, or   (iii) orders the liquidation of the Company,   and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days; or   (f)    any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that   Series, which is specified in a Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture hereto or an   Officer s Certificate, in accordance with Section 2.2.18.    The term  Bankruptcy Law  means title 11, U.S. Code or any similar Federal or   State law for the relief of debtors.  The term  Custodian  means any receiver, trustee, assignee,   liquidator or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.   The Company will provide the Trustee written of notice of any Default or Event   of Default within 30 days of becoming aware of the occurrence of such Default or Event of   Default, which notice will describe in reasonable detail the status of such Default or Event of   Default and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.   Section 6.2.  Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.   If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any Series at the time   outstanding occurs and is continuing (other than an Event of Default referred to in Section 6.1(d)   or (e)) then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal   amount of the outstanding Securities of that Series may declare the principal amount (or, if any   Securities of that Series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be      

21   US-DOCS\51569310.11   specified in the terms of such Securities) of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all of the   Securities of that Series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the   Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal   amount (or specified amount) and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, shall become immediately   due and payable.  If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(d) or (e) shall occur, the   principal amount (or specified amount) of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all   outstanding Securities shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any   declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.   At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to any Series has   been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by   the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount   of the outstanding Securities of that Series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee,   may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if all Events of Default with respect   to Securities of that Series, other than the non-payment of the principal and interest, if any, of   Securities of that Series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have   been cured or waived as provided in Section 6.13.   No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right   consequent thereon.   Section 6.3.  Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.   The Company covenants that if   (a)    default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such   interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or   (b)    default is made in the payment of principal of any Security at the Maturity   thereof, or   (c)    default is made in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, if any, when   and as due by the terms of a Security,   then, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of   such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and   interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on   any overdue principal and any overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such   Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs   and expenses of collection, including the compensation, reasonable expenses, disbursements and   advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.   If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the   Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for   the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or   final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such   Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or deemed to be payable in the manner provided by      

22   US-DOCS\51569310.11   law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever   situated.   If an Event of Default with respect to any Securities of any Series occurs and is   continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the   rights of the Holders of Securities of such Series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the   Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific   enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any   power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.   Section 6.4.  Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.   In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,   reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the   Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such   other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities   shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective   of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue   principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or   otherwise,   (a)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal and interest   owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents   as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any   claim for the compensation, reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances of the   Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding,   and   (b)    to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable   on any such claims and to distribute the same,   and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in   any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the   Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly   to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the compensation, reasonable   expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other   amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7.   Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or   consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement,   adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to   authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

23   US-DOCS\51569310.11   Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of   judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the compensation, reasonable expenses,   disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of   the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.   Section 6.6.  Application of Money Collected.

Section 6.7.  Limitation on Suits.   No Holder of any Security of any Series shall have any right to institute any   proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a   receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless   (a)    such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a   continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that Series;   (b)    the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding   Securities of that Series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute   proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;   (c)    such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security   satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be   incurred by the Trustee in compliance with such request;   (d)    the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of   indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and   (e)    no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the   Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the   outstanding Securities of that Series;      

24   US-DOCS\51569310.11   it being understood, intended and expressly covenanted by the Holder of every Security with   every other Holder and the Trustee that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in   any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect,   disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain   priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture,   except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders of   the applicable Series.   Section 6.8.  Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal and Interest.   Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security   shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of   and interest, if any, on such Security on the Maturity of such Security, including the Stated   Maturity expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the redemption date) and   to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired   without the consent of such Holder.   Section 6.9.  Restoration of Rights and Remedies.   If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or   remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any   reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such   case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders   shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all   rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding   had been instituted.   Section 6.10.  Rights and Remedies Cumulative.   Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of   mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in Section 2.8, no right or remedy herein conferred   upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or   remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in   addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or   in equity or otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or   otherwise, shall not, to the extent permitted by law, prevent the concurrent assertion or   employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.   Section 6.11.  Delay or Omission Not Waiver.   No delay or omission of the Trustee, any Agent or of any Holder of any Securities   to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right   or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.  Every   right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be   exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the   Holders, as the case may be.      

25   US-DOCS\51569310.11   Section 6.12.  Control by Holders.   The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any   Series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for   any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee,   with respect to the Securities of such Series, provided that   (a)    such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this   Indenture,   (b)    the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which   is not inconsistent with such direction,   (c)    subject to the provisions of Section 7.1, the Trustee shall have the right to   decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that the   proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability, and   (d)    prior to taking any action as directed under this Section 6.12, the Trustee   shall be entitled to indemnity and security satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses   and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction.   Section 6.13.  Waiver of Past Defaults.   The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding   Securities of any Series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such Series, by   written notice to the Trustee and the Company, waive any past Default hereunder with respect to   such Series and its consequences, except a Default in the payment of the principal of or interest   on any Security of such Series (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal   amount of the outstanding Securities of any Series may rescind an acceleration and its   consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration).  Upon   any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom   shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall   extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.   Section 6.14.  Undertaking for Costs.   All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his   acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in   any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against   the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party   litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its   discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys  fees, against any party litigant   in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by   such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the   Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of   Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the outstanding   Securities of any Series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the   payment of the principal of or interest on any Security on or after the Maturity of such Security,      

26   US-DOCS\51569310.11   including the Stated Maturity expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the   redemption date).   ARTICLE VII.   TRUSTEE   Section 7.1.  Duties of Trustee.   (a)    If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall   exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of   care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the   circumstances in the conduct of such person s own affairs.   (b)    Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:   (i) The Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set   forth in this Indenture and no others.   (ii) In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may   conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the   opinions expressed therein, upon Officer s Certificates or Opinions of Counsel   furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture;   however, in the case of any such Officer s Certificates or Opinions of Counsel   which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the   Trustee, the Trustee shall examine such Officer s Certificates and Opinions of   Counsel to determine whether or not they conform to the form requirements of   this Indenture.   (c)    The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent   action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:   (i) This paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this   Section.   (ii) The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in   good faith, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the   pertinent facts.   (iii) The Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken,   suffered or omitted to be taken by it with respect to Securities of any Series in   good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in   principal amount of the outstanding Securities of such Series relating to the time,   method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the   Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this   Indenture with respect to the Securities of such Series in accordance with Section   6.12.      

27   US-DOCS\51569310.11   (d)    Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is   subject to paragraph (a), (b) and (c) of this Section.

(f)    The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it   except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company.  Money held in trust by the   Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.   (g)    No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to risk its own   funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties, or   in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if adequate indemnity against such risk is   not assured to the Trustee in its satisfaction.   (h)    Each Agent and any authenticating agent shall be entitled to the   protections and immunities as are set forth in Article 7 with respect to the Trustee.   Section 7.2.  Rights of Trustee.   (a)    The Trustee may conclusively rely on and shall be protected in acting or   refraining from acting upon any document (whether in its original or facsimile form)   believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person.    The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.   (b)    Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officer s   Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both.  The Trustee shall not be liable for any   action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such Officer s Certificate or   Opinion of Counsel.   (c)    The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the   misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.

(d)    The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in   good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers, provided that   the Trustee s conduct does not constitute willful misconduct or negligence.   (e)    The Trustee may consult with counsel and the advice of such counsel or   any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect   of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder without willful misconduct or   negligence, and in reliance thereon.   (f)    The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or   powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of

(g)    The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or   matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,   request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness   or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further   inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit.   (h)    The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of   Default unless a Responsible Officer has actual knowledge thereof or unless written   notice of any event which is in fact such a default is actually received by the Trustee at   the Corporate Trust Office, and such notice references the Securities generally or the   Securities of a particular Series and this Indenture.   (i)    In no event shall the Trustee be liable to any person for special, punitive,   indirect, consequential or incidental loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including   but not limited to lost profits), even if the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of   such loss or damage.   (j)    The permissive right of the Trustee to take the actions permitted by this   Indenture shall not be construed as an obligation or duty to do so.   (k)    Under no circumstances shall the Trustee be liable in its individual   capacity, or otherwise, for the obligations evidenced by the Securities.    (l)    The Trustee shall have no obligation to undertake any calculation   hereunder or have any liability for any calculation performed in connection herewith or   the transactions contemplated hereunder.

Any Agent may do the same with like   rights.  The Trustee is also subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11.   Section 7.4.  Trustee s Disclaimer.   The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this   Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company s use of the proceeds   from the Securities, and it shall not be responsible for any statement in the Securities other than   its authentication.      

29   US-DOCS\51569310.11   Section 7.5.  Notice of Defaults.   If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the   Securities of any Series and if it is actually known to a Responsible Officer, the Trustee shall   send to each Securityholder of the Securities of that Series notice of such Default or Event of   Default within 90 days after it occurs or, if later, after a Responsible Officer has knowledge of   such Default or Event of Default.  Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment   of principal of or interest on any Security of any Series, the Trustee may withhold the notice if   and so long as it in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interest of   Securityholders of that Series.   Section 7.6.  Reports by Trustee to Holders.   Within 60 days after each anniversary of the date of this Indenture, the Trustee   shall deliver to all Securityholders, as their names and addresses appear on the register kept by   the Registrar, a brief report dated as of such anniversary date, in accordance with, and to the   extent required under, TIA   313.   A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders of any Series   shall be filed with the SEC and each national securities exchange on which the Securities of that   Series are listed.  The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee when Securities of any Series   are listed (or delisted as the case may be) on any national securities exchange.   Section 7.7.  Compensation and Indemnity.   The Company shall pay to the Trustee (acting in any capacity hereunder) from   time to time compensation for its services as the Company and the Trustee shall from time to   time agree upon in writing.  The Trustee s compensation shall not be limited by any law on   compensation of a trustee of an express trust.  The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon   request for all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by it.  Such expenses shall include the   reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee s agents and counsel.   The Company shall indemnify each of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee   (including for the cost of defending itself) against any cost, expense or liability, including taxes   (other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee) incurred   by it except as set forth in the next paragraph in the performance of its duties under this   Indenture as Trustee or Agent.  The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for   which it may seek indemnity, although the failure to so notify shall not negate any   indemnification obligation hereunder.  The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall   cooperate in the defense.  The Trustee may have one separate counsel and the Company shall   pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel.  The Company need not pay for any   settlement made without its consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.  This   indemnification shall apply to officers, directors, employees, shareholders and agents of the   Trustee.   The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or   liability incurred by the Trustee or by any officer, director, employee, shareholder or agent of the      

30   US-DOCS\51569310.11   Trustee through willful misconduct or negligence, as determined by a court of competent   jurisdiction in a final non-appealable order.     To secure the Company s payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall   have a lien prior to the Securities of any Series on all money or property held or collected by the   Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Securities of that   Series.   When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default   specified in Section 6.1(d) or (e) occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are   intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.   The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Indenture and   the resignation or removal of the Trustee.   Section 7.8.  Replacement of Trustee.   A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee   shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee s acceptance of appointment as provided   in this Section.   The Trustee may resign with respect to the Securities of one or more Series by so   notifying the Company at least 30 days prior to the date of the proposed resignation.  The   Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any Series may remove the Trustee   with respect to that Series by so notifying the Trustee and the Company at least 30 days prior.    The Company may, upon 30-day notice, remove the Trustee with respect to Securities of one or   more Series if:   (a)    the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;   (b)    the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is   entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;   (c)    a Custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or   (d)    the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.   If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee   for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.  Within one year after   the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then   outstanding Securities may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee   appointed by the Company.   If a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any one or more Series   does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring   Trustee (at the expense of the Company in the case of a petition by the Trustee), the Company or   the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities of the applicable Series   may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.      

31   US-DOCS\51569310.11   A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the   retiring Trustee and to the Company.  Immediately after that, the retiring Trustee shall transfer   all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee subject to the lien provided for in   Section 7.7, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the   successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee with respect to each   Series of Securities for which it is acting as Trustee under this Indenture.  A successor Trustee   shall mail a notice of its succession to each Securityholder of each such Series.  Notwithstanding   replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.8, the Company s obligations under Section   7.7 hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee with respect to expenses and   liabilities incurred by it for actions taken or omitted to be taken in accordance with its rights,   powers and duties under this Indenture prior to such replacement.  The resigning or removed   Trustee shall have no liability or responsibility for the action or inaction of any successor   Trustee.   Section 7.9.  Successor Trustee by Merger, Etc.   If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or   substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation   without any further act shall be the successor Trustee, subject to Section 7.10.   Section 7.10.  Eligibility; Disqualification.   This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of TIA     310(a)(1), (2) and (5).  The Trustee shall always have a combined capital and surplus of at least   $25,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition.  The Trustee   shall comply with TIA   310(b).   Section 7.11.  Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.   The Trustee is subject to TIA   311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed   in TIA   311(b).  A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA   311(a)   to the extent indicated.   ARTICLE VIII.   SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE; DEFEASANCE   Section 8.1.  Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.   This Indenture shall upon Company Order be discharged with respect to the   Securities of any Series and cease to be of further effect as to all Securities of such Series (except   as hereinafter provided in this Section 8.1), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall   execute instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when   (a)    either   (i) all Securities of such Series theretofore authenticated and delivered   (other than Securities that have been destroyed, lost or stolen and that have been   replaced or paid) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or      

32   US-DOCS\51569310.11   (ii) all such Securities of such Series not theretofore delivered to the   Trustee for cancellation   (1) have become due and payable by reason of sending a notice   of redemption or otherwise, or   (2) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity   within one year, or   (3) have been called for redemption or are to be called for   redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee   for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at   the expense, of the Company, or   (4) are deemed paid and discharged pursuant to Section 8.3, as   applicable;   and the Company, in the case of (1), (2) or (3) above, shall have irrevocably deposited or caused   to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust an amount of money or U.S. Government   Obligations, which amount shall be sufficient for the purpose of paying and discharging each   installment of principal (including mandatory sinking fund or analogous payments) of and   interest on all the Securities of such Series on the dates such installments of principal or interest   are due;   (b)    the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable   hereunder by the Company; and   (c)    the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer s Certificate   and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for   relating to the satisfaction and discharge contemplated by this Section have been   complied with.   Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations   of the Company to the Trustee under Section 7.7, and, if money shall have been deposited with   the Trustee pursuant to clause (a) of this Section, the provisions of Sections 2.4, 2.7, 2.8, 8.2 and    8.5 shall survive.   Section 8.2.  Application of Trust Funds; Indemnification.   (a)    Subject to the provisions of Section 8.5, all money and U.S. Government   Obligations or Foreign Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to   Section 8.1, 8.3 or 8.4 and all money received by the Trustee in respect of U.S.   Government Obligations or Foreign Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee   pursuant to Section 8.1, 8.3 or 8.4, shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance   with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or   through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as   the Trustee may determine, to the persons entitled thereto, of the principal and interest for   whose payment such money has been deposited with or received by the Trustee or to      

33   US-DOCS\51569310.11   make mandatory sinking fund payments or analogous payments as contemplated by   Sections 8.1, 8.3 or 8.4.   (b)    The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee against any tax,   fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against U.S. Government Obligations or   Foreign Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Sections 8.1, 8.3 or 8.4 or the   interest and principal received in respect of such obligations other than any payable by or   on behalf of Holders.   (c)    The Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon   Company Order any U.S. Government Obligations or Foreign Government Obligations   or money held by it as provided in Sections 8.3 or 8.4 which, in the opinion of a   nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants or investment   bank expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are then in   excess of the amount thereof which then would have been required to be deposited for the   purpose for which such U.S. Government Obligations or Foreign Government   Obligations or money were deposited or received.

AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS   Section 9.1.  Without Consent of Holders.   The Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the   Securities of one or more Series without the consent of any Securityholder:   (a)    to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;   (b)    to comply with Article V;   (c)    to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of   certificated Securities;   (d)    to add guarantees with respect to Securities of any Series or secure   Securities of any Series;   (e)    to surrender any of the Company s rights or powers under this Indenture;   (f)    to add covenants or events of default for the benefit of the holders of   Securities of any Series;   (g)    to comply with the applicable procedures of the applicable depositary;   (h)    to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any   Securityholder;   (i)    to provide for the issuance of and establish the form and terms and   conditions of Securities of any Series as permitted by this Indenture;   (j)    to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a   successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more Series and to add to or   change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or   facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee; or      

37   US-DOCS\51569310.11   (k)    to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the   qualification of this Indenture under the TIA.   Section 9.2.  With Consent of Holders.   The Company and the Trustee may enter into a supplemental indenture with the   written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding   Securities of each Series affected by such supplemental indenture (including consents obtained in   connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Securities of such Series), for the   purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the   provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the   rights of the Securityholders of each such Series.  Except as provided in Section 6.13, the   Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any Series by   notice to the Trustee (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange   offer for the Securities of such Series) may waive compliance by the Company with any   provision of this Indenture or the Securities with respect to such Series.   It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Securities under this   Section 9.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture or waiver, but   it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.  After a supplemental   indenture or waiver under this section becomes effective, the Company shall send to the Holders   of Securities affected thereby, a notice briefly describing the supplemental indenture or waiver.    Any failure by the Company to send such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any   way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture or waiver.   Section 9.3.  Limitations.   Without the consent of each Securityholder affected, an amendment or waiver   may not:   (a)    reduce the principal amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to   an amendment, supplement or waiver;   (b)    reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest (including   default interest) on any Security;   (c)    reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Security or   reduce the amount of, or postpone the date fixed for, the payment of any sinking fund or   analogous obligation;   (d)    reduce the principal amount of Discount Securities payable upon   acceleration of the maturity thereof;   (e)    waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or   interest, if any, on any Security (except a rescission of acceleration of the Securities of   any Series by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding   Securities of such Series and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such   acceleration);      

38   US-DOCS\51569310.11   (f)    make the principal of or interest, if any, on any Security payable in any   currency other than that stated in the Security;   (g)    make any change in Sections 6.8, 6.13 or 9.3 (this sentence); or   (h)    waive a redemption payment with respect to any Security, provided that   such redemption is made at the Company s option.   Section 9.4.  Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.   Every amendment to this Indenture or the Securities of one or more Series shall   be set forth in a supplemental indenture hereto that complies with the TIA as then in effect.   Section 9.5.  Revocation and Effect of Consents.   Until an amendment is set forth in a supplemental indenture or a waiver becomes   effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Security is a continuing consent by the Holder and   every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as   the consenting Holder s Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security.    However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his Security or   portion of a Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date of the   supplemental indenture or the date the waiver becomes effective.   Any amendment or waiver once effective shall bind every Securityholder of each   Series affected by such amendment or waiver unless it is of the type described in any of clauses   (a) through (h) of Section 9.3.  In that case, the amendment or waiver shall bind each Holder of a   Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a   Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder s Security.   The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose   of determining the Holders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above   or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then   notwithstanding the second immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders   at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those persons, shall be entitled to   give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or take any such action, whether or   not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or   effective for more than 120 days after such record date.   Section 9.6.  Notation on or Exchange of Securities.   The Company or the Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an   amendment or waiver on any Security of any Series thereafter authenticated.  The Company in   exchange for Securities of that Series may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate upon receipt   of a Company Order in accordance with Section 2.3 new Securities of that Series that reflect the   amendment or waiver.      

39   US-DOCS\51569310.11   Section 9.7.  Trustee Protected.   In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental   indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this   Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 7.1) shall be fully   protected in relying upon, an Officer s Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both complying   with Section 10.4.  The Trustee shall sign all supplemental indentures upon delivery of such an   Officer s Certificate or Opinion of Counsel or both, except that the Trustee need not sign any   supplemental indenture that adversely affects its rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under this   Indenture. Each Opinion of Counsel provided in connection with the execution of a supplemental   indenture shall also provide that the supplemental indenture is the legal, valid and binding   obligation of the Company (and any Guarantor) in accordance with its terms.

If a notice or communication is sent or published in the manner provided above,   within the time prescribed, it is duly given, whether or not the Securityholder receives it.   If the Company sends a notice or communication to Securityholders, it shall send   a copy to the Trustee and each Agent at the same time.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or any Security, where this   Indenture or any Security provides for notice of any event (including any notice of redemption)   to a Holder of a Global Security (whether by mail or otherwise), such notice shall be sufficiently   given to the Depositary for such Security (or its designee) pursuant to the customary procedures   of such Depositary.    Section 10.3.  Communication by Holders with Other Holders.   Securityholders of any Series may communicate pursuant to TIA   312(b) with   other Securityholders of that Series or any other Series with respect to their rights under this   Indenture or the Securities of that Series or all Series.

Section 10.6.  Rules by Trustee and Agents.   The Trustee may make reasonable rules for action by or a meeting of   Securityholders of one or more Series.  Any Agent may make reasonable rules and set reasonable   requirements for its functions.   Section 10.7.  Legal Holidays.   Unless otherwise provided by Board Resolution, Officer s Certificate or   supplemental indenture hereto for a particular Series, a  Legal Holiday  is any day that is not a   Business Day.  If a payment date is a Legal Holiday at a place of payment, payment may be   made at that place on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday, and no interest shall   accrue for the intervening period.   Section 10.8.  No Recourse Against Others.   A director, officer, employee, partner, member, manager or stockholder (past or   present), as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company   under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such   obligations or their creation.  Each Securityholder by accepting a Security waives and releases all   such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.

Unless   otherwise specified in a Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture hereto or an Officer s   Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Indenture with respect to a particular Series   of Securities, such conversion shall be at the spot rate for the purchase of the designated currency   as published in The Financial Times in the  Currency Rates  section (or, if The Financial Times   is no longer published, or if such information is no longer available in The Financial Times, such   source as may be selected in good faith by the Company) on any date of determination.

Section 10.18. U.S.A. Patriot Act.   The parties hereto acknowledge that in accordance with Section 326 of the U.S.A.   Patriot Act, the Trustee, like all financial institutions and in order to help fight the funding of   terrorism and money laundering, is required to obtain, verify, and record information that   identifies each person or legal entity that establishes a relationship or opens an account with the   Trustee.

(a) For purposes of any provision of the Indenture which provides for the   delivery by the Guarantor of an Officer s Certificate and/or an Opinion of Counsel, the definitions   of such terms in Section 1.2 shall apply to the Guarantor as if references therein to the Company or   the Guarantor, as applicable, were references to the Guarantor.       

23   US-DOCS\51573375.10   (b) Any notice or demand which by any provision of the Indenture is required   or permitted to be given or served by the Trustee or by the Holders of Notes to or on the Guarantor   may be given or served as described in Section 10.2 of the Base Indenture as if references therein   to the Company were references to the Guarantor.    (c) Upon any demand, request or application by the Guarantor to the Trustee to   take any action under the Indenture, the Guarantor shall furnish to the Trustee such Officer s   Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as are required in Section 10.1 as if all references therein to the   Company were references to the Guarantor.     ARTICLE VI      ADDITIONAL COVENANTS    The following additional covenants shall apply with respect to the Notes so long as any of   the Notes remain outstanding:    Section 6.1 Limitations on Incurrence of Debt.    (a) Aggregate Debt Test. The Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of its   Subsidiaries to, incur any Debt if, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such   additional Debt and the application of the proceeds of the additional Debt on a pro forma basis, the   aggregate principal amount of all the Guarantor s outstanding Debt and that of its Subsidiaries on a   consolidated basis as determined in accordance with GAAP is greater than 60% of the sum of   (without duplication):    (i) the Guarantor s Total Assets as of the end of the fiscal quarter   covered in the Guarantor s Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on   Form 10-Q, as the case may be, most recently filed with the SEC (or, if such filing   is not permitted under the Exchange Act, furnished to the Trustee) prior to the   incurrence of such additional Debt; and     (ii) the purchase price of any real estate assets or mortgages receivable   acquired, and the amount of any securities offering proceeds received (to the extent   such proceeds were not used to acquire real estate assets or mortgages receivable or   used to reduce Debt), by the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries since the end of   such fiscal quarter, including those proceeds obtained in connection with the   incurrence of such additional Debt.   (b) Debt Service Test.  The Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of its   Subsidiaries to, incur any Debt if the ratio of Consolidated Income Available for Debt Service to   the Annual Service Charge for the most recent quarterly period covered in the Guarantor s Annual   Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as the case may be, most recently filed   with the SEC (or, if such filing is not permitted under the Exchange Act, furnished to the Trustee)   prior to such time, annualized (i.e., multiplied by four) prior to the date on which such additional   Debt is to be incurred shall have been less than 1.5, on a pro forma basis after giving effect thereto   and to the application of the proceeds therefrom, and calculated on the assumption that:    (i) such Debt and any other Debt incurred by the Guarantor or its   Subsidiaries since the first day of such quarterly period and the application of the   proceeds therefrom, including to refinance other Debt since the first day of such    period, had occurred at the beginning of such period;    (ii) the repayment or retirement of any other Debt (other than Debt   repaid or retired with the proceeds of any other Debt, which repayment or   retirement shall be calculated pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(i) and not to this Section   6.1(b)(ii)) by the Guarantor or its Subsidiaries since the first day of such quarterly   period had been repaid or retired at the beginning of such period (except that, in   making such computation, the amount of Debt under any revolving credit facility,   line of credit or similar facility shall be computed based upon the average daily   balance of such Debt during such period);    (iii) in the case of Acquired Debt or Debt incurred by the Guarantor or   any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any acquisition since the first day of such      

24   US-DOCS\51573375.10   quarterly period, the related acquisition had occurred as of the first day of such   period with the appropriate adjustments with respect to such acquisition being   included in such pro forma calculation; and    (iv) in the case of any acquisition or disposition by the Guarantor or any   of its Subsidiaries of any asset or group of assets since the first day of such   quarterly period, whether by merger, stock purchase or sale, or asset purchase or   sale, such acquisition or disposition and any related repayment of Debt had   occurred as of the first day of such period with the appropriate adjustments with   respect to such acquisition or disposition being included in such pro forma   calculation.    If the Debt giving rise to the need to make the calculation described in this Section 6.1 or any other   Debt incurred after the first day of the relevant quarterly period bears interest at a floating rate (to   the extent such Debt has been hedged to bear interest at a fixed rate, only the portion of such Debt,   if any, that has not been so hedged), then, for purposes of calculating the Annual Debt Service   Charge, the interest rate on such Debt will be computed on a pro forma basis as if the average   interest rate that would have been in effect during the entire such period had been the applicable   rate for the entire such period.    (c) Maintenance of Total Unencumbered Assets.  The Guarantor and its   Subsidiaries may not at any time own Total Unencumbered Assets equal to less than 150% of the   aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Unsecured Debt of the Guarantor and its   Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.    (d) Secured Debt Test. The Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of its   Subsidiaries to, incur any Debt  secured by any mortgage, lien, charge, pledge, encumbrance or   security interest upon any of the Guarantor s property or the property of any of its Subsidiaries,   whether owned at the date hereof or hereafter acquired, if, immediately after giving effect to the   incurrence of such additional Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, the aggregate   principal amount of all of the Guarantor s outstanding Debt and the outstanding Debt of its   Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for borrowed money that is secured by any mortgage, lien,   charge, pledge, encumbrance or security interest on the Guarantor s property or the property of   any of its Subsidiaries is greater than 40% of the sum of (without duplication):     (i) the Guarantor s Total Assets as of the end of the fiscal quarter   covered in the Guarantor s Annual  Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report   on Form 10-Q, as the case may be, most recently filed with the SEC (or, if such   filing is not permitted under the Exchange Act, furnished to the Trustee) prior   to the incurrence of such additional Debt; and     (ii) the purchase price of any real estate assets or mortgages   receivable acquired, and the amount of any securities offering proceeds   received (to the extent such proceeds were not used to acquire real estate assets   or mortgages receivable or used to reduce Debt), by the Guarantor or any of its   Subsidiaries since the end of such fiscal quarter, including those proceeds   obtained in connection with the incurrence of such additional Debt.   For purposes of this Section 6.1, Debt shall be deemed to be  incurred  by the Guarantor or any of   its Subsidiaries whenever the Guarantor or such Subsidiary shall create, assume, guarantee or   otherwise become liable in respect thereof.  Furthermore, nothing in the covenants described under   this Section 6.1 shall prevent the incurrence by the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries of Debt   between or among the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.    Section 6.2 Existence.    Except as permitted below, the Guarantor will do or cause to be done all things necessary   to preserve and keep in full force and effect the existence, rights, both charter and statutory, and   franchises of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Guarantor will not be   required to preserve any right or franchise if the Guarantor determines that the preservation of the   right or franchise is no longer desirable in the conduct of the Guarantor s business and that the loss   of the right or franchise is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders of the Notes.       

25   US-DOCS\51573375.10   Section 6.3 Merger, Consolidation or Sale.    The Company and the Guarantor may consolidate with, or sell, lease or convey all or   substantially all of our respective assets to, or merge with or into, any other entity, provided that   the following conditions are met:    (a) the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be the   continuing entity, or the successor entity (if other than Company or the Guarantor, as the case   may be) formed by or resulting from any consolidation or merger or which shall have received   the transfer of assets shall expressly assume payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and   interest, on, all of the Notes and the due and punctual performance and observance of all of the   covenants and conditions in the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement;   (b) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Event of Default   under the Indenture, and no event which, after notice or the lapse of time, or both, would   become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing; and    (c) an Officer s Certificate covering these conditions shall be delivered to   the Trustee.    In the case of any such consolidation, sale, conveyance or merger, but not a lease, in a transaction   in which there is a successor entity, the successor entity will succeed to, and be substituted for, the   Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, under the Indenture and, subject to the terms of the   Indenture, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, will be released from their   respective obligations under the Indenture.    Section 6.4 Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.   The Guarantor will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same   shall become delinquent, all taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied or imposed upon   the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries or upon the Guarantor s  or any such Subsidiary s income,   profits or property and all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might   by law become a lien upon the Guarantor s or any such Subsidiary s property; provided, however,   that the Guarantor will not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any   such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in   good faith by appropriate proceedings.    Section 6.5 Provision of Financial Information.   Whether or not we or the Guarantor is subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act,   the Guarantor will, to the extent permitted under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC the annual   reports, quarterly reports and other documents that the Guarantor would have been required to file   with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13 or 15(d) (the  Financial Statements ) if the Guarantor   were so subject, such documents to be filed with the SEC on or prior to the respective dates (the    Required Filing Dates ) by which the Guarantor would have been required so to file such   documents if the Guarantor were so subject.    The Guarantor will also in any event (1) within 15 days of each Required Filing Date (a)   transmit by mail or electronic transmittal to all Holders, as their names and addresses appear in the   security register, without cost to such Holders, copies of the annual reports, quarterly reports and   other documents that the Guarantor is required to file or would have been required to file with the   SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if the Guarantor were subject to such   sections, and (b) furnish to the Trustee copies of annual reports, quarterly reports and other   documents that the Guarantor would have been required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section   13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if the Guarantor were subject to such sections; provided that the   foregoing transmittal and furnishing requirements will be deemed satisfied if the foregoing reports   and documents are available on the SEC s EDGAR system or on the Guarantor s website within   the applicable time period specified above, and (2) if filing such documents by the Guarantor with   the SEC is not permitted under the Exchange Act, promptly upon written request and payment of   the reasonable cost of duplication and delivery, supply copies of such documents to any   prospective Holder. Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for   informational purposes only and the Trustee s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive   notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein,      

26   US-DOCS\51573375.10   including our compliance with any of the covenants thereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled   to rely conclusively on an Officer s Certificate). The Trustee shall have no liability or   responsibility for the filing, timeliness or content of any such report.    For so long as any of the Notes remain outstanding and constitute  restricted securities    under Rule 144, the Company will furnish to the Holders and prospective Holders, upon their   request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities   Act.   Section 6.6 Maintenance of Properties.   The Guarantor will cause all of its properties used or useful in the conduct of the   Guarantor s business or the business of any of its Subsidiaries to be maintained and kept in good   condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment and will cause to be   made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements of the   Guarantor s and its Subsidiaries  properties, all as in the Guarantor s judgment may be necessary   so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously   conducted at all times; provided, however, that the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries will not be   prevented from selling or otherwise disposing for value the Guarantor s or its Subsidiaries    properties in the ordinary course of business.    Section 6.7 Insurance.   The Guarantor will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, keep in force upon all of its   properties and operations policies of insurance carried with responsible companies in such   amounts and covering all such risks as shall be customary in the industry in accordance with   prevailing market conditions and availability.

The Operating Partnership and the Guarantors shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to complete   the Exchange Offer as provided above and shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the   Exchange Act and other applicable laws and regulations in connection with the Exchange Offer.  The Exchange   Offer shall not be subject to any conditions, other than that the Exchange Offer does not violate any applicable law   or applicable interpretations of the Staff.   (b) In the event that (i) the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors determine that the Exchange   Offer Registration provided for in Section 2(a) hereof is not available or the Exchange Offer may not be completed   as soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date because it would violate any applicable law or applicable   interpretations of the Staff, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not for any other reason completed by the Target Registration   Date or (iii) upon receipt of a written request (a  Shelf Request ) from any Initial Purchaser representing that it   holds Registrable Securities acquired directly from the Operating Partnership or one of its affiliates that are or were   ineligible to be exchanged in the Exchange Offer, the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors shall use their   commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be filed as soon as practicable after such determination, date or Shelf   Request, as the case may be, a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the sale of all the Registrable Securities by   the Holders thereof and to have such Shelf Registration Statement become effective; provided that no Holder will be   entitled to have any Registrable Securities included in any Shelf Registration Statement, or entitled to use the   prospectus forming a part of such Shelf Registration Statement, until such Holder shall have delivered a completed   and signed Notice and Questionnaire and provided such other information regarding such Holder to the Operating   Partnership as is contemplated by Section 3(b) hereof.      

6   ACTIVE 215355635v.8   In the event that the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors are required to file a Shelf Registration   Statement pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors shall use   their commercially reasonable efforts to file and have become effective both an Exchange Offer Registration   Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof with respect to all Registrable Securities and a Shelf Registration   Statement (which may be a combined Registration Statement with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) with   respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities acquired directly from the Operating Partnership or one of its   affiliates held by the Initial Purchasers after completion of the Exchange Offer.     The Operating Partnership and the Guarantors agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to keep   the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the Securities cease to be Registrable Securities (the    Shelf Effectiveness Period ).  The Operating Partnership and the Guarantors further agree to supplement or amend   the Shelf Registration Statement, the related Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus if required by the rules,   regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Operating Partnership for such Shelf   Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder or if reasonably   requested by a Holder of Registrable Securities with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to use their   commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective, if required, and such Shelf   Registration Statement, Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, to become usable as soon as   thereafter practicable.  The Operating Partnership and the Guarantors agree to furnish to the Participating Holders   copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC.     (c) The Operating Partnership and the Guarantors shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection   with any registration pursuant to Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) hereof.  Each Holder shall pay all underwriting   discounts and commissions, brokerage commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of   such Holder s Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.    (d) An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof will not be deemed to   have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC.  A Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to   Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC or   is automatically effective upon filing with the SEC as provided by Rule 462 under the Securities Act.   (e) If a Registration Default occurs, the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by   (i) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period beginning on the day immediately following such Registration   Default and (ii) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, in each case until and   including the date such Registration Default ends, up to a maximum increase of 0.50% per annum.  A Registration   Default ends when the Securities cease to be Registrable Securities or, if earlier, (1) in the case of a Registration   Default under clause (i) of the definition thereof, when the Exchange Offer is completed, (2) in the case of a   Registration Default under clause (ii) or clause (iii) of the definition thereof, when the Shelf Registration Statement   becomes effective or (3) in the case of a Registration Default under clause (iv) or clause (v) of the definition thereof,   when the Shelf Registration Statement again becomes effective or the Prospectus again becomes usable.  If at any   time more than one Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, then, until the next date that there is no   Registration Default, the increase in interest rate provided for by this paragraph shall apply as if there occurred a   single Registration Default that begins on the date that the earliest such Registration Default occurred and ends on   such next date that there is no Registration Default.   (f) The provisions for the payment of additional interest set forth in Section 2(e) shall be the only   monetary remedy available to Holders for the Company s and the Guarantors  failure to cause the Exchange Offer   Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement to become effective, or continue to be effective, as the   case may be, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  The Operating Partnership and the Guarantors   acknowledge that any failure by the Operating Partnership or the Guarantors to comply with their obligations under   Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders   for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries   precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as   may be required to specifically enforce the Operating Partnership s and the Guarantors  obligations under   Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof.

8   ACTIVE 215355635v.8   Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, including the receipt by the Operating   Partnership of any notice of objection of the SEC to the use of a Shelf Registration Statement or any post-   effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act, (4) if, between the   applicable effective date of a Shelf Registration Statement and the closing of any sale of Registrable   Securities covered thereby, the representations and warranties of the Operating Partnership or any   Guarantor contained in any underwriting agreement, securities sales agreement or other similar agreement,   if any, relating to an offering of such Registrable Securities cease to be true and correct in all material   respects or if the Operating Partnership or any Guarantor receives any notification with respect to the   suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of   any proceeding for such purpose, (5) of the happening of any event during the period a Registration   Statement is effective that makes any statement made in such Registration Statement or the related   Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any   changes in such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus in order to make the   statements therein not misleading and (6) of any determination by the Operating Partnership or any   Guarantor that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to   the Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus would be appropriate;    (vii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order   suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or, in the case of a Shelf Registration, the   resolution of any objection of the SEC pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act, including by   filing an amendment to such Registration Statement on the proper form, at the earliest possible moment and   provide immediate notice to each Holder or Participating Holder of the withdrawal of any such order or   such resolution;    (viii) in the case of a Shelf Registration, furnish to each Participating Holder, without charge,   at least one conformed copy of each Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto   (without any documents incorporated therein by reference or exhibits thereto, unless requested);    (ix) in the case of a Shelf Registration, cooperate with the Participating Holders to facilitate   the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold and not   bearing any restrictive legends and enable such Registrable Securities to be issued in such denominations   and registered in such names (consistent with the provisions of the Indenture) as such Participating Holders   may reasonably request at least one Business Day prior to the closing of any sale of Registrable Securities;    (x) upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(a)(vi)(5) hereof, use their   commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a supplement or post-effective   amendment to the applicable Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement or the   related Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or   file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered (or, to the extent permitted by law, made   available) to purchasers of the Registrable Securities, such Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, as the   case may be, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact   necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not   misleading; and the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors shall notify the Participating Holders (in the   case of a Shelf Registration Statement) and the Initial Purchasers and any Participating Broker-Dealers   known to the Operating Partnership (in the case of an Exchange Offer Registration Statement) to suspend   use of the Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of   such an event, and such Participating Holders, such Participating Broker-Dealers and the Initial Purchasers,   as applicable, hereby agree to suspend use of the Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus, as the case   may be, until the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors have amended or supplemented the Prospectus   or the Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, to correct such misstatement or omission;

and the Operating Partnership and the   Guarantors shall not, at any time after initial filing of a Registration Statement, use or file any Prospectus,   any Free Writing Prospectus, any amendment of or supplement to a Registration Statement or a Prospectus   or a Free Writing Prospectus, or any document that is to be incorporated by reference into a Registration   Statement, a Prospectus or a Free Writing Prospectus, of which the Initial Purchasers and their counsel   (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Participating Holders and their counsel) shall not   have previously been advised and furnished a copy or to which the Initial Purchasers or their counsel (and,   in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Participating Holders or their counsel) shall object;    (xii) obtain a CUSIP number for all Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case   may be, not later than the initial effective date of a Registration Statement;    (xiii) cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act in connection with the   registration of the Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be;

   (xiv) in the case of a Shelf Registration, make available for inspection by a representative of   the Participating Holders (an  Inspector ), any Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to   such Shelf Registration Statement, any attorneys and accountants designated by a majority in aggregate   principal amount of the Securities held by the Participating Holders and any attorneys and accountants   designated by such Underwriter, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, all pertinent financial and   other records, documents and properties of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, and cause the   respective officers, directors and employees of the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors to supply all   information reasonably requested by any such Inspector, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection   with a Shelf Registration Statement; provided that if any such information is identified by the Operating   Partnership or any Guarantor as being confidential or proprietary, each Person receiving such information   shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to protect the confidentiality of such information to the   extent such action is otherwise not inconsistent with, an impairment of or in derogation of the rights and   interests of any Inspector, Holder or Underwriter);   (xv) in the case of a Shelf Registration, use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause all   Registrable Securities to be listed on any securities exchange or any automated quotation system on which   similar securities issued or guaranteed by the Operating Partnership or any Guarantor are then listed if   requested by the Majority Holders, to the extent such Registrable Securities satisfy applicable listing   requirements;    (xvi) if reasonably requested by any Participating Holder, promptly include in a Prospectus   supplement or post-effective amendment such information with respect to such Participating Holder as such   Participating Holder reasonably requests to be included therein and make all required filings of such   Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as the Operating Partnership has received   notification of the matters to be so included in such filing;    (xvii) in the case of a Shelf Registration, enter into such customary agreements and take all   such other actions in connection therewith (including those requested by the Holders of a majority in   principal amount of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement) in order to   expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities including, but not limited to, an   Underwritten Offering and in such connection, (1) to the extent possible, make such representations and   warranties to the Participating Holders and any Underwriters of such Registrable Securities with respect to   the business of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries and the Registration Statement, Prospectus,

(b) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Operating Partnership may require each Holder   of Registrable Securities to furnish to the Operating Partnership a Notice and Questionnaire and such other   information regarding such Holder and the proposed disposition by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the   Operating Partnership and the Guarantors may from time to time reasonably request in writing.   (c) Each Participating Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Operating Partnership   and the Guarantors of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(a)(vi)(3) or Section 3(a)(vi)(5)   hereof, such Participating Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the   Shelf Registration Statement until such Participating Holder s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended   Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(a)(x) hereof and, if so directed by the   Operating Partnership and the Guarantors, such Participating Holder will deliver to the Operating Partnership and   the Guarantors all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Participating Holder s   possession, of the Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that is current at   the time of receipt of such notice.   (d) If the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors shall give any notice to suspend the disposition of   Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement, the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors shall   extend the period during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this   Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and   including the date when the Holders of such Registrable Securities shall have received copies of the supplemented or   amended Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. Any such suspensions   shall not exceed 45 days (whether or not consecutive) in any three-month period or 90 days (whether or not   consecutive) in any 12-month period.   (e) The Participating Holders who desire to do so may sell such Registrable Securities in an   Underwritten Offering.  In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment bank or investment banks and manager   or managers (each an  Underwriter ) that will administer the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority   in principal amount of the Registrable Securities included in such offering.      

11   ACTIVE 215355635v.8   4. Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer.  (a)  The Staff has taken the position that any   broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities   that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a  Participating   Broker-Dealer ) may be deemed to be an  underwriter  within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a   prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange   Securities.    The Operating Partnership and the Guarantors understand that it is the Staff s position that if the Prospectus   contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the   above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without   naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such   Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available to   purchasers) to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of   Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the   Securities Act.    (b) In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Operating   Partnership and the Guarantors, upon request, agree to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the   Exchange Offer Registration Statement for a period of up to 180 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period   may be extended pursuant to Section 3(d) hereof), in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange   Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above.    The Operating Partnership and the Guarantors further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized to   deliver such Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available) during such period in connection with   the resales contemplated by this Section 4.   (c) The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Operating Partnership, any Guarantor or any   Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof.    5. Indemnification and Contribution.  (a)  The Operating Partnership and each Guarantor, jointly and   severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder, their respective affiliates,   directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning   of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims,   damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection   with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue   statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state   therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not   misleading, or (2) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus,   any Free Writing Prospectus or any  issuer information  ( Issuer Information ) filed or required to be filed pursuant   to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact   necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not   misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue   statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Initial   Purchaser or information relating to any Holder furnished to the Operating Partnership in writing through J.P.   Morgan.  In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Operating Partnership and the   Guarantors, jointly and severally, will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers and similar   securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their respective affiliates and each Person who   controls such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as   provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration   Statement, any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information.   (b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Operating   Partnership, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, the managers and the directors of   the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors, as applicable, each officer who signed the Registration Statement on   behalf of the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors, and each Person, if any, who controls the Operating   Partnership, the Guarantors, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of   the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a)      

12   ACTIVE 215355635v.8   above, but only with reference to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities caused by any untrue statement or   omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to such Holder furnished to the   Operating Partnership in writing by or on behalf of such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement, any   Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus.   (c) If any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any   Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person   (the  Indemnified Person ) shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the    Indemnifying Person ) in writing, provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from   any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced   (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided, further, that the failure to notify   the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than   under paragraph (a) or (b) above.  If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and   it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably   satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification   pursuant to this Section 5 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and   disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall   have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such   Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the   retention of such counsel; or (ii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include   both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel   would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood and agreed that   the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction,   be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all   Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Any such   separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial   Purchaser shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan, (y) for any Holder, its directors and officers and any control   Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be   designated in writing by the Operating Partnership.  The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement   of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment   for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or   liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an   Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and   expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of   any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after   receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the   Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No Indemnifying Person   shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened   proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have   been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of   such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not   include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any   Indemnified Person.   (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an   Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then   each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall   contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or   liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Operating Partnership   and the Guarantors from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the   Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or   (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to   reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Operating Partnership   and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that   resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The   relative fault of the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other, shall      

13   ACTIVE 215355635v.8   be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact   or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Operating   Partnership and the Guarantors or by the Holders and the parties  relative intent, knowledge, access to information   and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.   (e) The Operating Partnership, the Guarantors and the Holders agree that it would not be just and   equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were   treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the   equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above.  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person   as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to   include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such   Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the   provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount   by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any   damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or   omission or alleged omission.  No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of   Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such   fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Holders  obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5 are several and not   joint.   (f) The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or   remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.   (g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and   in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on   behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or   on behalf of the Operating Partnership or the Guarantors or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the   Operating Partnership or the Guarantors, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of   Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.   6. General.    (a) No Inconsistent Agreements.   The Operating Partnership and the Guarantors represent, warrant   and agree that (i) the rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent   with the rights granted to the holders of any other outstanding securities issued or guaranteed by the Operating   Partnership or any Guarantor under any other agreement and (ii) neither the Operating Partnership nor any   Guarantor has entered into, or on or after the date of this Agreement will enter into, any agreement that is   inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts   with the provisions hereof.   (b) Amendments and Waivers.   The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this   sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the   provisions hereof may not be given unless the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors have obtained the written   consent of Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Registrable Securities   affected by such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent; provided that no amendment,   modification, supplement, waiver or consent to any departure from the provisions of Section 5 hereof shall be   effective as against any Holder of Registrable Securities unless consented to in writing by such Holder.  Any   amendments, modifications, supplements, waivers or consents pursuant to this Section 6(b) shall be by a writing   executed by each of the parties hereto.   (c) Notices.  All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made   in writing by hand-delivery, registered first-class mail, telecopier, or any courier guaranteeing overnight delivery (i)   if to a Holder, at the most current address given by such Holder to the Operating Partnership by means of a notice   given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(c), which address initially is, with respect to the Initial   Purchasers, the address set forth in the Purchase Agreement; (ii) if to the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors,   initially at the Operating Partnership s address set forth in the Purchase Agreement and thereafter at such other      

14   ACTIVE 215355635v.8   address, notice of which is given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(c); and (iii) to such other   persons at their respective addresses as provided in the Purchase Agreement and thereafter at such other address,   notice of which is given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(c).  All such notices and   communications shall be deemed to have been duly given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered;   five Business Days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when receipt is acknowledged, if   telecopied; and on the next Business Day if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery.    Copies of all such notices, demands or other communications shall be concurrently delivered by the Person giving   the same to the Trustee, at the address specified in the Indenture.    (d) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the   successors, assigns and transferees of each of the parties, including, without limitation and without the need for an   express assignment, subsequent Holders; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit any assignment,   transfer or other disposition of Registrable Securities in violation of the terms of the Purchase Agreement or the   Indenture.  If any transferee of any Holder shall acquire Registrable Securities in any manner, whether by operation   of law or otherwise, such Registrable Securities shall be held subject to all the terms of this Agreement, and by   taking and holding such Registrable Securities such Person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound   by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and such Person shall be entitled to receive the   benefits hereof.  The Initial Purchasers (in their capacity as Initial Purchasers) shall have no liability or obligation to   the Operating Partnership or the Guarantors with respect to any failure by a Holder to comply with, or any breach by   any Holder of, any of the obligations of such Holder under this Agreement.    (e) Third Party Beneficiaries.  Each Holder shall be a third party beneficiary to the agreements made   hereunder between the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the   other hand, and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent it deems such enforcement   necessary or advisable to protect its rights or the rights of other Holders hereunder.    (f) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties   hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which   taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.    (g) Headings.  The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, are not a part of   this Agreement and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.    (h) Governing Law.  This Agreement, and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or related   to this Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.    (j) Entire Agreement; Severability.  This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the   parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all oral statements and prior writings with respect thereto.    If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent   jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable or against public policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions,   covenants and restrictions contained herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,   impaired or invalidated.  The Operating Partnership, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers shall endeavor in   good faith negotiations to replace the invalid, void or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic   effect of which  comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, void or unenforceable provisions.
