(1) 
    Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
     (a) Description of Business 
  Heritage Financial Corporation ("Heritage" or the  Company ) is a bank holding company that was incorporated in the State of Washington in August 1997. The Company is primarily engaged in the business of planning, directing and coordinating the business activities of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Heritage Bank (the  Bank ). The Bank is a Washington-chartered commercial bank and its deposits are insured by the FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Bank is headquartered in Olympia, Washington and conducts business from its   63   branch offices located throughout Washington State and the greater Portland, Oregon area. The Bank s business consists primarily of commercial lending and deposit relationships with small businesses and their owners in its market areas and attracting deposits from the general public. The Bank also makes real estate construction and land development loans and consumer loans and originates first mortgage loans on residential properties primarily located in its market area. 
  The Company has expanded its footprint through mergers and acquisitions.  The largest of these transactions was the strategic merger with Washington Banking Company ( Washington Banking ) and its wholly owned subsidiary bank, Whidbey Island Bank ("Whidbey").  Effective May 1, 2014, Washington Banking merged with and into Heritage and Whidbey merged with and into Heritage Bank and this transaction is referred to herein as the "Washington Banking Merger".  In connection with the Washington Banking Merger, Heritage also acquired as a subsidiary the Washington Banking Master Trust, a Delaware statutory business trust.  Pursuant to the merger agreement, Heritage assumed the performance and observance of the covenants to be performed by Washington Banking under an indenture relating to   $25.0 million   in trust preferred securities issued in 2007 and the due and punctual payment of the principal of and premium and interest on such trust preferred securities.  For additional information, see Note (8) Junior Subordinated Debentures.    
  (b) Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. It is recommended that these unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes be read with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (   2015   Annual Form 10-K ). In management's opinion, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . In preparing the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures.  Management believes that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate based on the facts and circumstances at the time.  Actual results, however, could differ from those estimates.  
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation.  The Company reclassified $56.6 million of loans receivable previously classified as owner-occupied commercial real estate at December 31, 2015 to non-owner occupied commercial real estate for all comparative tables in Note (3) Loans Receivable.   The related allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses for all historical periods in Note (4) Allowance for Loan Losses were also reclassified.  None of these loans were considered impaired at   September 30, 2016   or December 31, 2015.  The reclassification was due to a review of certain loan products, including hotels, assisted-living housing and self-storage units, for which the Bank determined the risk characteristics were more akin to non-owner occupied loans.  The Company also reclassified   $179.0 million   fair value (  $179.8 million   amortized cost) of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations previously classified as residential to commercial based on a detailed review of the investment types.  The reclassifications had no effect on prior periods' net income or stockholders  equity. 
  (c) Significant Accounting Policies 
  The significant accounting policies used in preparation of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are disclosed in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have not been any material changes in the Company's significant accounting policies from those contained in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(d) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU" or "Update") 2014-09  ,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , was issued in May 2014.  Under this Update, FASB created a new Topic 606 which is in response to a joint initiative of FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and international financial reporting standards that would:  
             
    Remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements.  
                
    Provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues.  
                
    Improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets.  
                
    Provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements.  
                
    Simplify the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer.  
     The original effective date for this Update was deferred in FASB ASU 2015-14 below.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the Update will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  FASB ASU 2015-14  ,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , was issued in August 2015 and defers the effective date of the above-mentioned FASB ASU 2014-09 for certain entities.  Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is now permitted, but only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  The Company is a public business entity and will not early adopt the guidance in Update 2014-09 as permitted in this Update.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that Update 2014-09 will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption. 
  FASB ASU 2015-16  ,   Business Combinations (Topic 805)  , was issued in September 2015.  Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, the Update requires that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  In addition, an entity is required to present separately on the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The Update did not have an impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  FASB ASU 2016-01  ,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Subtopic 825-10)  , was issued in January 2016, to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information.  This Update contains several provisions, including but not limited to 1) requiring equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; 2) simplifying the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; 3) eliminating the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value; and 4) requiring separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.  The Update also changes certain financial statement disclosure requirements, including requiring disclosures of the fair value of financial instruments be made on the basis of exit price.  The Update is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the Update will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  FASB ASU 2016-02  ,   Leases (Topic 842)  , was issued in February 2016, to increase transparency and comparability of leases among organizations and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements.  The Update sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors.  The Update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either a finance or operating lease.  This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.  All cash payments  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

will be classified within operating activities in the statement of cash flows.  In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.  The Update is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the Update will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
    FASB ASU 2016-08  ,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers:  Principal versus Agent Considerations  , was issued in March 2016 and it clarifies the implementation guidance of the above-mentioned FASB ASU 2014-09 as it relates to principal versus agent considerations.  The Update addresses identifying the unit of account and nature of the goods or services as well as applying the control principle and interactions with the control principle.  The amendments to the Update do not change the core principle of the guidance.  The effective date and transition requirements for this Update are the same as FASB ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the Update will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
    FASB ASU 2016-09  ,   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  , issued in March 2016, is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions.  For public business entities, the guidance is effective for annual periods after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted. Certain amendments will be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. Other amendments will be applied retroactively (such as presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows) or prospectively (such as recognition of excess tax benefits on the income statement).  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this Update will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
    FASB ASU 2016-10  ,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , was issued in April 2016 which clarifies the implementation guidance of the above-mentioned FASB ASU 2014-09 as it relates to identifying performance obligations and licensing.  The effective date and transition requirements for this Update are the same as FASB ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this Update will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
    FASB ASU 2016-12  ,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , was issued in May 2016.  The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606.  Rather, the amendments in this Update affect only the narrow aspects of Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for this Update are the same as FASB ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this Update will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
    FASB ASU 2016-13  ,   Financial Instruments:  Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  , was issued in June 2016.  Commonly referred to as the current expected credit loss model("CECL"), this Update requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount.  The amendment affects loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial asset not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash.  The Update replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology, which generally only considered past events and current conditions, with a methodology that reflects the expected credit losses and required consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to estimate all expected credit losses.  The Update additionally addresses purchased assets and introduces the purchased financial asset with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination ("PCD"). The accounting for these PCD assets is similar to the existing accounting guidance of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 310-30,   Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality  , for purchased credit impaired ("PCI") assets, except the subsequent improvements in estimated cash flows will be immediately recognized into income, similar to the immediate recognition of subsequent deteriorations in cash flows.  Current guidance only allows for the prospective recognition of these cash flow improvements.  Because the terminology has been changed to a "more-than-insignificant" amount of credit deterioration, the presumption is that more assets might qualify for this accounting under the Update than those under current guidance.  For public business entities, the Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted for fiscal years after December 15, 2018.  An entity will apply the amendments through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained  
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted.  A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities.  An entity that has previously applied the guidance of ASC 310-30 will prospectively apply the guidance in this Update for PCD assets.  A prospective transition approach should be used for PCD assets where upon adoption, the amortized cost basis should be adjusted to reflect the addition of the allowance for credit losses. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this Update will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
    FASB ASU 2016-15  ,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 213):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , was issued in August 2016.  The Update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  For public business entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted and must be applied using a retrospective transitional method to each period presented.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this Update will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Investment Securities 
     The Company s investment policy is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity, generate a favorable return on assets without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and complement the Bank s lending activities. Securities are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity when acquired.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company transferred all of its investment securities previously classified as held to maturity to available for sale.  As a result of the transfer and subsequent sales, the Company believes its held to maturity classification process has been compromised and careful evaluation and analysis will be required going forward in determining when circumstances are suitable for management to assert with a sufficient degree of credibility that it has the intent and ability to hold investments to maturity.

(b) Unrealized Losses and Other-Than-Temporary Impairments 
  The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company's investment securities available for sale that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in continuous unrealized loss positions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

(1)    U.S. Government-sponsored agencies. 
  The Company has evaluated these investment securities available for sale as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and has determined that the decline in their value is temporary. The unrealized losses are primarily due to increases in market interest rates. The fair value of these securities is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date.  None of the underlying bonds of the municipal securities had credit ratings that were below investment grade levels at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  The Company has the ability and intent to hold the investments until recovery of the securities' amortized cost which may be the maturity date of the securities. 
  All of the other-than-temporary impairment experienced by the Company in historical periods has been related to its portfolio of private-residential collateralized mortgage obligations.  As there were no private-residential collateralized mortgage obligations at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not perform an other-than-temporary impairment analysis for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   on these securities.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , there were   no   investment securities held to maturity determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired and the Company recorded   no   unrealized losses for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   in earnings or other comprehensive income.  To analyze the unrealized losses, the Company estimated expected future cash flows of the investments by estimating the expected future cash flows of the underlying collateral and applying those collateral cash flows, together with any credit enhancements such as subordinated interests owned by third parties, to the security.  The expected future cash flows of the underlying collateral were determined using the remaining contractual cash flows adjusted for future expected credit losses (which considers  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

current delinquencies and nonperforming assets, future expected default rates and collateral value by vintage and geographic region) and prepayments. The expected cash flows of the security were then discounted at the interest rate used to recognize interest income on the security to arrive at a present value amount. The Company did not use any impairment assumptions as of   September 30, 2015   as the unrealized losses were insignificant.  
    
  (c) Pledged Securities 
  The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities available for sale that are pledged as collateral for the following obligations at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

    Loans Receivable 
     The Company originates loans in the ordinary course of business and has also acquired loans through FDIC-assisted and open bank transactions.  Loans acquired in a business combination may be further classified as  purchased  loans. Loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that not all contractually required payments will be collected are accounted for under FASB ASC310-30. These loans are identified as PCI, or purchased credit impaired loans. Loans purchased that are not accounted for under FASB ASC 310-30 are accounted for under FASB ASC 310-20,   Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs,   and are referred to as "non-PCI" loans.   
  Disclosures related to the Company's recorded investment in loans receivable generally exclude accrued interest receivable and net deferred loan origination fees and costs because they are insignificant.   
  (a) Loan Origination/Risk Management 
  The Company categorizes loans in one of the   four   segments of the total loan portfolio: commercial business, one-to-four family residential, real estate construction and land development and consumer. Within these segments are classes of loans for which management monitors and assesses credit risk in the loan portfolios. The Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies, and nonperforming and potential problem loans. The Company also conducts internal loan reviews and validates the credit risk assessment on a periodic basis and presents the results of these reviews to management. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by loan officers and credit personnel, as well as the Company s policies and procedures. 
  A discussion of the risk characteristics of each loan portfolio segment is as follows: 
  Commercial Business  : 
  There are three significant classes of loans in the commercial portfolio segment: commercial and industrial loans, owner-occupied commercial real estate and non-owner occupied commercial real estate. The owner and non-owner occupied commercial real estate are both considered commercial real estate loans. As the commercial and industrial loans carry different risk characteristics than the commercial real estate loans, they are discussed separately below. 
  Commercial and industrial.   Commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may include a personal guarantee; however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. 
  Commercial real estate.   The Company originates commercial real estate loans within its primary market areas. These loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans, in addition to those of real estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate involves more risk than other classes of loans in that the lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and payments on loans secured by real estate properties are dependent on successful operation and management of the properties. Repayment of these loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate market or the economy. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are generally of lower credit risk than non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans as the borrowers' businesses are likely dependent on the properties.   
  One-to-Four Family Residential  : 
  The majority of the Company s one-to-four family residential loans are secured by single-family residences located in its primary market areas. The Company s underwriting standards require that single-family portfolio loans generally are owner-occupied and do not exceed   80%   of the lower of appraised value at origination or cost of the underlying collateral. Terms of maturity typically range from   15   to   30   years. Historically, the Company sold most single-family loans in the secondary market and retained a smaller portion in its loan portfolio.  From the second quarter of 2013 until May 1, 2014, the Company only originated single-family loans for its loan portfolio. As a result of the Washington Banking Merger, since May 1, 2014 the Company has been originating and selling a majority of its single-family mortgages. 
  Real Estate Construction and Land Development  : 
  The Company originates construction loans for one-to-four family residential and for five or more family residential and commercial properties. The one-to-four family residential construction loans generally include construction of custom homes whereby the home buyer is the borrower. The Company also provides financing to builders for the construction of pre-sold homes and, in selected cases, to builders for the construction of speculative residential property. Substantially all construction loans are short-term in nature and priced with variable rates of interest. Construction lending can involve a higher level of risk than other types of lending because funds are advanced partially based upon the value of the project, which is uncertain prior to the project s completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs as well as the market value of a completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, the Company s estimates with regard to the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio may vary from actual results. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or refinance the indebtedness. If the Company s estimate of the value of a project at completion proves to be overstated, it may have inadequate security for repayment of the loan and may incur a loss if the borrower does not repay the loan. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being dependent upon successful completion of the construction project, interest rate changes, government regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing. 
  Consumer  : 
  The Company originates consumer loans and lines of credit that are both secured and unsecured. The underwriting process for these loans ensures a qualifying primary and secondary source of repayment. Underwriting standards for home equity loans are significantly influenced by statutory requirements, which include, but are not limited to, a maximum loan-to-value percentage of   80%  , collection remedies, the number of such loans a borrower can have at one time and documentation requirements. To monitor and manage consumer loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed. The majority of consumer loans are for relatively small amounts disbursed among many individual borrowers which reduces the credit risk for this type of loan.  To further reduce the risk, trend reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis. 
  As a result of the Washington Banking Merger, the Company is originating indirect consumer loans.  These loans are for new and used automobile and recreational vehicles that are originated indirectly by selected dealers located in the Company's market areas.  The Company has limited its purchase of indirect loans primarily to dealerships that are established and well known in their market areas and to applicants that are not classified as sub-prime.

     Table of Contents  

Loans receivable at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following portfolio segments and classes: 

(b) Concentrations of Credit 
  Most of the Company s lending activity occurs within Washington State, and to a lesser extent Oregon. The Company s primary market areas are concentrated along the I-5 corridor from Whatcom County to Clark County in Washington State and Multnomah County in Oregon, as well as other contiguous markets.  The majority of the Company s loan portfolio consists of, in order of balances at   September 30, 2016  , non-owner occupied commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   concentrations of loans related to any single industry in excess of   10%   of the Company s total loans. 
  (c) Credit Quality Indicators 
  As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to (i) the risk grade of the loans, (ii) the level of classified loans, (iii) net charge-offs, (iv) nonperforming loans, and (v) the general economic conditions of the United States of America, and specifically the states of Washington and Oregon. The Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a risk grade to each of its loans. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 10.  A description of the general characteristics of the risk grades is as follows: 
             
    Grades 1 to 5:   These grades are considered  pass grade  and include loans with negligible to above average but acceptable risk. These borrowers generally have strong to acceptable capital levels and consistent earnings and debt service capacity. Loans with the higher grades within the  pass  category may include borrowers who are experiencing unusual operating difficulties, but have acceptable payment performance to date. Increased monitoring of financial information and/or collateral may be appropriate. Loans with this grade show no immediate loss exposure. 
                
    Grade 6:   This grade includes "Watch" loans and is considered a  pass grade .  The grade is intended to be utilized on a temporary basis for pass grade borrowers where a potentially significant risk-modifying action is anticipated in the near term. 
                
    Grade 7:   This grade includes  Other Assets Especially Mentioned  ( OAEM ) loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines, and is intended to highlight loans with elevated risks. Loans with this grade show signs of deteriorating profits and capital, and the borrower might not be strong enough to sustain a major setback. The borrower is typically higher than normally leveraged, and outside support might  
     
   18 

     Table of Contents  

be modest and likely illiquid. The loan is at risk of further decline unless active measures are taken to correct the situation. 
             
    Grade 8:   This grade includes  Substandard  loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines, which the Company has determined have a high credit risk. These loans also have well-defined weaknesses which make payment default or principal exposure likely, but not yet certain. The borrower may have shown serious negative trends in financial ratios and performance. Such loans may be dependent upon collateral liquidation, a secondary source of repayment or an event outside of the normal course of business. Loans with this grade can be placed on accrual or nonaccrual status based on the Company s accrual policy. 
                
    Grade 9:   This grade includes  Doubtful  loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines, and the Company has determined these loans to have excessive credit risk. Such loans are placed on nonaccrual status and may be dependent upon collateral having a value that is difficult to determine or upon some near-term event which lacks certainty. Additionally, these loans generally have a specific valuation allowance or have been partially charged-off for the amount considered uncollectible. 
                
    Grade 10:   This grade includes  Loss  loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines, and the Company has determined these loans have the highest risk of loss. Such loans are charged-off or charged-down when payment is acknowledged to be uncertain or when the timing or value of payments cannot be determined.  Loss  is not intended to imply that the loan or some portion of it will never be paid, nor does it in any way imply that there has been a forgiveness of debt. 
     Numerical loan grades for loans are established at the origination of the loan.  Loan grades are reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if necessary, by the credit department.  The Bank follows the FDIC s Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy for subsequent classification in the event of payment delinquencies or default.  Typically, an individual loan grade will not be changed from the prior period unless there is a specific indication of credit deterioration or improvement. Credit deterioration is evidenced by delinquency, direct communications with the borrower, or other borrower information that becomes known to management. Credit improvements are evidenced by known facts regarding the borrower or the collateral property. 
  The loan grades relate to the likelihood of losses in that the higher the grade, the greater the loss potential. Loans with a pass grade may have some estimated inherent losses, but to a lesser extent than the other loan grades.  The OAEM loan grade is transitory in that the Company is waiting on additional information to determine the likelihood and extent of the potential loss. The likelihood of loss for OAEM graded loans, however, is greater than Watch graded loans because there has been measurable credit deterioration. Loans with a Substandard grade are generally loans for which the Company has individually analyzed for potential impairment. For Doubtful and Loss graded loans, the Company is almost certain of the losses, and the outstanding principal balances are generally charged-off to the realizable value.

     Table of Contents  

The following tables present the balance of the loans receivable by credit quality indicator as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Potential problem loans are loans classified as OAEM or worse that are currently accruing interest and are not considered impaired, but which management is monitoring because the financial information of the borrower causes concern as to their ability to meet their loan repayment terms.  Potential problem loans may include PCI loans as these loans continue to accrete loan discounts established at acquisition based on the guidance of FASB ASC 310-30.  Potential problem loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $101.0 million   and   $110.4 million  , respectively. The balance of potential problem loans guaranteed by a governmental agency, which guarantee reduces the Company's credit exposure, was   $2.2 million   and   $3.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

(d) Nonaccrual Loans 
  Nonaccrual loans, segregated by segments and classes of loans, were as follows as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The Company had   $3.0 million   and   $1.3 million   of nonaccrual loans guaranteed by governmental agencies at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  PCI loans are not included in the nonaccrual loan table above because these loans are accounted for under FASB ASC 310-30, which provides that accretable yield is calculated based on a loan's expected cash flow even if the loan is not performing under its contractual terms. 
  (e) Past due loans 
  The Company performs an aging analysis of past due loans using the categories of 30-89 days past due and 90 or more days past due. This policy is consistent with regulatory reporting requirements.  
  The balances of past due loans, segregated by segments and classes of loans, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

21 

     Table of Contents  

There were   no   loans 90 days or more past due that were still accruing interest as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  , excluding PCI loans. 
    
  (f) Impaired loans 
    Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans and performing troubled debt restructured ("TDR") loans. The balances of impaired loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are set forth in the following tables. 

22 

     Table of Contents  

The Company had governmental guarantees of   $3.7 million   and   $1.8 million   related to the impaired loan balances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  The average recorded investment of impaired loans for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   are set forth in the following table. 

For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  ,   no   interest income was recognized subsequent to a loan s classification as nonaccrual.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

Bank recorded   $156,000   and   $501,000  , respectively, of interest income related to performing TDR loans.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Bank recorded   $278,000   and   $905,000  , respectively, of interest income related to performing TDR loans.  
  (g) Troubled Debt Restructured Loans 
  A TDR loan is a restructuring in which the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. TDRs are considered impaired and are separately measured for impairment under FASB ASC 310-10-35, whether on accrual ("performing") or nonaccrual ("nonperforming") status.  The Company has more stringent definitions of concessions and impairment measures for PCI loans as these loans have known credit deterioration and are generally accreting income at a lower discounted rate as compared to the contractual note rate based on the guidance of FASB ASC 310-30.  
  The majority of the Bank s TDR loans are a result of granting extensions of maturity on troubled credits which have already been adversely classified. The Bank grants such extensions to reassess the borrower s financial status and to develop a plan for repayment.  The second most prevalent concessions are certain modifications with extensions that also include interest rate reductions. Certain TDRs were additionally re-amortized over a longer period of time. These modifications would all be considered a concession for a borrower that could not obtain similar financing terms from another source other than from the Bank. 
  The financial effects of each modification will vary based on the specific restructure. For the majority of the Bank s TDRs, the loans were interest-only with a balloon payment at maturity. If the interest rate is not adjusted and the modified terms are consistent with other similar credits being offered, the Bank may not experience any loss associated with the restructure. If, however, the restructure involves forbearance agreements or interest rate modifications, the Bank may not collect all the principal and interest based on the original contractual terms. The Bank estimates the necessary allowance for loan losses on TDRs using the same guidance as used for other impaired loans. 
  The recorded investment balance and related allowance for loan losses of performing and nonaccrual TDR   loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

The unfunded commitment to borrowers related to TDRs was   $269,000   and   $551,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  
   24 

     Table of Contents  

Loans that were modified as TDRs during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   are set forth in the following tables: 

(1) 
    Number of contracts and outstanding principal balance represent loans which have balances as of period end as certain loans may have been paid-down or charged-off during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
              (2) 
    Includes subsequent payments after modifications and reflects the balance as of period end.  As the Bank did not forgive any principal or interest balance as part of the loan modification, the Bank s recorded investment in each loan at the date of modification (pre-modification) did not change as a result of the modification (post-modification). 
     Of the   19   loans modified during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   eight   loans with a total outstanding principal balance of   $1.4 million   had no prior modifications.  Of the   30   loans modified during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   15   loans with a total outstanding principal balance of   $1.7 million   had no prior modifications.  Of the   15   loans modified during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,   six   loans with a total outstanding principal balance of   $2.3 million   had no prior modifications.  Of the   51   loans modified during the   nine months ended September  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

30, 2015  ,   27   loans with a total outstanding principal balance of   $8.8 million   had no prior modifications.  The remaining loans included in the tables above for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were previously reported as TDRs.  The Bank typically grants shorter extension periods to continually monitor these troubled credits despite that the extended date may not be when cash flows from these troubled credits are expected. The Company does not consider these modifications a subsequent default of a TDR as new loan terms, specifically new maturity dates, were granted. The potential losses related to these loans would have been considered in the period the loan was first reported as a TDR and adjusted, as necessary, in the current period based on more recent information.  The related specific valuation allowance at   September 30, 2016   was   $639,000   for loans that were modified as TDRs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  There were   no   loans that were modified during the previous twelve months that subsequently defaulted during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  There was   one   commercial and industrial loan totaling   $98,000   at   September 30, 2015   that was modified during the previous twelve months that subsequently defaulted during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   because the borrower was 90 days delinquent on his scheduled payment.  There was one commercial and industrial loan of $1.8 million at September 30, 2015 that was modified during the previous twelve months and subsequently defaulted during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 because the borrower did not make the specific curtailment payments on the loan in prior periods, but for which the required payment was made during the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

(h) Purchased Credit Impaired Loans 
  The Company acquired loans and designated them as PCI loans, which are accounted for under FASB ASC 310-30, in the Washington Banking Merger on May 1, 2014 and in previously completed acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Northwest Commercial Bank ("NCB") on January 9, 2013 and Valley Community Bancshares, Inc. ("Valley") on July 15, 2013 and the FDIC-assisted acquisitions of Cowlitz Bank ("Cowlitz") and Pierce Commercial Bank ("Pierce") on July 30, 2010 and November 8, 2010, respectively. 
  The following table reflects the outstanding principal balance and recorded investment of the PCI loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

26 

     Table of Contents  

On the acquisition dates, the amount by which the undiscounted expected cash flows of the PCI loans exceeded the estimated fair value of the loan is the  accretable yield.   The accretable yield is then measured at each financial reporting date and represents the difference between the remaining undiscounted expected cash flows and the current carrying value of the PCI loans. 
  The following table summarizes the accretable yield on the PCI loans for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

(4) 
    Allowance for Loan Losses  
     The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. The methodology for calculating the allowance for loan losses is completed on loans originated by the Bank and on loans purchased in mergers and acquisitions. The FDIC shared-loss agreements for loans purchased in mergers and acquisitions were terminated on August 4, 2015. Prior to their termination, when a credit deterioration occurred, subsequent to the acquisition, on a loan that was covered by the FDIC shared-loss agreements, a provision for loan losses was charged to earnings for the full amount of the impairment, without regard to the coverage of the FDIC shared-loss agreements.

At   September 30, 2016  , the recorded investment of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process was   $576,000  .

    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
     (a) Goodwill 
  The Company s goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in the Washington Banking Merger on May 1, 2014, and the acquisitions of Valley on July 15, 2013, Western Washington Bancorp in 2006 and North Pacific Bank in 1998. The Company s goodwill is assigned to the Bank and is evaluated for impairment at the Bank level (reporting unit). 
  There were   no   additions to goodwill during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s step-one analysis concluded that the reporting unit s fair value was greater than its carrying value and therefore   no   goodwill impairment charges were required, or recorded, for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Similarly,   no   goodwill impairment charges were required, or recorded, for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Even though there was   no   goodwill impairment at   September 30, 2016  , adverse events may impact the recoverability of goodwill and could result in a future impairment charge which could have a material impact on the Company s operating results. 
  b) Other Intangible Assets 
  The other intangible assets represent the core deposit intangible ("CDI") acquired in business combinations. The useful life of the CDI related to the Washington Banking Merger, the acquisitions of Valley, NCB, Pierce, Cowlitz, and Western Washington Bancorp were estimated to be   ten  ,   ten  ,   five  ,   four  ,   nine   and   eight years  , respectively.  
  The following table presents the change in the other intangible assets for the periods indicated:

    Other Borrowings 
     (a) Federal Home Loan Bank Advances 
  The Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of Des Moines functions as a member-owned cooperative providing credit for member financial institutions.  Advances are made pursuant to several different programs.  Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities.  Limitations on the amount of advances are based on a percentage of the Bank's assets or on the FHLB s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank maintained a credit facility with the FHLB of Des Moines for   $664.5 million   and had   $17.7 million   of FHLB advances outstanding at a weighted average rate of   0.45%  .  At   December 31, 2015   there were   no   FHLB advances

     Table of Contents  

outstanding. 
  The following table sets forth the details of FHLB advances during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Advances from the FHLB are collateralized by a blanket pledge on FHLB stock owned by the Bank, deposits at the FHLB, certain one-to-four single family residential loans, investment securities which are obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or other assets.  In accordance with the pledge agreement, the Company must maintain unencumbered collateral in an amount equal to varying percentages ranging from   100%   to   160%   of outstanding advances depending on the type of collateral.  
    
  (b) Federal Funds Purchased 
    
  The Bank maintains advance lines with Wells Fargo Bank, US Bank, TIB and Pacific Coast Bankers  Bank to purchase federal funds of up to   $90.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . The lines generally mature annually or are reviewed annually.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   federal funds purchased. 
    
  (c) Credit facilities 
    
  The Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for   $51.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , of which there were   no   borrowings outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . Any advances on the credit facility would have to be first secured by the Bank's investment securities or loans receivable. 

(8) 
    Junior Subordinated Debentures 
     As part of the Washington Banking Merger, the Company assumed trust preferred securities and junior subordinated debentures with a total fair value of   $18.9 million   at the May 1, 2014 merger date. 
    Washington Banking Master Trust ("Trust"), a Delaware statutory business trust, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Washington Banking created for the exclusive purposes of issuing and selling capital securities and utilizing sale proceeds to acquire junior subordinated debt issued by Washington Banking.  During 2007, the Trust issued   $25.0 million   of trust preferred securities with a   30  -year maturity, callable after the fifth year by Washington Banking.  The trust preferred securities have a quarterly adjustable rate based upon the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus   1.56%  .  On the Washington Banking Merger date of May 1, 2014, the Company acquired the Trust, which retained the Washington Banking Master Trust name, and assumed the performance and observance of the covenants under the indenture related to the trust preferred securities. 
  The adjustable rate of the trust preferred securities at   September 30, 2016   was   2.41%  .  The weighted average rate of the junior subordinated debentures was   4.49%   and   4.43%   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   4.01%   and   4.36%   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The weighted average rate includes the accretion of the discount established at the merger date which is amortized over the life of the trust preferred securities.   
  The junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets of the Trust, and payments under the junior subordinated debentures are the sole revenues of the Trust.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the balance of the junior subordinated debentures, net of unaccreted discount, was   $19.6 million   and   $19.4 million  , respectively.  All of the common securities of the Trust are owned by the Company.   Heritage has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the capital securities along with all obligations of the Trust under the trust agreements.

    Repurchase Agreements 
     The Company utilizes repurchase agreements with   one  -day maturities as a supplement to funding sources. Repurchase agreements are secured by pledged investment securities available for sale.  Under the repurchase agreements, the Company is required to maintain an aggregate market value of securities pledged greater than the balance of the repurchase agreements. The Company is required to pledge additional securities to cover any declines below the balance of the repurchase agreements.  The classes of collateral pledged for the Company's repurchase agreement obligations as of   September 30, 2016   were residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of   $13.9 million  , commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of   $5.6 million   and and U.S. Government-sponsored agencies of   $2.9 million  .  The classes of collateral pledged for the Company's repurchase agreement obligations as of   December 31, 2015  , were residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of   $18.0 million   and commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of   $5.2 million  .  For additional information on the total value of investment securities pledged for repurchase agreements see Note (2) Investment Securities.

    Derivative Financial Instruments 
     The Company has entered into certain interest rate swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments.  The purpose of these derivative contracts is primarily to provide commercial business loan customers the ability to convert their loans from variable to fixed interest rates. Upon the origination of a derivative contract with a customer, the Company simultaneously enters into an offsetting derivative contract with a third party in order to offset its exposure on the variable and fixed rate components of the customer agreement.  The Company recognizes immediate income based upon the difference in the bid/ask spread of the underlying transactions with its customers and the third party.  Because the Company acts only as an intermediary for its customer, subsequent changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts offset each other and do not significantly impact the Company s results of operations. 
  The notional amounts and estimated fair values of interest rate derivative contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are presented in the following table.

  The following table illustrates the reconciliation of weighted average shares used for earnings per common share computations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

Potential dilutive shares are excluded from the computation of earnings per share if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , there were   no   anti-dilutive shares outstanding related to options to acquire common stock.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , anti-dilutive shares outstanding related to options to acquire common stock totaled   580   as the assumed proceeds from exercise price, tax benefits and future compensation were in excess of the market value.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , anti-dilutive shares outstanding related to options to acquire common stock totaled   2,650   and   4,883  , respectively, for the same reasons indicated for the 2016 periods.  
  (b) Dividends 
  The timing and amount of cash dividends paid on the Company's common stock depends on the Company s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other relevant factors. Dividends on common stock from the Company depend substantially upon receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is the Company s predominant source of income.

     Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes the dividend activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and calendar year 2015. 

* Denotes a special dividend. 
  The FDIC and the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions, Division of Banks, as the Bank's primary regulators, have the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company. Additionally, current guidance from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve Board") provides, among other things, that dividends per share on the Company s common stock generally should not exceed earnings per share, measured over the previous four fiscal quarters. Current regulations allow the Company and the Bank to pay dividends on their common stock if the Company s or the Bank s regulatory capital would not be reduced below the statutory minimum capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, respectively. 
  (c) Stock Repurchase Program 
  The Company has had various stock repurchase programs since March 1999. On October 23, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   5%   of the Company's outstanding common shares, or approximately   1,513,000   shares, under the eleventh stock repurchase plan.  The number, timing and price of shares repurchased will depend on business and market conditions, and other factors, including opportunities to deploy the Company's capital.  
    
  The following table provides total repurchased shares and average share prices under the plan for the periods indicated:  

(1) Represents shares repurchased and average price per share paid during the duration of the plan. 
  In addition to the stock repurchases disclosed in the table above, the Company repurchased shares to pay withholding taxes on the vesting of restricted stock.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   5,267   and   29,206     shares of common stock at an average price per share of   $18.64   and   $17.77  , respectively, to pay withholding taxes on the vesting of restricted stock that vested during the respective periods.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company repurchased   388   and   21,998   shares of common stock at an average price per share of   $17.63   and   $17.07  , respectively, to pay withholding taxes on the vesting of restricted stock that vested during the respective periods.

    Stock-Based Compensation 
     Stock options generally vest ratably over   three   years and expire   five   years after they become exercisable or vest ratably over   four   years and expire   ten   years from date of grant. Restricted stock awards issued generally have a   four  -year cliff vesting or   four  -year ratable vesting schedule. The Company issues new shares of common stock to satisfy share option exercises and restricted stock awards.  
  On July 24, 2014, the Company's shareholders approved the Heritage Financial Corporation 2014 Omnibus Equity Plan that provides for the issuance of   1,500,000   shares of the Company's common stock in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards (which includes restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance units, performance shares or bonus shares) and cash incentive awards. 
  Under the Company's stock-based compensation plans,   1,151,503   shares remain available for future issuance as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  (a) Stock Option Awards 
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company did   no  t recognize any compensation expense or related tax benefit related to stock options as all of the compensation expense related to the outstanding stock options had been previously recognized.  The intrinsic value and cash proceeds from options exercised during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $99,000   and   $401,000  , respectively. The intrinsic value and cash proceeds from options exercised during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $223,000   and   $666,000  , respectively.

    Fair Value Measurements 
     Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: 
  Level 1  :  Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active exchange markets, or interest in open-end mutual funds that allow the Company to sell its ownership interest back to the fund at net asset value on a daily basis. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets, liabilities, or funds. 
  Level 2  :  Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in less active dealer, or broker markets, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or valuations using methodologies with observable inputs. 
  Level 3  :  Valuations for assets and liabilities that are derived from other valuation methodologies, such as option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques using unobservable inputs, and not based on market exchange, dealer, or broker traded transactions. Level 3 valuations incorporate certain assumptions and projections in determining the fair value assigned to such assets or liabilities. 
  (a) Recurring and Nonrecurring Basis 
  The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to measure the fair value of certain assets on a recurring and nonrecurring basis: 
  Investment Securities Available for Sale  : 
  The fair values of all investment securities are based upon the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the security. If available, fair values of investment securities are determined by quoted market prices (Level 1). For investment securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices on similar securities (Level 2).  For investment securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated by using observable and unobservable inputs such as discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). Security valuations are obtained from third party pricing services for comparable assets or liabilities. 
  Impaired Loans  : 
  At the time a loan is considered impaired, its impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, observable market price, or fair market value of the collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent. Impaired loans for which impairment is measured using the discounted cash flow approach are not considered to be measured at fair value because the loan s effective interest rate is generally not a fair value input, and for the purposes of fair value disclosures, the fair value of these loans are measured commensurate with non-impaired loans. If the Company utilizes the fair market value of the collateral method, the fair value used to measure impairment is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value based on the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business (Level 3). Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. 
  Other Real Estate Owned  : 
  Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. 
  Appraisals for both collateral-dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned are performed by certified general appraisers for commercial properties or certified residential appraisers for residential properties whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Once received, the Company reviews  
  
   39 

     Table of Contents  

the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics. On a quarterly basis, the Company compares the actual selling price of collateral that has been liquidated to the most recent appraised value to determine what additional adjustment should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value. 
  Derivative Financial Instruments: 
  The Company obtains broker/dealer quotes to value its interest rate derivative contracts, which use valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (Level 2). 
  The following tables summarize the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

There were   no   transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
  The Company may be required to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 
  The tables below represent assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and the net losses (gains) recorded in earnings during   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .

(b) Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  Because broadly traded markets do not exist for most of the Company s financial instruments, the fair value calculations attempt to incorporate the effect of current market conditions at a specific time. These determinations are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and do not include tax ramifications; therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision, substantiated by comparison to independent markets and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the instruments. There may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results. For all of these reasons, the aggregation of the fair value calculations presented herein do not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of the Company. 
  
   42 

     Table of Contents  

The tables below present the carrying value amount of the Company s financial instruments and their corresponding estimated fair values at the dates indicated. 

43 

     Table of Contents  

The methods and assumptions, not previously presented, used to estimate fair value are described as follows: 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents: 
  The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term or reprice frequently and that have little or no risk are considered to have a fair value equal to carrying value (Level 1). 
  Other Interest Earning Deposits: 
  These deposits with other banks have maturities greater than three months.  The fair value is calculated based upon market prices for similar deposits (Level 2). 
  Federal Home Loan Bank Stock  : 
  FHLB stock is not publicly traded; thus, it is not practicable to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.  
  Loans Held for Sale  : 
  The fair value of loans held for sale is estimated based upon binding contracts or quotes from third party investors for similar loans. (Level 2). 
  Loans Receivable  : 
  Except for certain impaired loans discussed previously, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life (Level 3). While these methodologies are permitted under U.S. GAAP, they are not based on the exit price concept of the fair value required under FASB ASC 820-10,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  , and generally produce a higher value. 
  
   44 

     Table of Contents  

Accrued Interest Receivable/Payable  : 
  The fair value of accrued interest receivable/payable balances are determined using inputs and fair value measurements commensurate with the asset or liability from which the accrued interest is generated. The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value (Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3). 
  Deposits  : 
  For deposits with no contractual maturity, the fair value is assumed to equal the carrying value (Level 1). The fair value of fixed maturity deposits is based on discounted cash flows using the difference between the deposit rate and the rates offered by the Company for deposits of similar remaining maturities (Level 2). 
  Federal Home Loan Bank Advances  : 
  The fair value of FHLB advances is estimated based on discounting the future cash flows using the market rate currently offered (Level 2). 
  Securities Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase  : 
  Securities sold under agreement to repurchase are short-term in nature and they reprice on a daily basis. Fair value financial instruments that are short-term or reprice frequently and that have little or no risk are considered to have a fair value equal to carrying value (Level 1). 
  Junior Subordinated Debentures: 
  The fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on current rates for similar types of debt, which many be unobservable, and considering recent trading activity of similar instruments in markets which can be inactive (Level 3). 
  Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments  : 
  The majority of our commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commitments to sell mortgage loans carry current market interest rates if converted to loans. As such, no premium or discount was ascribed to these commitments (Level 1). They are excluded from the preceding tables.

    Commitments and Contingencies 
     In June 2016, the Company received preliminary findings from the Washington State Department of Revenue ("DOR") regarding their business and occupation ("B O") tax audit on the B O tax returns of Whidbey for the years 2010-2014.  The state B O tax is a gross receipts tax and is calculated on the gross income from activities.  It is measured on the value of products, gross proceeds of sale, or gross income of the business. A substantial portion of the preliminary findings related to the receipt of FDIC shared-loss payments from the FDIC to Washington Banking Company in connection with its acquisitions of City Bank in April 2010 and North County Bank in September 2010.  In their preliminary findings, the DOR is considering those payments as taxable for B O tax purposes.  The total amount of this preliminary finding, along with calculated back interest, is approximately   $1.6 million  .  Given the early stages of this DOR audit, management's estimates of the Company's ultimate liability, if any, involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information and an assessment of the validity of facts and calculations assumed by the DOR.  Management does not believe a material loss is probable at this time and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved.  Management believes that it is reasonably possible that future changes to the Company's estimates of loss and the ultimate amount paid for resolution of this B O audit could impact the Company's results of operations in future periods.  Any such losses would be reported as a noninterest expense in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. 

ITEM 2.

Overview 
  Heritage Financial Corporation is a bank holding company, which primarily engages in the business activities of its wholly owned subsidiary, Heritage Bank. We provide financial services to our local communities with an ongoing strategic focus on expanding our commercial lending relationships and market area and a continual focus on asset quality.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had total assets of   $3.85 billion   and total stockholders  equity of   $496.0 million  . The Company s business activities generally are limited to passive investment activities and oversight of its investment in the Bank.  Accordingly, the information set forth in this report relates primarily to the Bank s operations. 
  Our business consists primarily of commercial lending and deposit relationships with small businesses and their owners in our market areas and attracting deposits from the general public. We also originate real estate construction and land development loans, consumer loans and one-to-four family residential loans collateralized by residential properties located in western and central Washington State and the greater Portland, Oregon area. 
  Our core profitability depends primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on interest earning assets, comprised primarily of loans and investment securities, and interest expense, which is the amount we pay on our interest bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. Management strives to match the repricing characteristics of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to protect net interest income from changes in market interest rates and changes in the shape of the yield curve. Like most financial institutions, our net interest income is affected significantly by general and local economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, and by governmental policies and actions of regulatory agencies. Net interest income is additionally affected by changes on the volume and mix of interest earning assets, interest earned on these assets, the volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest paid on these liabilities. 
  Our net income is affected by many factors, including the provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses is dependent on changes in the loan portfolio and management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio as well as prevailing economic and market conditions. The allowance for loan losses reflects the amount that the Company believes is appropriate to provide for probable incurred credit losses in its loan portfolio. 
  Net income is also affected by noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income primarily consists of service charges and other fees, gain on sale of loans (net) and other income. Noninterest expense consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, professional services and other expenses. Compensation and employee benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement and other employee benefits. Occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of lease payments, taxes, depreciation charges, maintenance and costs of utilities. 
  Results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Other income and other expenses are also impacted by growth of operations and growth in the number of loan and deposit accounts through acquisitions and core banking business growth. Growth in operations affects other expenses primarily as a result of additional employees, branch facilities and marketing expense. Growth in the number of loan and deposit accounts affects other income, including service charges and other fees, as well as other expenses such as data processing services, supplies, postage, telecommunications and other miscellaneous expenses. 

Earnings Summary 
    Comparison of quarter ended   September 30, 2016   to the comparable quarter in the prior year 
  Net income was   $11.0 million  , or   $0.37   per diluted common share, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $9.5 million  , or   $0.32   per diluted common share, for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   $1.5 million  , or   16.3%   increase in net income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily the result of a   $1.7 million  , or   5.2%  , increase on net interest income primarily as a result of an increase in interest earning assets, offset partially by a decrease in net interest margin for the respective periods. The net interest margin decreased five basis points to   3.95%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   4.00%   for the same period in   2015  . 
  The efficiency ratio consists of noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income before provision for loan losses plus noninterest income. The Company s efficiency ratio decreased to   61.7%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   65.9%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in the efficiency ratio for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   is attributable primarily to the above mentioned increase in net interest income as well as a   $504,000   decrease in noninterest expense.

Comparison of nine months ended   September 30, 2016   to the comparable period in the prior year 
  Net income was   $29.0 million  ,   or   $0.97   per diluted common share, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $28.0 million  , or   $0.93   per diluted common share, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The   $1.0 million  , or   3.7%   increase in net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was primarily the result of a   $2.4 million  , or   2.4%  , increase in net interest income, primarily as a result of the increase in interest earning assets, offset partially by a decrease in the net interest margin. The net interest margin decreased 17 basis points to   4.00%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   4.17%   for the same period in   2015  . 
  The Company s efficiency ratio decreased to   64.8%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   65.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in the efficiency ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   is attributable primarily to the above mentioned increase in net interest income.  

Net Interest Income 
  One of the Company's key sources of earnings is net interest income.  There are several factors that affect net interest income including, but not limited to, the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities; the volume of noninterest bearing deposits and other liabilities and shareholders' equity; the volume of noninterest earning assets; market interest rate fluctuations; and asset quality.   
  Comparison of quarter ended   September 30, 2016   to the comparable quarter in the prior year 
  Net interest income increased   $1.7 million  , or   5.2%  , to   $33.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $31.9 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The following table provides relevant net interest income information for the dates indicated.

  Interest Income 
  Total interest income increased   $1.6 million  , or   4.9%  , to   $35.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $33.5 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The balance of average interest earning assets increased   $219.6 million  , or   6.9%  , to   $3.38 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $3.16 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and the yield on total interest earning assets decreased seven basis points to   4.13%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   4.20%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Interest income from interest and fees on loans increased   $736,000  , or   2.4%  , to   $30.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $30.2 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase was the result of a   $170.1 million  , or   7.2%  , increase in average loans receivable as a result of loan growth for the same period, offset partially by 21 basis points decrease in the yield on loans to   4.87%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   5.08%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in yield was due primarily to a decrease in the contractual note rates in the loan portfolio and a decrease in incremental accretion income.  Yields on loans, excluding incremental accretion on purchased loans, were 4.62% for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 4.76% for the same period in   2015  .  Yields on loans, excluding incremental accretion on purchase loans, were impacted positively by four basis points during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   due to a $249,000

prepayment penalty recognized during the period.  The effect on loan yields from incremental accretion income decreased eight basis points to   0.25%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   0.33%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  The following table presents the loan yield and effects of the incremental accretion on purchased loans for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

(1)   
    As of the dates of the completion of each of the merger and acquisition transactions, purchased loans were recorded at their estimated fair value, including our estimate of future expected cash flows until the ultimate resolution of these credits.  The difference between the contractual loan balance and the fair value represents the purchased discount.  The purchased discount is modified quarterly as a result of cash flow re-estimation.  The incremental accretion income represents the amount of income recorded on the purchased loans in excess of the contractual stated interest rate in the individual loan notes. 
     Incremental accretion income was   $1.6 million   and   $1.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decrease in the incremental accretion was primarily a result of a decrease in the prepayments of purchased loans, primarily loans from the Washington Banking Merger, during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , and a continued decline in the purchased loan balances.  
  Total interest income increased primarily due to a   $880,000  , or   27.1%  , increase in interest income on investment securities to   $4.1 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $3.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   as a result of both an increase in average balances and an increase in investment yields for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  The average balance of investment securities increased   $88.5 million  , or   12.2%  , to   $814.7 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $726.2 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   due primarily to investment purchases.  Yields on taxable securities increased 30 basis points to   1.95%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   1.65%   for the same period in   2015  .  Yields on nontaxable securities increased nine basis points to   2.17%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   2.08%   for the same period in   2015  .  The Company is actively managing its investment securities portfolio to mitigate declining loan yields. 
  Average other interest earning assets decreased   $39.0 million  , or   47.6%  , to   $42.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $81.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in interest earning deposits as the Bank utilized these assets to fund its loan growth. 
  Interest Expense 
  Total interest expense was   $1.5 million   for both the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased two basis points to   0.25%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   0.27%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Total average interest bearing liabilities increased by   $114.5 million  , or   5.0%  , to   $2.41 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $2.30 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  The cost of interest bearing deposits decreased two basis points to   0.21%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   0.23%   for the same period in   2015  .  Total average interest bearing deposits increased   $110.9 million  , or   4.9%  , to   $2.37 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $2.26 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  The average balance of certificates of deposits decreased   $69.0 million  , or   15.4%  , to   $378.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $447.4 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The cost of certificates of deposits decreased three basis points to   0.49%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   0.52%   for the same period in 2015.  Based on the change in the average balance and cost of the certificates of deposit, the interest expense on certificates of deposit decreased   $118,000  , or   20.1%  , to   $468,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $586,000   for the same period in   2015  .

The decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposits was offset partially by a   $96,000  , or   81.4%  , increase in the cost of savings accounts to   $214,000   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $118,000   for the same period in   2015   due to the combination of a   $82.9 million  , or   19.5%  , increase in the average balance to   $507.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $424.6 million   for the same period in   2015   and an increase of six basis points in the cost of savings accounts to   0.17%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   0.11%   for the same period in   2015  .  
  The average rate of the junior subordinated debentures, including the effects of accretion of the discount established as of the date of the merger with Washington Banking Company, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   4.49%  , an increase of 48 basis points from   4.01%   for the same period in   2015  .  The rate increase on the debentures was due to an increase in the three-month LIBOR rate to 0.85% at September 30, 2016 from 0.33% on September 30, 2015. 
  Net Interest Margin 
  Net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets (net interest margin) for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   decreased five basis points to   3.95%   from   4.00%   for the same period in   2015  .  The net interest spread for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   also decreased five basis points to   3.88%   from   3.93%   for the same period in   2015  .   The decrease is primarily due to the above mentioned decrease in yields on total interest earning assets. 
  Net interest margin is impacted by the incremental accretion on purchased loans. The following table presents the net interest margin and effects of the incremental accretion on purchased loans for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

(1)   
    As of the dates of the completion of each of the merger and acquisition transactions, purchased loans were recorded at their estimated fair value, including our estimate of future expected cash flows until the ultimate resolution of these credits.  The difference between the contractual loan balance and the fair value represents the purchased discount.  The purchased discount is modified quarterly as a result of cash flow re-estimation.  The incremental accretion income represents the amount of income recorded on the purchased loans in excess of the contractual stated interest rate in the individual loan notes. 
     Due to the current low interest rate environment, together with the projected principal reduction in higher yielding purchased loans, the Company expects the net interest margin will continue to experience downward pressure in future periods. 
    
  Comparison of nine months ended   September 30, 2016   to the comparable period in the prior year 
  Net interest income increased   $2.4 million  , or   2.4%  , to   $99.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $97.1 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The following table provides relevant net interest income information for the dates indicated.

  Interest Income 
  Total interest income increased   $2.2 million  , or   2.2%  , to   $103.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $101.7 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The balance of average interest earning assets increased   $208.6 million  , or   6.7%  , to   $3.32 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $3.12 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   The yield on total interest earning assets decreased 19 basis points to   4.18%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   4.37%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   
  Interest income on loans increased   $382,000  , or   0.4%  , to   $91.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $91.2 million   for the same period in   2015   due primarily to a   $166.0 million  , or   7.2%  , increase in the average balance of loans receivable to   $2.46 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.30 billion   for the same period in 2015 as a result of loan growth.  The impact on interest income as a result of the increase in average loan balances was partially offset by a decrease in loan yields, which was the result of a decrease in the contractual loan note rates and a decrease in the effects of incremental accretion income.  Loan yields decreased 34 basis points to   4.97%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   5.31%   for the same period in   2015  .

The following table presents the loan yield and effects of the incremental accretion on purchased loans for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

(1)   
    As of the dates of the completion of each of the merger and acquisition transactions, purchased loans were recorded at their estimated fair value, including our estimate of future expected cash flows until the ultimate resolution of these credits.  The difference between the contractual loan balance and the fair value represents the purchased discount.  The purchased discount is modified quarterly as a result of cash flow re-estimation.  The incremental accretion income represents the amount of income recorded on the purchased loans in excess of the contractual stated interest rate in the individual loan notes. 
     The incremental accretion income was   $6.0 million   and   $8.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The effect on loan yields from incremental accretion income decreased 14 basis points to   0.32%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   0.46%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in the incremental accretion was primarily a result of a decrease in the prepayments of purchased loans, primarily loans from the Washington Banking Merger, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , and a continued decline in the purchased loan balances.  
  Total interest income increased primarily due to the   $1.8 million  , or   17.3%  , increase in interest income on investment securities to   $12.1 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $10.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as a result of both an increase in average balances and an increase in investment yields for the for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  The average balances of taxable and nontaxable securities increased   $64.3 million  , or   8.6%  , to   $814.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $750.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of purchases of investment securities.  The yields on taxable securities increased 16 basis points to   1.92%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   1.76%   for the same period in   2015   and the yields on nontaxable securities increased ten basis points to   2.18%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   2.08%   for the same period in   2015  .  The Company is actively managing its investment securities portfolio to mitigate declining loan yields. 
  Interest Expense 
  Total interest expense decreased by   $148,000  , or   3.2%  , to   $4.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $4.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased two basis points to   0.25%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   0.27%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Total average interest bearing liabilities increased by   $114.1 million  , or   5.0%  , to   $2.38 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $2.27 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Total interest expense on interest bearing deposits decreased   $196,000  , or   4.9%  , to   $3.8 million     during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $4.0 million   the same period in   2015  .  The average total cost of interest bearing deposits decreased two basis points to   0.22%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   0.24%   for the same period in   2015  . 
  The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a   $78.8 million  , or   16.6%  , decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit to   $397.1 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $475.8 million   during the same period in   2015   and a two basis point decrease in the cost on certificates of deposit to   0.50%   from   0.52%   for the same periods.  Based on the change in the average balance and cost of the certificates of deposit, the interest expense on certificates of deposit decreased   $348,000  , or   18.9%  , to   $1.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $1.8 million   for the same period in   2015  . 
  The decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposit was offset by a   $224,000  , or   70.9%  , increase in the cost of savings accounts to   $540,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $316,000   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in the cost of savings accounts during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was due to the combination of a   $87.5 million  , or   22.4%  , increase in the average balance of savings accounts to   $478.8

  The average rate of the junior subordinated debentures, including the effects of accretion of the discount established as of the date of the merger with Washington Banking Company, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   4.43%  , an increase of seven basis points from   4.36%   for the same period in   2015  . 
  Net Interest Margin 
  Net interest margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased 17 basis points to   4.00%   from   4.17%   for the same period in   2015  .  The net interest spread for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased 17 basis points to   3.93%   from   4.10%   for the same period in   2015  .   The decrease is primarily due to the above mentioned decrease in yields on total interest earning assets for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table presents the net interest margins and effects of the incremental accretion on purchased loans for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

(1)   
    As of the dates of the completion of each of the merger and acquisition transactions, purchased loans were recorded at their estimated fair value, including our estimate of future expected cash flows until the ultimate resolution of these credits.  The difference between the contractual loan balance and the fair value represents the purchased discount.  The purchased discount is modified quarterly as a result of cash flow re-estimation.  The incremental accretion income represents the amount of income recorded on the purchased loans in excess of the contractual stated interest rate in the individual loan notes. 

Provision for Loan Losses 
  The Bank has established a comprehensive methodology for determining its allowance for loan losses.  The allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions for loan losses charged to expense, and is reduced by loans charged-off, net of loan recoveries or a recovery of previous provision.  The amount of the provision expense recognized during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was calculated in accordance with the Bank's methodology.  For additional information, see the section entitled "Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses" below. 
  The provision for loan losses is dependent on the Company s ability to manage asset quality and control the level of net charge-offs through prudent underwriting standards. In addition, a decline in general economic conditions could increase future provisions for loan losses and have a material effect on the Company s net income. 
  Comparison of quarter ended   September 30, 2016   to the comparable quarter in the prior year 
  The provision for loan losses increased   $644,000  , or   75.7%   to   $1.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $851,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase in the provision for loan losses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from the same period in   2015   was primarily the result of a change in the volume and mix of loans as well as changes in certain environmental factors, partially offset by improvements in certain historical loss factors.  Based on a thorough review of the loan portfolio, the Bank determined that the provision for loan losses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was appropriate as it was calculated in accordance with the Bank's methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses.  
  Comparison of nine months ended   September 30, 2016   to the comparable period in the prior year 
  The provision for loan losses increased   $507,000  , or   15.6%   to   $3.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $3.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in the provision for loan losses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from the same period in   2015   was primarily the result of a $1.3 million increase in net charge-offs during 2016 in addition to changes in the volume and mix of loans, offset by the decrease in certain historical loss factors as described above.  Based on a thorough review of the loan portfolio, the Bank determined that the provision for loan losses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was appropriate as it was calculated in accordance with the Bank's methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses.

Noninterest Income 
  Comparison of quarter ended   September 30, 2016   to the comparable quarter in the prior year 
  Total noninterest income decreased   $323,000  , or   3.4%  , to   $9.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $9.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . The following table presents the change in the key components of noninterest income for the periods noted. 

Gain on the sale of loans, net increased   $2.0 million  , or   143.4%    for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to a $2.1 million gain on sale of loan as a result of the sale of a previously classified purchased credit impaired loan.  The gain on sale of mortgage loans for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.1 million and $857,000, respectively.  The gain on sale of the government guaranteed portion of certain Small Business Administration ("SBA") loans for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $285,000 and $554,000, respectively.   
  The Bank recorded a   $1.7 million   gain on termination of FDIC shared-loss agreements for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   as the Bank entered into an agreement terminating the shared-loss agreements for all three of the FDIC-assisted acquisitions during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  No similar gain was recorded by the Bank during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Other income increased $57,000, or 2.4%, to $2.5 million for   three months ended September 30, 2016   from $2.4 million for   three months ended September 30, 2015   due primarily to an increase of $619,000 in interest rate swap fee income based on the execution of additional swaps during the period.  The increase in other income was partially offset by a $597,000 decrease in cash payments received on purchased loans previously charged-off prior to commencement of the acquisition or merger dates.

The following table presents the change in the key components of noninterest income for the periods noted. 

Gain on the sale of loans, net increased   $1.6 million  , or   41.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to a $2.1 million gain on sale of loan as a result of the sale of a previously classified purchased credit impaired loan.  The gain on sale of mortgage loans for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 was $2.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively.  The gain on sale of SBA loans for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 was $777,000 and $1.4 million, respectively.  The $647,000, or 45.4%, decrease of net gains on the sale of the government guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans is a result of a decrease in SBA guarantee sales activities due to competitive pressures. 
  The Bank recorded a   $1.7 million   gain on termination of FDIC shared-loss agreements for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as the Bank entered into an agreement terminating the shared-loss agreements for all three of the FDIC-assisted acquisitions during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  No similar gain was recorded by the Bank during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  The gain on sale of Merchant VISA portfolio was   $1.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The gain was a result of the Company's sale of its Merchant Visa portfolio in January 2015. The effects of this sale resulted in lower future Merchant Visa income and a decrease in total noninterest income.  
  Other income increased $852,000, or 15.2%, to $6.5 million for   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from $5.6 million for   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due primarily to an increase of $982,000 in interest rate swap fee income based on the execution of swaps during 2016 and an increase of $317,000 in bank-owned life insurance income as the Bank purchased additional BOLI of $25.0 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 (the impact of which is fully realized in 2016) and $8.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  Other income additionally increased $497,000 as the Bank did not record a change in FDIC indemnification during 2016 as the FDIC shared-loss agreements were terminated during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in other income was partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in cash payments received on purchased loans previously charged-off prior to commencement of the acquisition or merger dates.

Compensation and employee benefits increased   $715,000  , or   4.8%  , to   $15.6 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $14.9 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   is primarily due to the results of increased staffing in the metro markets, including Seattle and Bellevue, Washington and standard salary increases. 
  Data processing decreased   $455,000  , or   19.0%   to   $1.9 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $2.4 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily a result of a $429,000 cancellation fee incurred during the third quarter of 2015 as a result of the early termination of a data processing contract. 
  State and local taxes increased $201,000, or 32.5%, to $820,000 during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from $619,000 during the    three months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to the recognition of $191,000 of state tax based on the preliminary findings of the Department of Revenue audit of Washington Banking Company for the years 2010 to 2014.  For additional information, see Note (15) Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1, Part I, of this Form 10-Q. 
  Federal Deposit Insurance premium decreased   $203,000  , or   40.7%   to   $296,000   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $499,000   during the    three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was a result of the FDIC's new assessment rate schedule effective for the third quarter of 2016 due to the increase in the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve.  Effective July 1, 2016, the range of initial base assessment rates for all insured institutions was reduced based on current reserve levels.  
  Other real estate owned, net decreased   $137,000  , or   2,740.0%  , to income of   $142,000   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to income of   $5,000   during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The gains on sale of other real estate owned was   $131,000   during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $3,000 for   three months ended September 30, 2015  .

The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in courier services as the Company discontinued its regular scheduled service during   2015  .  The Company also experienced decreases in other employee-related expenses such as travel expenses, office supplies, and other business expenses given the decrease in number of full-time equivalents and a concerted effort of the Company to reduce other expenses.  
  The ratio of noninterest expense to average assets (annualized) was   2.81%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   3.05%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily a result of an increase in assets and cost efficiencies gained and the above mentioned efforts by the Company to reduce noninterest expenses. 
    
  Comparison of nine months ended   September 30, 2016   to the comparable period in the prior year 
  Noninterest expense increased   $225,000  , or   0.3%  , to   $79.7 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $79.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

In addition, these expenses increased due to an increase in rent in the metro markets, offset partially by the closure of branches between the periods. 
  Other real estate owned, net decreased   $524,000  , or   61.4%  , to   $330,000   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $854,000   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The Bank had   no   other real estate owned at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.1 million   at   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in other real estate owned was due to the disposition of all remaining properties, resulting in a decrease of $255,000 in property related expenses and net gains on sale of other real estate owned of   $173,000   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to net losses on sale of other real estate owned of $94,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Financial Condition Overview 
  Total assets increased   $195.6 million  , or   5.4%  , to   $3.85 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $3.65 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Total loans receivable, net, increased   $176.5 million  , or   7.4%  , to   $2.55 billion   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.37 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  Loans were primarily funded through an increase in deposits, an increase in FHLB advances and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents.  Deposits increased by   $134.1 million  , or   4.3%  , to   $3.24 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $3.11 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  .  FHLB advances increased to   $17.7 million     at   September 30, 2016     from no borrowings at   December 31, 2015  . Cash and cash equivalents decreased   $13.9 million  , or   11.0%  , to   $112.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $126.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  .   
  Investment securities available for sale increased   $7.3 million  , or   0.9%  , to   $819.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $811.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase was due to investment purchases and increases in unrealized gains on investment securities as a result of increases in market values, offset partially by sales, maturities, calls and principal payments. 
  Prepaid expenses and other assets increased   $16.5 million  , or   28.2%  , to   $74.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $58.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to $19.7 million of investments in low income housing tax credit partnerships and a $2.8 million increase in interest rate swaps, offset partially by a decrease in current and deferred tax assets of $5.0 million.   
  Total non-maturity deposits increased to   88.6%   of total deposits at   September 30, 2016   from   86.5%   at   December 31, 2015   and certificates of deposits decreased to   11.4%   of total deposits at   September 30, 2016   from   13.5%   at   December 31, 2015  .

  Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased   $18.3 million  , or   61.1%  , to   $48.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $29.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The increase was primarily a result of the $19.7 million of investment obligations in low income housing tax credit partnerships entered into during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , of which $3.3 million was funded during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  These obligations will decrease as projects are funded.  The increase was additionally due to a $2.8 million increase in interest rate swaps, offset partially by a decrease in general accounts payable during the comparative periods. 
  Total stockholders  equity increased by   $26.0 million  , or   5.5%  , to   $496.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $470.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was due primarily to net income of   $29.0 million   and an increase of   $8.5 million   in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by cash dividends declared and paid of   $10.5 million  , common stock repurchases totaling   $2.9 million   and restricted stock compensation expense of   $1.4 million  .  The Company s equity position remains strong at   12.9%   of total assets as of   September 30, 2016   and as of   December 31, 2015  .

Nonperforming Assets and Credit Quality Metrics 
  The following table describes our nonperforming assets and other credit quality metrics at the dates indicated:   

Nonperforming assets decreased   $147,000  , or   1.3%  , to   $11.5 million  , or   0.30%   of total assets, at   September 30, 2016   from   $11.7 million  , or   0.32%   of total assets at   December 31, 2015  .  The Bank had   no   other real estate owned at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $2.0 million   at December 31, 2015.  The decrease in other real estate owned was due to the disposition of all remaining properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The decrease in nonperforming assets is partially offset by an increase of   $1.9 million   in nonaccrual loans.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to $6.9 million in additions to nonaccrual loans and $1.1 million of TDR loans transferred to nonaccrual status, offset partially by $5.3 million of net principal reductions and $569,000 of charge-offs.  
  Performing TDR loans were   $19.7 million   and   $20.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The   $1.0 million  , or   4.7%  , decrease in performing TDR loans for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily the result of $1.4 million of net principal payments and $1.1 million of loans transferred to nonaccrual status, partially offset by $1.7 million of loans restructured during the period.  At both   September 30, 2016

     Table of Contents  

and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had recorded   $1.8 million   in allowance for loan losses on the performing TDR loans. 
  Potential problem loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $101.0 million   and   $110.4 million  , respectively. Potential problem loans are those loans that are currently accruing interest and are not considered impaired, but which we are monitoring because the financial information of the borrower causes concerns as to their ability to meet their loan repayment terms. Loans that are past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest are both well secured and in the process of collection. The   $9.4 million  , or   8.5%  , decrease in potential problem loans was primarily the result of $20.9 million of net principal payments, $12.9 million of loan grade improvements, $5.3 million of loans transferred to impaired status and $1.8 million of loan charge-offs, partially offset by the addition of loans graded as potential problem loans of $32.2 million during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 

Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses 
  Management maintains an allowance for loan losses ( ALL ) to provide for estimated probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The adequacy of the ALL is monitored through our ongoing quarterly loan quality assessments. 
  We assess the estimated credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio by considering a number of elements including: 
     Historical loss experience in the loan portfolio; 
     Balance of potential problem loans in the loan portfolio; 
     Impact of environmental factors, including: 
     Levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; 
     Levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; 
             
    Effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; 
        Experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; 
     National and local economic trends and conditions; 
     Other external factors such as competition, legal, and regulatory; 
     Effects of changes in credit concentrations; and 
     Other factors 
  We calculate an appropriate ALL for loans in our loan portfolio, except PCI loans, by applying historical loss factors for homogeneous classes of the portfolio, adjusted for changes to the above-noted environmental factors. We may record specific provisions for impaired loans, including loans on nonaccrual status and TDRs, after a careful analysis of each loan s credit and collateral factors. Our analysis of an appropriate ALL combines the provisions made for our non-classified loans, classified loans, and the specific provisions made for each impaired loan. 
  The allowance for loan losses on loans designated as non-PCI loans is similar to the methodology described above except that for non-PCI loans, the remaining unaccreted discounts resulting from the fair value adjustments recorded at the time the loans were purchased are additionally factored into the allowance methodology. 
  For the PCI loans, the acquisition date fair value incorporated our estimate of future expected cash flows until the ultimate resolution of these credits.  To the extent actual or projected cash flows are less than previously estimated, additional provisions for loan losses on the PCI loan portfolio will be recognized immediately into earnings. To the extent actual or projected cash flows are more than previously estimated, the increase in cash flows is recognized immediately as a recapture of provision for loan losses up to the previously recognized provision for that loan or pool of loans, if any, and then prospectively recognized in interest income as a yield adjustment. 
  While we believe we use the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses under our methodology, results of operations could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the allowance.  A decline in local and national economic conditions, or other factors, could result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and may adversely affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of their routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional allowance allocations based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.

     Table of Contents  

The following table provides information regarding changes in our allowance for loan losses as of and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015: 

The allowance for loan losses was   $30.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $29.7 million     at   December 31, 2015  , which was the result of net charge-offs of   $3.3 million   and provision for loan losses of   $3.8 million   recorded during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Of the   $3.3 million   of net charge-offs, $1.0 million related to the closure of a PCI loan pool during the second quarter of 2016.  This pool closure accounting entry represents past residual losses estimated and provided for in the pool's allocated allowance for loan loss.  As the last loan in the pool was resolved during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Bank recognized these past losses as a charge-off to the allowance for loan losses.   
  The Bank recorded two significant commercial and industrial loan recoveries during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   totaling $915,000.  As a result of these recoveries, the ratio of net recoveries to average loans receivable was to   0.05%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to net charge-offs of   0.02%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .   
  The Bank recorded two significant commercial and industrial loan charge-offs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   totaling $1.8 million because of defaults by the borrowers in addition to the $1.0 million charge-off related to the closure of a PCI loan pool discussed above.  The Bank also recorded $698,000 of recoveries on one of these two significant loan charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Based on these events, the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans receivable increased to   0.18%   for the   nine months ended September 30,  
  
   63 

     Table of Contents  

2016   from   0.11%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The methodology we use to estimate the allowance for loan losses factors in historical losses over the 12-quarter rolling historical period as well as other credit quality indicators, many of which showed improvement from prior periods.  As a result, even though net charge-offs increased as compared to the prior periods, as did nonperforming loans as described below, the allowance for loan losses to loans receivable, net, decreased to   1.17%   at   September 30, 2016   from   1.24%   at   December 31, 2015  .   
  Nonperforming loans increased   $1.9 million  , or   19.4%  , to   $11.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $9.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Nonperforming loans to loans receivable, net was   0.45%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.40%   at   December 31, 2015  , and the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was   261.79%   at   September 30, 2016   and   307.67%   at   December 31, 2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank identified   $31.3 million   of impaired loans, of which   $11.9 million   had no specific valuation allowance as their estimated collateral value or discounted estimated cash flow is equal to or exceeds their carrying value. The remaining   $19.4 million   of impaired loans at   September 30, 2016   had related specific valuation allowances totaling   $2.5 million  .  This is compared to   $30.4 million   of impaired loans at December 31, 2015, of which   $6.0 million   had no specific valuation allowance and   $24.3 million   had   $3.3 million   of specific valuation allowance. 
  Based on the established comprehensive methodology, management deemed the allowance for loan losses of   $30.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   (  1.17%   of loans receivable, net and   261.79%   of nonperforming loans) appropriate to provide for probable incurred credit losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at that date.  This compares to an allowance for loan losses at   December 31, 2015   of   $29.7 million   (  1.24%   of loans receivable, net and   307.67%   of nonperforming loans).  At the applicable acquisition or merger dates, no allowance for loan losses was established on purchased loans as the loans were accounted for at their fair value and a discount was established for the loans.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the remaining fair value discount for these purchased loans was $14.7 million and $20.4 million, respectively. 
  The following table outlines the allowance for loan losses and related loan balances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

While the Bank believes it has established its existing allowances for loan losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there can be no assurance that bank regulators, in reviewing the Bank s loan portfolio, will not request the Bank to increase significantly its allowance for loan losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is appropriate or that increased provisions will not be necessary should the credit quality of the loans deteriorate. Any

     Table of Contents  

material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
  Based on management s assessment of loan quality and current economic conditions, the Company believes that its allowance for loan losses was appropriate to absorb the probable incurred losses and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016  . 

Deposits and Other Borrowings 
  As indicated in the table below, total deposits were   $3.24 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $134.1 million  , or   4.3%  , from   $3.11 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . 

The increase in deposits was the result of customer activities. Non-maturity deposits (total deposits less certificates of deposit) increased   $185.8 million  , or   6.9%  , to   $2.87 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $2.69 billion   at   December 31, 2015   and certificate of deposit accounts have decreased   $51.7 million  , or   12.3%  , to   $368.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $420.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Based on the change in the mix and volume of deposits, the percentage of certificates of deposit to total deposits decreased to   11.4%   at   September 30, 2016   from   13.5%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds (such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels). Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending activities and match the maturity of repricing intervals of assets. The Bank is utilizing securities sold under agreement to repurchase as a supplement to its funding sources. Our repurchase agreements are secured by available for sale investment securities.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had securities sold under agreement to repurchase of   $22.4 million  , a decrease of   $789,000  , or   3.4%  , from   $23.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease is the result of customer activity during the period. 
  The Company also has junior subordinated debentures with a par value of   $25.0 million   which pay quarterly interest based on three-month LIBOR plus 1.56%.  The debentures mature in 2037.  The balance of the junior subordinated debentures at   September 30, 2016   was   $19.6 million  , which reflects the fair value of the debentures established during the merger with Washington Banking, adjusted for the accretion of discount from purchase accounting fair value adjustment.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank maintained credit facilities with the FHLB of Des Moines for   $664.5 million   and credit facilities with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for   $51.2 million  .  The Company had   $17.7 million   of FHLB advances outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2015.  The average cost of the FHLB advances during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was     0.54%  .  The Bank also maintains lines of credit with four correspondent banks to purchase federal funds totaling   $90.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . There were no federal funds purchased as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  We are required to maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals, satisfy other financial commitments, and fund operations. We generally maintain sufficient cash and short-term investments to meet short-term liquidity needs.  At   September 30, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents totaled   $112.8 million  , or   2.9%   of total assets.  In addition,   $1.5 million   of the   $5.5 million   of other interest earning deposits are scheduled to mature within one year of   September 30, 2016  .  The fair value of investment securities available for sale totaled   $819.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   of which   $256.5 million   were pledged to secure public deposits or borrowing arrangements.   The fair value of investment securities available for sale that were not pledged to secure public deposits or borrowing arrangements totaled   $562.6 million  , or   14.6%  , of total assets at  
  
   65 

     Table of Contents  

September 30, 2016  .  The fair value of investment securities available for sale with maturities of one year or less were   $3.6 million  , or   0.09%  , of total assets at   September 30, 2016  .  

Liquidity and Cash Flows 
  Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits, loan principal and interest payments and interest earned on and proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities. These funds, together with retained earnings, equity and other borrowed funds (as necessary), are used to make loans, acquire investment securities and other assets, and fund continuing operations. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. In addition to customer deposits, management may utilize the use of brokered deposits on an as-needed basis. 
  Heritage Bank:   The principal objective of the Bank s liquidity management program is to maintain the ability to meet day-to-day cash flow requirements of its customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs. The Bank monitors the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position. In addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayment and maturities of loans, the Bank can utilize established credit facilities and lines with correspondent banks or sale of investment securities.  
  Heritage Financial Corporation:   The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. Substantially all of the Company s revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. However, management believes that such restrictions will not have an adverse impact on the ability of the Company to meets its ongoing cash obligations.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company (on an unconsolidated basis) had cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale with no stated maturities of $10.1 million. 
  Consolidated Cash Flows:   As disclosed in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, net cash provided by operating activities was   $40.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and primarily consisted of proceeds from sale of loans held for sale of   $103.6 million  , net income of   $29.0 million  , depreciation and amortization of   $9.5 million   and provision for loan losses of   $3.8 million  , partially offset by originations for loans held for sale of   $99.5 million  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash used in investing activities was   $192.4 million  , which consisted primarily of purchases of investment securities available for sale of   $188.2 million   and net loan originations of   $179.9 million  , offset partially by proceeds from sales of investment securities available for sale of   $94.4 million   and maturities of investment securities available for sale of   $94.3 million  .  Net cash provided in financing activities was   $138.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and primarily consisted of a net increase in deposits of   $134.1 million   and FHLB advances of   $403.1 million  , offset partially by repayments of FHLB advances of   $385.4 million  , a   $10.5 million   payment of cash dividends on common stock and   $2.9 million   of repurchases of common stock. 

Capital and Capital Requirements 
  Stockholders  equity at   September 30, 2016   was   $496.0 million   compared with   $470.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company realized net income of   $29.0 million  , declared and paid cash dividends of   $10.5 million  , recorded other comprehensive income of   $8.5 million  , recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock, net of tax effect, totaling   $1.5 million  , recorded   $421,000   related to the exercise of stock options, net of tax effect, and repurchased common stock for   $2.9 million  . 
  Pursuant to minimum capital requirements of the FDIC effective on January 1, 2015, all FDIC-insured financial institutions, including Heritage Bank, are required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio to average assets of 4.0% and minimum risk-based capital ratios of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and total capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the most recent regulatory notifications categorized Heritage Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s categories.  The following table provides our capital requirements and actual results. 
  
   66 

     Table of Contents  

Although new capital requirements were effective on January 1, 2015, certain provisions of the new rule will be phased-in from the effective date through 2019, including, among others, a new capital conservation buffer requirement, which requires financial institutions to maintain a common equity capital ratio more than 2.5% above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased-in on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, and will continue to increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.  At   September 30, 2016  , the capital conservation buffer was 5.00% and 4.66% for the Company and the Bank, respectively.   
  Quarterly, the Company reviews the potential payment of cash dividends to its common shareholders. The timing and amount of cash dividends paid on our common stock depends on the Company s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other relevant factors. Dividends on common stock from the Company depend substantially upon receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is the Company s predominant source of income. On   October 26, 2016  , the Company s Board of Directors declared a regular dividend of   $0.12   per common share and a special dividend of   $0.25   payable on   November 22, 2016   to shareholders of record on   November 8, 2016  .

ITEM 3.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Our results of operations are highly dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk. We consider interest rate risk to be a significant market risk that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Interest rate risk is measured and assessed on a quarterly basis. In our opinion, there has not been a material change in our interest rate risk exposure since the information disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  We do not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument nor do we engage in hedging activities or purchase high-risk derivative instruments. Moreover, we have no material foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk. 

ITEM 4.      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
  An evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedure (as defined in Section 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Act )) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the Company s Disclosure Committee as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. In designing and evaluating the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on their evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016   are effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  
  (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Act) that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The Company does not expect that its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud.  A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

ITEM 2.     UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
    
  The Company has had various stock repurchase programs since March 1999. On October 23, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   5%   of the Company's outstanding common shares, or approximately   1,513,000   shares, under the eleventh stock repurchase plan.  The number, timing and price of shares repurchased will depend on business and market conditions, and other factors, including opportunities to deploy the Company's capital.  
    
  The following table provides total repurchased shares and average share prices under the applicable plan for the periods indicated:  

(1) Represents shares repurchased and average price per share paid during the duration of each plan. 
  In addition to the stock repurchases disclosed in the table above, the Company repurchased shares to pay withholding taxes on the vesting of restricted stock.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   5,267   and    29,206   shares of common stock at an average price per share of   $18.64   and   $17.77  , respectively, to pay withholding taxes on the vesting of restricted stock that vested during the respective periods.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company repurchased   388   and   21,998   shares of common stock at an average price per share of   $17.63   and   $17.07  , respectively, to pay withholding taxes on the vesting of restricted stock that vested during the respective periods.
