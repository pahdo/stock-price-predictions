  The information in this report contains various statements relating to future financial performance, results of operations and other statements, including certain projections and business trends, that are not historical facts.  These statements constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act     ), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the      Exchange Act     ) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 about us that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

     Such risks and uncertainties are beyond our ability to control, and in many cases we cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should our underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. In addition to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions described above, you should also carefully read and consider the risk factors and forward-looking statement disclosure contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by applicable law or regulation.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1   Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation  
  Rowan Companies plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, is a global provider of offshore contract drilling services to the international oil and gas industry. Our fleet currently consists of   31   mobile offshore drilling units, including   27   self-elevating jack-up drilling units and   four   ultra-deepwater drillships. We contract our drilling rigs, related equipment and work crews primarily on a day-rate basis in markets throughout the world, currently including the United States Gulf of Mexico (US GOM), the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, the Middle East and Trinidad. 
  The financial statements included in this Form 10-Q are presented in United States (U.S.) dollars and include the accounts of Rowan Companies plc (     Rowan plc     ) and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms  Rowan,   Company,   we,   us  and  our  are used to refer to Rowan plc and its consolidated subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The financial statements included in this Form 10-Q have been prepared without audit in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (     US GAAP ) for interim financial information and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (     SEC ). Certain information and notes have been condensed or omitted as permitted by those rules and regulations. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management believes the accompanying financial statements contain all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise noted, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. The Company s results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Customer Contract Termination and Settlement 
  On May 23, 2016, the Company reached an agreement with Freeport-McMoRan Oil and Gas LLC ( FMOG ) and its parent company, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ( FCX ) in connection with the drilling contract for the drillship   Rowan Relentless   ( FMOG Agreement ), which was scheduled to terminate in June 2017. The FMOG Agreement provided that the drilling contract be terminated immediately, and that FCX pay the Company   $215 million   to settle outstanding receivables and early termination of the contract, of which   $85 million   was received through June 30, 2016 and the remaining   $130 million   was received in the third quarter 2016. In addition, the Company may also receive two additional contingent payments from FCX, payable on September 30, 2017, of   $10 million   and   $20 million   depending on the average price of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude oil over a   12  -month period beginning June 30, 2016. The   $10 million   payment will be due if the average price over the period is greater than   $50   per barrel and the additional   $20 million   payment will be due if the average price over the period is greater than   $65   per barrel ( FMOG Provision ) (See Note 6). The Company warm-stacked the   Rowan Relentless   in order to reduce costs. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized   $173.2 million   in revenue for the   Rowan Relentless  , including   $130.9 million   for the cancelled contract value,   $6.2 million   for the fair value of the derivative associated with the FMOG Provision (See Note 6),   $5.6 million   for previously deferred revenue related to the contract, and   $30.5 million   for operations through May 22, 2016. 
  Day Rate Concessions 
  On June 1, 2016, the Company executed a contract extension for the   Rowan Viking   of   270   days for   $275,000   per day following the primary term of the original contract in exchange for day rate concessions reducing the day rate for the primary term from   $345,528   per day to   $275,000   per day. This reduced day rate was applied to January 1, 2016 through November 6, 2017, and as a result, the Company recorded a reduction to revenue for amounts earned under this contract during the period from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016 of   $6.3 million   in the second quarter of 2016. 
  Customer Contract Amendment 
  On September 15, 2016  ,   the Company amended its contract with Cobalt International Energy, L.P. ( Cobalt ), for the drillship   Rowan Reliance  , which was scheduled to conclude on February 1, 2018. The amendment provides that the Company will receive cash settlement payments totaling   $95.9 million  , that the drillship remains at its current day rate of approximately   $582,000   and that the drilling contract may be terminated as early as March 31, 2017. The Company received cash payments of   $45.0 million   on September 15, 2016 and   $31.3 million   on October 3, 2016, and expects to receive a final cash payment of   $19.6 million   on or

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 

before March 31, 2017. In addition, if Cobalt continues its operations with the   Rowan Reliance   after March 31, 2017, the day rate will be reduced to approximately   $262,000   per day for the remaining operating days through February 1, 2018 (subject to further adjustment thereafter). Cobalt International Energy, Inc., the parent of Cobalt, also committed to use the Company as its exclusive provider of comparable drilling services for a period of   five years  . As the Company has the obligation and intent to have the drillship or a substitute available through the pre-amended contract scheduled end date, in certain circumstances, the   $95.9 million   settlement was recorded as a deferred revenue liability. As of September 30, 2016,   $57.5 million   and   $38.4 million   of the deferred revenue liability is classified as current and noncurrent, respectively, and is included in Deferred Revenue, and Other Liabilities, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amortization of deferred revenue will begin on April 1, 2017 and extend no further than the pre-amended contract scheduled end date. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  Revenue Recognition         In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   which sets forth a global standard for revenue recognition and replaces most existing industry-specific guidance. We will be required to adopt the new standard in annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018.   The amendments may be applied using a retrospective, modified retrospective or prospective with a cumulative catch-up approach.   We are evaluating the standard and have   not yet determined our implementation method upon adoption or what impact adoption will have on our financial statements. 
  Presentation of Deferred Taxes       In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,   which requires entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in balance sheets as noncurrent. We will be required to adopt the new standard in annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2017.   The amendments in this ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We are evaluating the standard and have not yet determined our implementation method.     
  Lease Accounting       In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases,   which requires the balance sheet recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for leases previously classified as operating leases under prior GAAP. We will be required to adopt the new standard in annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019. Lessees and lessors will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach, including a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. We are evaluating the standard and have not yet   determined our implementation method upon adoption or what impact adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements.     
  Stock Compensation         In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting,   which simplifies several aspects of accounting for employee share-based payment awards, including the accounting for income taxes, withholding taxes and forfeitures, as well as classification on the statement of cash flows. We will be required to adopt the amended guidance in annual and interim reports beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of determining the method of adoption and the impact this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements  .    
  Financial Instruments         In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,   which amends the FASB's guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. The ASU adds to US GAAP an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses. We will be required to adopt the amended guidance in annual and interim reports beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are in the process of evaluating the impact this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements  .  
  Statement of Cash Flows   - In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,   which provides guidance on eight cash flow classification issues with the objective of reducing differences in practice. We will be required to adopt the amendments in this ASU in annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption is required to be on a retrospective basis, unless impracticable for any of the amendments, in which case a prospective application is permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact these amendments will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Income Taxes   - In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory  , which eliminates the exception that prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income tax effects for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory until the asset has been sold to an outside party. We will be required to adopt the amendments in this ASU in the annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made

Other postretirement benefit cost recognized during the periods included the following components (in millions): 

On August 10, 2016, the Company communicated changes to the participants of its postretirement benefits plan that was previously frozen to new entrants in 2008. Based on these changes, effective as of January 1, 2017, eligible participants will now receive a health reimbursement account that provides a fixed dollar benefit per year. The impact of these changes to the plan and related, as of August 10, 2016, are presented in the table below (in millions): 

The Company records unrealized gains and losses related to net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost net of estimated taxes in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company has a valuation allowance against its net U.S. deferred tax asset that is not expected to be realized. A portion of this valuation allowance is related to deferred tax benefits or expense as recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).   
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company contributed   $22.7 million   to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans and expects to make additional contributions to such plans totaling approximately   $8.2 million   for the remainder of   2016  . 
   
  Note 4   Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
  Uncertain tax positions     We have been advised by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service of proposed unfavorable tax adjustments of   $85 million   including applicable penalties for the open tax years 2009 through 2012. The unfavorable tax adjustments primarily related to the following items: 2009 tax benefits recognized as a result of applying the facts of a third-party tax case that provided favorable tax treatment for certain foreign contracts entered into in prior years to the Company s situation; transfer pricing; and domestic production activity deduction. We have submitted a formal protest in response to these unfavorable proposed tax adjustments. In years subsequent to 2012, we have similar positions that could be subject to adjustments for the open years. We have provided for amounts that we believe will be ultimately payable under the proposed adjustments and intend to vigorously defend our positions; however, if we determine the provisions for these matters to be inadequate due to new information or we are required to pay a significant amount of additional U.S. taxes and applicable penalties and interest in excess of amounts that have been provided for these matters, our consolidated results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
  The gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding penalties and interest are   $119 million   and   $65 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The increase to gross unrecognized tax benefits was primarily due to tax positions taken of   $7 million   related to current year-to-date anticipated transfer pricing positions and   $42 million   related to prior year U.S. interest deductions. Reversal of net unrecognized tax benefits excluding penalties and interest would impact our tax by   $66 million  . 
  It is reasonable that the existing liabilities for the unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease over the next 12 months as a result of audit closures and statute expirations, however, the ultimate timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain.

Letters of credit     We periodically employ letters of credit in the normal course of our business, and had outstanding letters of credit of approximately   $9.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Pending or threatened litigation     We are involved in various legal proceedings incidental to our business and are vigorously defending our position in all such matters. Although the outcome of such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect resolution of these matters to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  Note 5   Share-Based Compensation 
  On February 25, 2016, the Company granted restricted share units ( RSUs ) to employees for annual incentive awards pursuant to our long-term incentive plan with a grant-date fair value aggregating   $19.3 million  . The awards vest ratably over   three   years except to the extent they may vest earlier under our retirement policy. The aggregate grant-date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, was   $18.2 million  , which will be recognized as compensation expense over a weighted-average period of   2.6 years   from the grant date.   
  Additionally, on February 25, 2016, the Company granted to certain members of management performance units ( P-Units ) that have a target value of   $100   per unit. The amount ultimately earned with respect to the P-Units will depend on the Company s total shareholder return ( TSR ) relative to a group of peer companies over a   three  -year period ending December 31, 2018, and could range from   zero   to   $200   per unit depending on performance.   Twenty-five percent   of the P-Units  value is determined by the Company s relative TSR ranking for each   one  -year period ended   December 31, 2016  ,   2017  , and   2018  , respectively, and   25%   of the P-Units  value is determined by the relative TSR ranking for the   three  -year period ending December 31, 2018. The P-Units cliff vest on the third anniversary following the grant date. Settlement may be in cash or shares at the Board's discretion. 
  The grant-date fair value of the P-Units was estimated to be   $8.6 million  . Fair value was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which considers the probabilities of the Company s TSR ranking at the end of each performance period and the amount of the payout at each rank to determine the probability-weighted expected payout. The Company uses liability accounting to account for the P-Units. Compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over a maximum period of   three   years from the grant date and is adjusted for changes in fair value through the vesting date.  
  Estimated liabilities for P-Units as of   September 30, 2016  , included   $9.8 million   and   $10.6 million   classified as current and noncurrent, respectively, compared to   $7.6 million   and   $11.4 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  . Current and noncurrent estimated P-Unit liabilities are included in Accrued Liabilities, and Other Liabilities, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , estimated unrecognized share-based compensation totaled approximately   $36.9 million  , which is expected to be recognized as compensation expense over a remaining weighted-average period of   1.7 years  . 
   
  Note 6   Derivatives 
  The Company determined that the FMOG Provision of the FMOG Agreement is a freestanding financial instrument and that it met the criteria of a derivative instrument ( Contingent Payment Derivative ). The Contingent Payment Derivative was initially recorded to revenue at a fair value of   $6.2 million   on May 23, 2016, and will be revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as non-operating income or expense. The fair value of the Contingent Payment Derivative was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation (See Note 7).

Note 7   Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prescribed by US GAAP requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: 
             
    Level 1   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 
                
    Level 2   Quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 
                
    Level 3   Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable, such as those used in pricing models or discounted cash flow methodologies, for example. 
     The applicable level within the fair value hierarchy is the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
  Derivative 
  The fair value of the Contingent Payment Derivative (Level 3) was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which calculates the probabilities of the daily closing WTI spot price exceeding the   $50   price target and the   $65   price target ( Price Targets ), respectively, on a daily averaging basis during the   12  -month payment measurement period ending on June 30, 2017. The probabilities are applied to the payout at each Price Target to calculate the probability-weighted expected payout. The following are the significant inputs used in the valuation of the Contingent Payment Derivative: the WTI Spot Price on the valuation date, the expected volatility, and the risk-free interest rate, and the slope of the WTI forward curve, which were   $47.48  ,   37.5%  ,   0.765%   and   5.5%   at May 23, 2016, respectively and   $48.24  ,   34.85%  ,   0.589%  , and   9.25%   at   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The expected volatility was estimated from the implied volatility rates of WTI Crude Futures. The risk-free rate was based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities commensurate with the remaining term of the Contingent Payment Derivative. 
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions):

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held a Contingent Payment Derivative in the amount of   $4.2 million  , which is classified as Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held Egyptian pounds in the amount of   $9.1 million   and   $13.5 million  , respectively, which are classified as Other Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We ceased drilling operations in Egypt in 2014, and are currently working to obtain access to the funds for use outside Egypt to the extent they are not utilized.  We can provide no assurance we will be able to convert or utilize such funds in the future.  
  Trade receivables and trade payables, which are required to be measured at fair value, have carrying values that approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. 
  Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and whose carrying values were remeasured during the nine months ended September 30 are set forth below (in millions): 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we conducted an impairment test of our assets and determined that the carrying values for   five   of our jack-up drilling units were not recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows and exceeded the rigs' estimated fair values measured under an income approach. As a result, we recognized a noncash impairment charge of   $34.3 million   which is included in Material Charges and Other Operating Items on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we conducted an impairment test of our assets and determined that the carrying values for   ten   of our jack-up drilling units were not recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows and exceeded the rigs' estimated fair values measured under an income approach. As a result, we recognized a noncash impairment charge of   $329.8 million   which is included in Material Charges and Other Operating Items on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
  In each case, our estimate of fair value required us to use significant unobservable inputs, which are internally developed assumptions not observable in the market, including assumptions related to future demand for drilling services, estimated availability of rigs, and future day rates, among others. 
  Other Fair Value Measurements  
  Financial instruments not required to be measured at fair value consist of the Company s publicly traded debt securities. Our publicly traded debt securities had a carrying value of   $2.646 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and an estimated fair value at that date aggregating   $2.223 billion  , compared to a carrying and fair value of   $2.692 billion   and   $2.072 billion  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  . Fair values of our publicly traded debt securities were provided by a broker who makes a market in such securities and were measured using a market-approach valuation technique, which is a Level 2 fair value measurement.

Long-term Debt     Long-term debt consisted of the following (in millions): 

In the first quarter of 2016, we paid   $15.9 million   in cash to retire   $16.5 million   aggregate principal amount of the   5%   Senior Notes due 2017 and   7.875%   Senior Notes due 2019, plus accrued interest, and recognized a   $0.6 million   gain on early extinguishment of debt.   
  Also during the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased an additional   $21.4 million   aggregate principal amount of the   5%   and   7.875%   Senior Notes, which settled in April 2016 and resulted in a   $1.2 million   gain on early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2016. 
  In April 2016, we repurchased   $10.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the   7.875%   Senior Notes which resulted in a   $0.6 million   gain on early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2016. 
  Supplemental Cash Flow Information     Accrued capital expenditures, which are excluded from capital expenditures in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows until settlement, totaled   $23.2 million   and   $36.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Interest capitalized in connection with rig construction projects totaled   $16.2 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We did   not   capitalize any interest for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Income Taxes       In accordance with US GAAP for interim reporting, the Company estimates its full-year effective tax rate and applies this rate to its year-to-date pretax income. In addition, the Company separately calculates the tax impact of unusual items, if any. We provide for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which we conduct operations. The amounts of our provisions are impacted by such laws and rates and the availability of deductions, credits and other benefits in each of the various jurisdictions. Our overall effective tax rate may therefore vary considerably from quarter to quarter and from year to year based on the actual or projected location of operations, levels of income, our consolidated effective income tax rate, deferred intercompany gains or losses, and other factors. 
  We recognized tax benefits of   $12.2 million   and tax expense of   $14.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to tax expense of   $25.9 million   and   $50.9 million   for the comparable periods in   2015  . 
  Our effective tax rate was   181.2%   as a result of a tax benefit on a pre-tax loss and   4.1%   as a result of tax expense on pre-tax income, respectively, for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   (12.2)%   as a result of tax expense on a pre-tax loss and   256.2%   as a result of tax expense on pre-tax income, respectively, for the comparable prior-year periods ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  The decrease in tax expense of   $38.1 million   resulting in a tax benefit and the decrease in tax expense of   $36.2 million   for the   three and nine   month periods compared to the prior-year periods is primarily attributed to: 
             
    the prior-year period s discrete tax expense for the establishment of a full valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets; 
     
   16 

     Table of Contents  
  ROWAN COMPANIES PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 
    
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 

the current period discrete tax benefit for the decrease in the U.S. valuation allowance due to additional current earnings in other comprehensive income related to the change in our postretirement benefit plan; 
                
    a change in the geographic mix of earnings including a reduction of income in the high tax jurisdictions; and  
                
    a partial offset by the prior-year period s discrete additional tax benefit for the U.S. -impaired assets.  
     The Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of its non-U.K. subsidiaries, including non-U.S. entities under Rowan Companies, Inc. ( RCI ). It is the Company s policy and intention to permanently reinvest outside the U.S. the earnings of non-U.S. entities directly or indirectly owned by RCI. Generally, earnings of non-U.K. entities in which RCI does not have a direct or indirect ownership interest can be distributed to the Company without imposition of either U.K. or local country tax. 
  Material Charges and Other Operating Items       Material charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include (i) non-cash asset impairment charges totaling   $34.3 million   on   five   jack-up drilling units (See Note 7) and (ii) a   $1.4 million   reversal of an estimated liability for settlement of a withholding tax matter during a tax amnesty period which was related to a legal settlement for a 2014 termination of a contract for refurbishment work on the   Rowan Gorilla III  , as noted below in the 2015 periods. Payment of such withholding taxes during the tax amnesty period resulted in the waiver of applicable penalties and interest. 
  Material charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes (i) non-cash asset impairment charges totaling   $329.8 million   on   ten   jack-up drilling units (See Note 7) and (ii) adjustments of   $2.6 million   and   $7.6 million  , respectively, to an estimated liability for the 2014 contract termination in connection with refurbishment work on the   Rowan Gorilla III  . A settlement agreement for this matter was signed during the third quarter of 2015. 
   
  Note 10   Segment Information 
  We operate in   two   principal operating segments       deepwater, which consists of our drillship operations, and jack-ups. Both segments provide one service       contract drilling. The Company evaluates performance primarily based on income from operations.  
  Depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses related to our corporate function and other administrative offices have not been allocated to our operating segments for purposes of measuring segment operating income and are included in  Unallocated costs and other.   Other operating items  consists of non-cash impairment charges, and gains and losses on equipment sales and litigation and related.

ROWAN COMPANIES PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
   
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  . The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of our Annual Report, as may be updated or supplemented in our subsequent Quarterly Reports. See  Forward-Looking Statements.  
  OVERVIEW 
  Rowan plc is a global provider of offshore contract drilling services to the international oil and gas industry, with a focus on high-specification and premium jack-up rigs and ultra-deepwater drillships. Our fleet currently consists of   31   mobile offshore drilling units, including   27   self-elevating jack-up rigs and   four   ultra-deepwater drillships. Our fleet operates worldwide, including the United States Gulf of Mexico ( US GOM ), the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, the Middle East and Trinidad.  
  As of   October 18, 2016  , the date of our most recent Fleet Status Report, three of our four drillships were under contract in the US GOM.  Additionally, we had four jack-up rigs under contract in the North Sea, nine under contract in the Middle East, three under contract in Trinidad and one under contract in the US GOM. We had an additional seven marketed jack-up rigs, three cold-stacked jack-up rigs and one marketed drillship without a contract.  
  We contract our drilling rigs, related equipment and work crews primarily on a  day rate  basis. Under day rate contracts, we generally receive a fixed amount per day for each day we are performing drilling or related services. In addition, our customers may pay all or a portion of the cost of moving our equipment and personnel to and from the well site. Contracts can range in duration from one month to multiple years.  
  Customer Contract Termination and Settlement 
  On May 23, 2016, we reached an agreement with Freeport-McMoRan Oil and Gas LLC ( FMOG ) and its parent company, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ( FCX ) in connection with the drilling contract for the drillship   Rowan Relentless   ( FMOG Agreement ), which was scheduled to terminate in June 2017. The FMOG Agreement provided that the drilling contract be terminated immediately, and that FCX pay us $215 million to settle outstanding receivables and early termination of the contract, of which $85 million was received through June 30, 2016 and the remaining $130 million was received in the third quarter 2016. In addition, we may also receive two additional contingent payments from FCX, payable on September 30, 2017, of $10 million and $20 million depending on the average price of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude oil over a 12-month period beginning June 30, 2016. The $10 million payment will be due if the average price over the period is greater than $50 per barrel and the additional $20 million payment will be due if the average price over the period is greater than $65 per barrel ( FMOG Provision ). We warm-stacked the   Rowan Relentless   in order to reduce costs. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we recognized $173.2 million in revenue for the   Rowan Relentless  , including $130.9 million for the cancelled contract value, $6.2 million for the fair value of the derivative associated with the FMOG Provision, $5.6 million for previously deferred revenue related to the contract and $30.5 million for operations through May 22, 2016. 
  Day Rate Concessions 
  On June 1, 2016, we executed a contract extension for the   Rowan Viking   of 270 days for $275,000 per day following the primary term of the original contract in exchange for day rate concessions reducing the day rate for the primary term from $345,528 per day to $275,000 per day. This reduced day rate was applied to January 1, 2016 through November 6, 2017, and as a result, we recorded a reduction to revenue for amounts earned under this contract during the period from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016 of $6.3 million in the second quarter of 2016. 
  Customer Contract Amendment 
  On September 15, 2016  ,   we amended our contract with Cobalt International Energy, L.P. ( Cobalt ), for the drillship   Rowan Reliance  , which was scheduled to conclude on February 1, 2018. The amendment provides that we will receive cash settlement payments totaling $95.9 million, that the drillship remains at its current day rate of approximately $582,000 and that the drilling contract may be terminated as early as March 31, 2017. We received cash payments of $45.0 million on September 15, 2016 and $31.3 million on October 3, 2016, and expect to receive a final cash payment of $19.6 million on or before March 31, 2017. In addition, if Cobalt continues its operations with the   Rowan Reliance   after March 31, 2017, the day rate will be reduced to  
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

approximately $262,000 per day for the remaining operating days through February 1, 2018 (subject to further adjustment thereafter). Cobalt International Energy, Inc., the parent of Cobalt, also committed to use us as their exclusive provider of comparable drilling services for a period of five years. As we have the obligation and intent to have the drillship or a substitute available through the pre-amended contract scheduled end date, in certain circumstances, the $95.9 million settlement was recorded as a deferred revenue liability. As of September 30, 2016, $57.5 million and $38.4 million of the deferred revenue liability is classified as current and noncurrent, respectively, and is included in Deferred Revenue, and Other Liabilities, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amortization of deferred revenue will begin on April 1, 2017 and extend no further than the pre-amended contract scheduled end date. 
   
  CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 
  The business environment for offshore drillers continues to be challenging as operators' capital expenditures have declined dramatically over the past two years. The resulting cancellation or postponement of drilling programs have resulted in significantly reduced demand for offshore drilling services globally. Additionally, the 227 new jack-ups and 158 new floaters that have been delivered since the beginning of the current newbuild cycle in early 2006, have exacerbated the situation. The rate of drilling contract terminations and expirations has continued to outpace new contract awards, resulting in reduced rig utilization and downward pressure on day rates. We expect this dynamic to continue well into 2017. Contractors have responded by stacking certain idle equipment and deferring newbuild deliveries, however, the jack-up and floater markets remain oversupplied.  
  Further, as of October 17, 2016, there were 107 additional jack-up rigs on order or under construction worldwide for delivery through 2020 (relative to approximately 293 jack-up rigs currently on contract), and 63 floaters on order or under construction worldwide for delivery through 2020 (relative to approximately 148 floater rigs currently on contract). Only eight jack-ups and 31 floaters currently on order or under construction have contracts secured for their future delivery dates. We expect several of these rigs may eventually be cancelled and many others will likely continue to be deferred until a recovery in demand is visible. 
  In response to market conditions, we have reduced day rates on certain drilling contracts, some in exchange for extended contract duration, sold or have under contract to sell four of our oldest jack-ups, cold-stacked three of our older jack-ups (one of which is under contract to sell), and have warm stacked seven of our jack-ups and one of our ultra-deepwater drillships. We have agreed to one termination of an ultra-deepwater drillship contract and agreed to reduce the duration of another contract in exchange for certain upfront payments. Similarly, we have had two early terminations of  jack-up rig contracts in recent months. Though in each case we have received or expect to receive a substantial portion of the backlog, these terminations add to the number of rigs available for work over the near term, likely increasing idle time in our fleet. 
  Given the current supply and demand dynamics and in the absence of a sustained recovery in commodity prices, we expect the business environment to continue to deteriorate into 2017 and remain relatively challenging over the intermediate term. These market conditions have increased our risk of customer defaults, restructurings or insolvency which may prompt further renegotiations or terminations of our drilling contracts. 
  However, we believe that we are strategically well-positioned given our strong and stable financial condition, current backlog of $2.2 billion as of   October 18, 2016  , solid operational reputation, and modern fleet of high-specification jack-ups and state-of-the-art ultra-deepwater drillships. While challenging market conditions persist, we continue to focus on operating and cost efficiencies which could include cold-stacking or retiring additional drilling rigs, layoffs or other cost cutting initiatives.

Other operating items  
  Material charges for the three months ended September 30, 2016, included a   $34.3 million   noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying values of five of our jack-up drilling units, partially offset by a $1.4 million reversal of an estimated liability for settlement of a withholding tax matter during a tax amnesty period which was related to a legal settlement for a 2014 termination of a contract for refurbishment work on the   Rowan Gorilla III  , as noted below in the 2015 period. Payment of such withholding taxes during the tax amnesty period resulted in the waiver of applicable penalties and interest. 
  Material charges for the three months ended September 30, 2015, included a $329.8 million noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying values of ten of our jack-up drilling units and a $2.6 million adjustment to an estimated liability for the 2014  termination of a contract in connection with refurbishment work on the   Rowan Gorilla III  . A settlement agreement for this matter was signed during the third quarter of 2015. 
  Losses on disposals of property and equipment decreased $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Other expense, net 
  The decrease in Other expense, net, is primarily related to a reduction in interest expense due to our debt retirements in late 2015 and early 2016. 
  Provision (benefit) for income taxes 
  We recognized tax benefits of $12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to tax expense of $25.9 million for the comparable period in 2015. 
  The decrease in tax expense of $38.1 million resulting in a tax benefit for the three month period compared to the prior-year period is primarily attributed to: 
             
    the prior-year period s discrete tax expense for the establishment of a full valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets;  
                
    the current period discrete tax benefit for the decrease in the U.S. valuation allowance due to additional current earnings in other comprehensive income related to the change in our postretirement benefit plan; 
                
    a change in the geographic mix of earnings including a reduction of income in the high tax jurisdictions; and  
                
    a partial offset by the prior-year period s discrete additional tax benefit for the U.S. -impaired assets.

Depreciation and amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased   largely due to the addition of the   Rowan Reliance   and   Rowan Relentless   in 2015. 
  Selling, general and administrative 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   largely due to lower personnel costs. In addition, professional fees and  information technology expenses decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Other operating items  
  Material charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included a   $34.3 million   noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying values of five of our jack-up drilling units, partially offset by a $1.4 million reversal of an estimated liability for settlement of a withholding tax matter during a tax amnesty period which was related to a legal settlement for a 2014 termination of a contract for refurbishment work on the   Rowan Gorilla III  , as noted below in the 2015 period. Payment of such withholding taxes during the tax amnesty period resulted in the waiver of applicable penalties and interest. 
  Material charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a $329.8 million noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying values of ten of our jack-up drilling units and a $7.6 million adjustment to an estimated liability for the 2014 termination of a contract for refurbishment work on the   Rowan Gorilla III  . A settlement agreement for this matter was signed during the third quarter of 2015. 
  Losses on disposals of property and equipment increased $3.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Other expense, net 
  The increase in Other expense, net, is primarily due to $16.2 million of interest capitalization in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. There was no interest capitalization in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as the drillship construction program was completed in 2015. Partially offsetting this increase, our debt retirements in late 2015 and early 2016 resulted in a reduction in interest expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, we recognized a gain of $2.4 million on the early extinguishment of debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
  Provision for income taxes 
  We recognized tax expense of $14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to tax expense of $50.9 million for the comparable period in 2015. 
  The decrease in the tax expense of $36.2 million for the nine month period compared to the prior-year period is primarily attributed to: 
             
    the prior-year period s discrete tax expense for the establishment of a full valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets; 
                
    the current period discrete tax benefit for the decrease in the U.S. valuation allowance due to additional current earnings in other comprehensive income related to the change in our postretirement benefit plan; 
                
    a change in the geographic mix of earnings including a reduction of income in the high tax jurisdictions; and  
                
    a partial offset by the prior-year period s additional tax benefit for the U.S. -impaired assets.

Rig Utilization 
  The following table sets forth an analysis of time that our rigs were idle or out-of-service as a percentage of available days (which excludes cold-stacked rigs) and time that our rigs experience operational downtime and are off-rate as a percentage of revenue-producing days:  

Idle days   We define idle days as the time a rig is not under contract and available to work. Idle days exclude cold-stacked rigs, which are not marketed.  
  Out-of-Service days   We define out-of-service days as those days when a rig is (or is planned to be) out of service and is not able to earn revenue. The Company may be compensated for certain out-of-service days, such as for shipyard stays or for rig transit periods preceding a contract; however, recognition of any such compensation is deferred and recognized over the primary term of the drilling contract.  
  Operational downtime   We define operational downtime as the unbillable time when a rig is under contract and unable to conduct planned operations due to equipment breakdowns or procedural failures.  
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  A comparison of key balance sheet amounts and ratios follows (dollars in millions):

     Table of Contents  

Sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents were as follows (in millions):   

  Operating Cash Flows 
  Cash flows from operations   increased   to approximately   $689 million   in   2016   from   $659 million   in the comparable prior-year period primarily due to the impact of settlement collections from McMoRan and Cobalt, partially offset by an increase in payments related to accounts payable, a decrease in cash receipts from accounts receivable as well as lower activity. 
  We have not provided deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of its non-U.K. subsidiaries, including RCI's non-U.S. subsidiaries. It is our policy and intention to permanently reinvest earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries of RCI outside the U.S. Generally, earnings of non-U.K. subsidiaries in which RCI does not have a direct or indirect ownership interest can be distributed to the Company without imposition of either U.K. or local country tax. 
  As of December 31, 2015, RCI's portion of the unremitted earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries that could be includable in taxable income of RCI, if distributed, was approximately $336.8 million. Should the non-U.S. subsidiaries of RCI make a distribution from these earnings, we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings, and RCI's non-U.S. subsidiaries have no plan to distribute earnings in a manner that would cause them to be subject to U.S., U.K. or other local country taxation. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , RCI s non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $280 million of the   $1,038 million   of consolidated cash and cash equivalents. Management believes the Company has significant net assets, liquidity, contract backlog and/or other financial resources available to meet its operational and capital investment requirements and otherwise allow the Company to continue to maintain its policy of reinvesting such undistributed earnings outside the U.K. and U.S. indefinitely. 
  Backlog  
  Our backlog by geographic area as of the date of our most recent Fleet Status Report is presented below (in millions): 

39 

     Table of Contents  

We estimate our backlog will be realized as follows (in millions): 

Our contract backlog represents remaining contractual terms and may not reflect actual revenue due to renegotiations or factors such as rig downtime, estimated contract durations, customer concessions or contract cancellations.  
  About 61% of our remaining available rig days in 2016 and 49% of available rig days in 2017 were under contract or commitment as of   October 18, 2016  , excluding cold-stacked rigs. As of that date, we had three jack-ups that were cold-stacked, and seven jack-ups and one drillship that were available.  
  Since 2014, we have recognized asset impairment charges on several of our jack-up drilling units as a result of the decline in market conditions and the expectation of future demand and day rates. If market conditions deteriorate further, we could be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future periods. 
  Investing Activities  
  Capital expenditures for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , totaled   $88.5 million   and included the following: 
     $55.6 million for improvements to the existing fleet, including contractually required modifications; and 
     $32.9 million for rig equipment and other. 
  We currently estimate our   2016   capital expenditures to range from approximately $125-$130 million, primarily for fleet maintenance, rig equipment, spares and other. This amount excludes any contractual modifications that may arise due to our securing additional work. 
  We expect to fund our   2016   capital expenditures using available cash and cash flows from operations.  
  The capital budget reflects an appropriation of money that we may or may not spend, and the timing of such expenditures may change.  We will periodically review and adjust the capital budget as necessary based upon current and forecast cash flows and liquidity, anticipated market conditions in our business, the availability of financial resources, and alternative uses of capital to enhance shareholder value. 
  Financing Activities  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid $45.8 million in cash to retire $47.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 5% Notes due 2017 and 7.875% Notes due 2019, plus accrued interest, and recognized a $2.4 million gain on early extinguishment of debt. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.7 billion   principal amount of outstanding long-term debt consisting of   $357.7 million   principal amount of 5% Senior Notes due September 2017;   $396.5 million   principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes due 2019;   $700.0 million   principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2022;   $400.0 million   aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2024;   $400.0 million   principal amount of 5.4% Senior Notes due 2042; and   $400.0 million   aggregate principal amount of 5.85% Senior Notes due 2044 (together, the  Senior Notes ). The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior and unsecured basis by Rowan plc. 
  Interest payments on the Senior Notes are currently approximately $150 million annually, after giving effect to the repurchases made to date. No principal payments are required until each series  final maturity date, although we may make additional repurchases depending on market prices and the availability of cash. Management believes that cash flows from operating activities, existing cash balances, and amounts available under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy the Company s cash requirements for the following twelve months.

Restrictive provisions in the Company s bank credit facility agreement limit consolidated debt to 60% of book capitalization. Our consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio at   September 30, 2016   was   34%  . 
  Other provisions of our debt agreements limit the ability of the Company to create liens that secure debt, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate with another company and, in the event of noncompliance, restrict investment activities and asset purchases and sales, among other things. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants at   September 30, 2016  , and expects to remain in compliance over the following twelve months. 
  Letters of credit    
  We periodically employ letters of credit in the normal course of our business, and had outstanding letters of credit of approximately   $9.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES 
  The Company s significant accounting policies are presented in Note 2 of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K. These policies, and management judgments, assumptions and estimates made in their application underlie reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and management estimates involve carrying values of long-lived assets, pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs (specifically, assumptions used in actuarial calculations), and income taxes (particularly our estimated reserves for uncertain tax positions). Changes in such policies and/or estimates would produce significantly different amounts from those reported herein. 
  We recorded asset impairments, other postretirement benefit plan changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (See Notes 3, 4, 7 and  9 of the  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  in Item 1 of PART I of this Quarterly Report). Other than these items, there were no material changes to the judgments, assumptions or policies upon which our critical accounting estimates were based during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  See Note 1 of the  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  in Item 1 of PART I of this Quarterly Report. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Interest rate risk       Our outstanding debt at   September 30, 2016  , consisted entirely of fixed-rate debt with a carrying value of   $2.646 billion   and a weighted-average annual interest rate of 5.6%. Due to the fixed-rate nature of our debt, management believes the risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates is not material. 
  Currency exchange rate risk       A substantial majority of our revenues are received in U.S. dollars, which is our functional currency.  However, in certain countries in which we operate, local laws or contracts may require us to receive some payment in the local currency. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk to the extent the amount of our monetary assets denominated in the foreign currency differs from our obligations in that foreign currency. In order to mitigate the effect of exchange rate risk, we attempt to limit foreign currency holdings to the extent they are needed to pay liabilities in the local currency. In the past, we have entered into spot purchases or short-term derivative transactions, such as forward exchange contracts, with one-month durations. We did not enter into such transactions for the purpose of speculation, trading or investing in the market and we believe that our use of forward exchange contracts has not exposed us to material credit risk or other material market risk. Although our risk policy allows us to enter into such forward exchange contracts, we do not currently anticipate entering into such transactions in the future and had no such contracts outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Commodity price risk       Fluctuating commodity prices affect our future earnings materially to the extent that they influence demand for our products and services.

Fair Value Derivative Asset       At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Contingent Payment Derivative was   $4.2 million  . We estimate the fair value of this instrument using Monte Carlo simulation which takes into account a variety of factors including the Price Targets, the WTI Spot price, the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate, the slope of the WTI forward curve, and the remaining contractual term of the FMOG Provision. We are required to revalue this asset each quarter. We believe that the assumptions that have the greatest impact on the determination of fair value is the WTI Spot Price on the valuation date and the expected volatility. The following table illustrates the potential effect on the fair value of the derivative asset at   September 30, 2016   from changes in the assumptions made which would lower the fair value (in millions): 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  There have been no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.  Legal Proceedings       
  There were no new material legal proceedings filed during the quarter, nor any material developments to proceedings reported in prior periods. 
   
  Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
  There are numerous factors that affect our business and results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. Security holders and potential investors in our securities should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , in addition to other information in such annual report and in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. These risk factors are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated or expected.   
  A further decline in the market for contract drilling services could result in additional asset impairment charges.  
  We recognized asset impairment charges on our jack-up drilling units aggregating approximately $566 million in 2014, $330 million in 2015, and $34 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, or approximately 7%, 4% and 0.5%, respectively, of our fixed asset carrying values. Prolonged periods of low utilization and day rates, the cold-stacking of idle assets, or the sale of assets below their then carrying value could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges on our drilling units if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. See "Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" in Note 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and "Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis" in Note 7 of the  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  in Item 1 of PART I of this Quarterly Report.

(1) The total number of shares acquired reflects shares acquired from employees by an affiliated employee benefit trust (EBT) upon forfeiture of nonvested awards or in satisfaction of tax withholding requirements. The price paid for shares acquired as a result of forfeitures is the par value of $0.125 per share. The price paid for shares acquired in satisfaction of withholding taxes is the share price on the date of the transaction. In February 2015, we issued 1.1 million shares to the EBT, which shares were acquired at a price equal to the par value of $0.125 per share. There were no shares repurchased under any share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2016. 
      (2) The ability to make share repurchases is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and the limitations set forth in the Companies Act, which generally provide that share repurchases may only be made out of distributable reserves. In addition, U.K. law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares through  off market purchases  without the prior approval of shareholders, which approval is valid for a maximum period of five years. Prior to and in connection with the redomestication, we obtained approval to purchase our own shares. To effect such repurchases, we entered into a purchase agreement with a specified dealer in July 2012, pursuant to which we may purchase up to a maximum of 50,000,000 shares over a five-year period, subject to an annual cap of 10% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of each applicable year. Subject to Board approval, share repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice and, in accordance with the shareholder approval and U.K. law, any shares repurchased by us will be cancelled. This authority to repurchase shares terminates in April 2017 unless otherwise reapproved by our shareholders prior to that time. U.K. law prohibits us from conducting  on market purchases  because our shares are not traded on a recognized investment exchange in the U.K.
