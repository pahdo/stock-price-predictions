Note 1 Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of
Straight Path Communications Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Straight Path ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information
and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting
of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three
months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending July 31,
2017. The balance sheet at July 31, 2016 has been derived from Straight Path s audited financial statements at that date
but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. For further
information, please refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in Straight Path s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC ). 

Straight Path Communications Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated
in April 2013. Straight Path owns 100% of Straight Path Spectrum, Inc. ( Straight Path Spectrum ) and Straight Path
Ventures, LLC ( Straight Path Ventures ), and 84.5% of Straight Path IP Group, Inc. ( Straight Path IP Group ).
In these financial statements, the terms  the Company,   Straight Path,   we,   us, 
and  our  refer to Straight Path, Straight Path Spectrum, Straight Path Ventures, Straight Path IP Group, and their
respective subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The Company was formerly a subsidiary of IDT Corporation ( IDT ).
On July 31, 2013, the Company was spun-off by IDT to its stockholders and became an independent public company (the  Spin-Off ).
The Company authorized the issuance of two classes of its common stock, Class A ( Class A common stock ) and Class
B ( Class B common stock ). 

The Company s fiscal year ends on July 31 of each calendar
year. Each reference below to a fiscal year refers to the fiscal year ending in the calendar year indicated (e.g., Fiscal 2017
refers to the fiscal year ending July 31, 2017). 

Note
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Pronouncements   

The Company s significant accounting policies are described
in Note 1 of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year  ended
July 31, 2016.  

In May 2014, ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts
with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ) was issued. The comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue
recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts
that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance
will also require that certain contract costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract, such as sales commissions, be capitalized
as an asset and amortized as revenue is recognized. Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of both revenue recognition
and the incurrence of contract costs for certain transactions. The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring
retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the
new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. 

ASU 2014-09 was scheduled to be effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  R evenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective
Date   ( ASU 2015-14 ) which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. ASU 2014-09 is now effective
for annual reporting periods after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period.  Earlier application
is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within
that reporting period. The Company will adopt the new standard effective August 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of adoption and the implementation approach to be used. 

In June 2014, ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements
  Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  
( ASU 2014-15 ) was issued.  Before the issuance of ASU 2014-15, there was no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or
to provide related footnote disclosures. This guidance is expected to reduce the diversity in the timing and content of footnote
disclosures. ASU 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating
and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards as specified in the guidance. ASU 2014-15 becomes
effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 (Fiscal 2018 for the Company) and for annual and interim periods
thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2014-15 on its consolidated
financial statements but the adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial
statements. 

Effective August 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-01,   Income
Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the
Concept of Extraordinary Items   ( ASU 2015-01 ). ASU 2015-01 eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary
items. ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to
all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 did not have a significant impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

Effective August 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation
(Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-02 ). The amendments in ASU 2015-02 change
the analysis that reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The
amendments in ASU 2015-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments
in ASU 2015-02 using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning
of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did
not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Effective August 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03,   Interest
  Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 )
as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative). The Board received feedback
that having different balance sheet presentation requirements for debt issuance costs and debt discount and premium creates unnecessary
complexity. Recognizing debt issuance costs as a deferred charge (that is, an asset) also is different from the guidance in International
Financial Reporting Standards, which requires that transaction costs be deducted from the carrying value of the financial liability
and not recorded as separate assets. Additionally, the requirement to recognize debt issuance costs as deferred charges conflicts
with the guidance in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6,  Elements of Financial Statements,  which states that debt issuance
costs are similar to debt discounts and in effect reduce the proceeds of borrowing, thereby increasing the effective interest rate.
FASB Concepts Statement No. 6 further states that debt issuance costs cannot be an asset because they provide no future economic
benefit. To simplify presentation of debt issuance costs, the amendments in this Update require that debt issuance costs related
to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability,
consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments
in this Update. The amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial
Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  
( ASU 2016-01 ). The amendments require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair
value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result
in consolidation of the investee). The amendments also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the
portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when
the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments.
In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized
cost for entities that are not public business entities and the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions
used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance
sheet for public business entities. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (Fiscal 2019
for the Company), including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will evaluate the effects of adopting ASU 2016-01
if and when it is deemed to be applicable. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases
(Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ) which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in   Leases
(Topic 840) .   The standard requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the
balance sheet.  A lessee should recognize in the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and
a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  The new guidance is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (Fiscal 2020 for the Company) and interim periods within those fiscal
years. The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach
with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating
the effects of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements
to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 affects entities that issue share-based
payment awards to their employees. ASU 2016-09 is designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award
transactions which include   the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification
on the statement of cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016 (Fiscal 2018 for the Company), including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ( ASU 2016-10 )
related to identifying performance obligations and licensing. ASU 2016-10 is meant to clarify the guidance in FASB ASU 2014-09,
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers .  Specifically, ASU 2016-10 addresses an entity s identification
of its performance obligations in a contract, as well as an entity s evaluation of the nature of its promise to grant a license
of intellectual property and whether or not that revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time. The pronouncement has the
same effective date as the new revenue standard, which is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2017 (Fiscal 2019 for the Company). The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-10
on its consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ( ASU 2016-12 ).
The amendments in ASU 2016-12 affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09 by clarifying certain specific aspects of the guidance, including
assessment of collectability, treatment of sales taxes and contract modifications, and providing certain technical corrections.
ASU 2016-12 will have the same effective date and transition requirements as the ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of ASU 2016-12 on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU
2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of
cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (Fiscal 2019 for the Company). The new
standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required
to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating
the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,   Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash   ( ASU 2016-18 ). ASU 2016-18 require that a statement of cash
flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted
cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents
should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown
on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (Fiscal 2019 for the
Company). Early adoption is permitted. The Company will evaluate the effects of adopting ASU 2016-18 if and when it is deemed to
be applicable. 

The Company does not believe that any other recently issued, but
not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. 

Note 3  Fair Value Measures  

At October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016, the Company did not
have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

At October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016, the carrying amounts
of the financial instruments included in cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current
assets, trade accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximated fair value due to their short-term nature. 

Note 4 Equity  

Issuances of Class B Common Stock:   

Class B common stock activity
for the three months ended October 31, 2016 was as follows: 

1.  
      The Company issued 120,000 shares   to Davidi Jonas, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and President, as compensation.   

3.  
      The Company issued 1,250 shares to a consultant as compensation.   

See Note 5 - Stock-Based Compensation
below for a further discussion. 

Treasury Stock for Payroll Tax Withholding:  

Treasury stock consists of shares of Class B common stock that were
tendered by our employees to satisfy their tax withholding obligations in connection with the lapsing of restrictions on awards
of restricted stock. The cost of the shares tendered was based on the trading day immediately prior to the vesting date and the
proceeds utilized to pay the withholding taxes due upon such vesting event. 

At both October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016, there were 39,693 shares
of treasury stock totaling approximately $428,000. 

Note 5 Stock-Based Compensation  

Stock Options:   

Effective as of July 31, 2013, the Company adopted the 2013 Stock
Option and Incentive Plan (as amended and restated to date, the  2013 Plan ). As of January 12, 2016, there are 1,503,532
shares of the Company s Class B common stock reserved for the grant of awards under the 2013 Plan. 

No stock options were issued in the three months ended October 31,
2016. 

Stock-based compensation is included in selling, general and administrative
and amounted to approximately $97,000 and $0 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Common Stock:   

From time to time, the Company issues Class B common stock (and
options to purchase Class B common stock   options covered just above) to non-employee directors, officers, other employees,
and other service providers. 

Issuances of Class B common stock included in stock-based compensation
for the three months ended October 31, 2016 are as follows: 

In October 2016, the Company granted officers and
employees 164,000 restricted shares of Class B common stock. The shares will vest over a two-to-four-year period. The aggregate
fair value of the grant was approximately $4,392,000 which is being charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting
periods. 

In addition, in October 2016,
the Company issued 120,000 restricted shares of Class B common stock  to Davidi Jonas as compensation as follows: 

2.   60,000 shares which will vest over a three-year period. The aggregate fair value of the grant
was $1,866,000 which is being charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.    

The Company issued 1,250 restricted
shares of Class B common stock  to a consultant as compensation. The shares vest over a 13-month period.  The
aggregate fair value of the grant is being charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  

Stock-based compensation is included in selling, general and administrative
expense and amounted to approximately $2,417,000 and $598,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
As of October 31, 2016, there was approximately $8,030,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to issued but non-vested
restricted shares. The Company expects to recognize the unrecognized compensation cost as follows: Fiscal 2017 - $2,581,000, Fiscal
2018 - $2,781,000, Fiscal 2019 - $1,990,000, fiscal 2020 - $615,000 and Fiscal 2021 - $63,000. 

Note 6  (Loss) Earnings Per Share  

Basic (loss) earnings per share is computed by dividing net (loss)
income attributable to all classes of common stockholders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares of all classes
of common stock outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same manner as basic earnings
per share, except that the number of shares is increased to include restricted stock still subject to risk of forfeiture and to
assume exercise of potentially dilutive stock options using the treasury stock method, unless the effect of such increase would
be anti-dilutive. 

The following table sets forth the number of Class B shares of common
stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options which were excluded from the diluted per share calculation even though the exercise
price was less than the average market price of the Class B common shares and non-vested restricted Class B common stock because
the effect of including these potential shares was anti-dilutive due to the net loss incurred during that period: 

The following table sets forth the number of stock options to purchase
Class B common stock which were excluded from the diluted per share calculation because the exercise price was greater than the
average market price of the Class B common shares: 

Note 7 Related Party Transactions  

In connection with the Spin-Off, the Company and IDT entered into
a Separation and Distribution Agreement and a Tax Separation Agreement to complete the separation of the Company s businesses
from IDT, distribute the Company s common stock to IDT s stockholders, and set forth certain understandings related
to the Spin-Off. These agreements govern the relationship between the Company and IDT after the distribution and also provide for
the allocation of employee benefits, taxes, and other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the distribution.
These agreements reflect terms between affiliated parties established without arms-length negotiation. The Company believes that
the terms of these agreements equitably reflect the benefits and costs of the Company s ongoing relationships with IDT. 

Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company
has agreed to indemnify IDT and IDT has agreed to indemnify the Company for losses related to the failure of the other to pay,
perform, or otherwise discharge any of the liabilities and obligations set forth in the agreement. The Separation and Distribution
Agreement includes, among other things, that IDT is obligated to reimburse the Company for the payment of any liabilities of the
Company arising or related to the period prior to the Spin-Off. No payments were received in Fiscal 2016 or through October 31,
2016. 

At the Spin-Off, the Company entered into a Transition Services
Agreement ( TSA ) with IDT, pursuant to which IDT has provided certain services, including, but not limited to information
and technology, human resources, payroll, tax, accounts payable, purchasing, treasury, financial systems, investor relations, legal,
corporate accounting, internal audit, and facilities for an agreed period following the Spin-Off. As of January 1, 2015, all of
these services are provided by other vendors. The Company and IDT extended the TSA enabling the Company to seek input from IDT
on an ad hoc basis if the Company deemed it necessary. No services were provided under the TSA in the three months ended October
31, 2016 and 2015. 

Note 8 Concentration of Customers  

Straight Path Spectrum s revenues from transactions with a
single customer that amounted to 10% or more of total Straight Path Spectrum revenues were as follows: 

* below 10% 

The loss of any of these major customers may
have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and cash flows. 

Note 9 Income Taxes  

The Company recorded no federal income tax expense for Fiscal 2017
and Fiscal 2016 because the estimated annual effective tax rate was zero. As of October 31, 2016, the Company continues to provide
a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets since the Company believes it is more likely than not that its deferred
tax assets will not be realized. 

The provision for both the three months ended October 31, 2016 and
2015 represents state income taxes. 

The federal return of Straight Path for the year ended July 31,
2015 is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ). As the audit has not been completed, the Company
cannot determine if the IRS will assess additional tax, interest, and penalties. 

Note 10 Business Segment Information  

Prior to November 1, 2015, the Company had two reportable business
segments, Straight Path Spectrum, which holds, leases, and markets fixed wireless spectrum, and Straight Path IP Group, which holds
intellectual property primarily related to communications over computer networks, and the licensing and other businesses related
to this intellectual property. Effective November 1, 2015, a third segment, referred to as Straight Path Ventures, has been designated.
Straight Path Ventures focuses on developing next generation wireless technology for 39 GHz at the Company s Gigabit Mobility
Lab in Plano, Texas. 

The Company s reportable segments are distinguished by types
of service, customers, and methods used to provide their services. The operating results of these business segments are regularly
reviewed by the Company s chief operating decision maker. 

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as the accounting
policies of the Company as a whole. The Company evaluates the performance of its business segments based primarily on income (loss)
from operations. There are no significant asymmetrical allocations to segments. 

The Company allocates all of the corporate general and administrative
expenses of Straight Path to Straight Path IP Group, Straight Path Spectrum, and Straight Path Ventures based upon the relative
time of management and other corporate resources expended relative to each business as well as the revenues earned by each division.
For all periods through January 31, 2016, these were allocated 80% to Straight Path IP Group and 20% to Straight Path Spectrum.
No expenses were allocated to Straight Path Ventures because they were deemed to be immaterial. Commencing on February 1, 2016,
these expenses are being allocated 20% to Straight Path IP Group and 80% to Straight Path Spectrum, except for the following: expenses
related to the Gigabit Mobility Lab are being allocated 100% to Straight Path Ventures; employment expenses of our Chief Technology
Officer are being allocated 20% to Straight Path IP Group, 20% to Straight Path Spectrum, and 60% to Straight Path Ventures; and
employment expenses related to another employee are being allocated 20% to Straight Path Spectrum and 80% to Straight Path Ventures.
The changes in allocations were brought about by the expiration of the licensed patents held by Straight Path IP Group and the
increase in activities of Straight Path Ventures. Straight Path IP Group has been recognizing revenues over the terms of the settlements
and license agreements related to such patents entered into in prior periods. With the expiration of the key patents and the increase
in activities of Straight Path Ventures, the Company determined to modify the allocation, and in light of the anticipated level
of activity in Straight Path IP Group s enforcement activities and Straight Path Ventures  development activities,
the Company determined that a general 20% allocation to Straight Path IP Group, subject to the specific allocations listed above,
represented the appropriate split in light of all factors. 

Operating results for the business segments of the Company were
as follows: 

Total assets for the business segments of the Company were as follows: 

None of the Company s revenues were generated outside of the
United States for either Fiscal 2017 or Fiscal 2016. The Company did not have any assets outside the United States at October 31,
2016 or July 31, 2016. 

Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies  

Legal Proceedings  

Regulatory Enforcement  

Allegations were made in an anonymous report released in November
2015 regarding the circumstances under which certain of our spectrum licenses were renewed by the Federal Communications Commission
(the  FCC  or the  Commission ) in 2011 and 2012. The Company retained Morgan Lewis, a leading multi-national
law firm, to conduct an independent investigation into these allegations. Morgan Lewis, with assistance from Kroll, completed its
investigation and reported the results to the Company. We met with the FCC and shared the investigators  conclusions, and
the Company subsequently provided certain additional information requested by the FCC. On September 20, 2016, the Company received
a letter of inquiry from the FCC requesting additional documents and information regarding the Registrant s 39 GHz (38.6
  40.0 GHz) and 28 GHz (27.5   28.35 GHz) spectrum licenses. Straight Path intends to continue to cooperate with the
FCC in this matter, and hopes to bring it to a satisfactory resolution in a timely manner. We cannot, at this time, give any assurances
as to how the FCC may proceed in this matter. If the FCC were to conclude that we have not complied with its rules, it may impose
fines and/or additional reporting or operational requirements, condition or revoke our licenses, and/or take other action. If the
FCC were to revoke a significant portion of our licenses or impose material conditions on the use of our licenses, it could have
a material adverse effect on the value of our spectrum licenses and our ability to generate revenues from utilization of our spectrum
assets. 

Putative Class Action  

On November 13, 2015, a putative shareholder class action was filed
in the federal district court for the District of New Jersey against Straight Path Communications Inc., and Davidi Jonas and Jonathan
Rand (the  individual defendants ). The case is captioned  Zacharia v. Straight Path Communications, Inc. et al. ,
No. 2:15-cv-08051-JMV-MF, and is purportedly brought on behalf of all those who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company s
common stock between October 29, 2013, and November 5, 2015. The complaint alleges violations of (i) Section 10(b) of the Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act against the Company for materially
false and misleading statements that were designed to influence the market relating to the Company s finances and business
prospects; and (ii) Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants for wrongful acts by controlling persons.
The allegations center on the claim that the Company made materially false and misleading statements in its public filings and
conference calls during the relevant class period concerning the Company s spectrum licenses and the prospects for its spectrum
business. The complaint seeks certification of a class, unspecified damages, fees, and costs. The case was reassigned to Judge
John Michael Vasquez on March 3, 2016. On April 11, 2016, the court entered an order appointing Charles Frischer as lead plaintiff
and approving lead plaintiff s selection of Glancy Prongay   Murray LLP as lead counsel and Schnader Harrison Segal  
Lewis LLP as liaison counsel. On June 17, 2016, lead plaintiff filed his amended class action complaint, which alleges the same
claims described above. The defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the complaint on August 17, 2016; the plaintiff opposed
that motion on September 30, 2016, and the defendants filed their reply brief in further support of their motion to dismiss on
October 31, 2016. 

On January 29, 2016, a shareholder derivative action captioned  Hofer
v. Jonas et al. , No. 2:16-cv-00541-JMV-MF, was filed in the federal district court for the District of New Jersey against Howard
Jonas, Davidi Jonas, Jonathan Rand, and the Company s current independent directors William F. Weld, K. Chris Todd, and Fred
S. Zeidman. Although the Company is named as a nominal defendant, the Company s bylaws generally require the Company to indemnify
its current and former directors and officers who are named as defendants in these types of lawsuits. The allegations are substantially
similar to those set forth in the  Zacharia  complaint discussed above. The complaint alleges that the defendants engaged
in (i) breach of fiduciary duties owed to the Company by making misrepresentations and omissions about the Company and failing
to correct the Company s public statements; (ii) abuse of control of the Company; (iii) gross mismanagement of the Company;
and (iv) unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, fees, and costs, as well as injunctive relief. On April 26,
2016, the case was reassigned to Judge John Michael Vasquez. On June 9, 2016, the court entered a stipulation previously agreed
to by the parties that, among other things, stays the case on terms specified therein. 

The Company is aware of press reports regarding the filing of additional
complaints for putative class actions revolving around the same alleged facts and circumstances as the  Zacharia  and  Hofer 
complaints, but the Company is not aware of any other complaint that was filed or served. 

The Company intends to vigorously defend against all of these claims. 

Sipnet Appeal and Related IPRs  

On April 11, 2013, Sipnet EU S.R.O. ( Sipnet ), a Czech
company, filed a petition for an  inter partes  review ( IPR ) at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the United
States Patent and Trademark Office (the  PTAB ) for certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,108,704 (the   704
Patent ). On October 9, 2014, the PTAB held that claims 1-7 and 32-42 of the  704 Patent are unpatentable. Straight
Path IP Group appealed. On November 25, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the  CAFC ) reversed
the PTAB s cancellation of all challenged claims, and remanded the matter back to the PTAB for proceedings consistent with
the CAFC s opinion. On May 23, 2016, the PTAB issued a final written decision finding that Sipnet failed to show that any
of the challenged claims were unpatentable. 

As discussed in more detail below, following the CAFC s decision
in Sipnet, the PTAB denied all then-pending petitions for IPR of Straight Path IP Group s patents, and the petitioners have
appealed those denials to the CAFC. 

On August 22, 2014, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. ( Samsung )
filed three petitions with the PTAB for IPR of certain claims of the  704 Patent and U.S. Patent Nos. 6,009,469 (the   469
Patent ) and 6,131,121 (the   121 Patent ). On March 6, 2015, the PTAB instituted the requested IPR. On
June 15, 2015, Cisco Systems, Inc. ( Cisco ) and Avaya, Inc. ( Avaya ) joined this instituted IPR. On March
4, 2016, the PTAB issued a final written decision holding that Samsung failed to show that any claims of the  704 and  121
Patents were unpatentable. The PTAB also held that Samsung failed to show that the majority of the claims of the  469 Patent
were unpatentable. On May 5, 2016, Samsung filed a notice of appeal to the CAFC. On May 6, 2016, Cisco and Avaya also filed notices
of appeal. 

On October 31, 2014, LG Electronics Inc. et al. ( LG ),
Toshiba Corporation et al. ( Toshiba ), Vizio, Inc. ( Vizio ), and Hulu LLC ( Hulu ) filed
three petitions with the PTAB for IPR of certain claims of the  704,  469, and  121 Patents. On May 15, 2015,
the PTAB instituted the requested IPRs. On November 10, 2015, the PTAB granted petitions filed by Cisco and Avaya to join these
IPRs. On November 24, 2015, the PTAB granted related petitions filed by Verizon Services Corp. and Verizon Business Network Services
Inc. (the  Verizon affiliates ) to join for the  704 and  469 Patents. On May 9, 2016, the PTAB issued
a final written decision holding that the petitioners failed to show that any claims of the  704 Patent were unpatentable.
The PTAB also held that the petitioners failed to show that the majority of the claims of the  469 and  121 Patents
were unpatentable. On May 20, 2016, the petitioners filed a notice of appeal to the CAFC, and this appeal was consolidated with
the appeal of the Samsung IPR discussed above. On October 14, 2016, the appellants filed their opening brief. The respondents filed
their opposition brief on December 7, 2016, and the appellants  reply brief is due on December 28, 2016. 

On September 28, 2015, Cisco, Avaya, and the Verizon affiliates
filed a petition for an IPR with the PTAB for all claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,701,365 (the   365 Patent ). On
April 6, 2016, the PTAB denied the petition, finding that the petitioners had not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood that any
challenged claim was unpatentable. This decision was not appealed to the CAFC. 

Patent Enforcement  

Following the CAFC s decision in Sipnet and the PTAB s
decisions in the related IPRs, Straight Path IP Group has taken steps to re-commence its patent enforcement actions in federal
district court that had been stayed or dismissed without prejudice during the pendency of the Sipnet Appeal and related IPRs. 

On August 1, 2013, Straight Path IP Group filed complaints in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against LG, Toshiba, and Vizio alleging infringement of the  704,
 469, and  121 Patents and seeking damages related to such infringement. The actions were consolidated (the  consolidated
action ) and assigned to Judge Anthony J. Trenga. In October 2014, Hulu intervened in the consolidated action as to Hulu s
streaming functionality in the accused products. In that same month, Amazon.com, Inc. ( Amazon ) moved to intervene,
sever, and stay claims related to Amazon s streaming functionality in the accused products. On October 13, 2014, Amazon filed
an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California seeking declaratory relief of non-infringement
of the  704,  469, and  121 Patents based in part on the allegations related to the consolidated action in Virginia
(the  Amazon action ). On December 5, 2014, Straight Path IP Group filed a motion to dismiss Amazon s complaint,
or in the alternative, to transfer venue to the Eastern District of Virginia. On May 28, 2015, the California court transferred
the Amazon action to Virginia, and the Virginia court later formally severed the Amazon action from the consolidated action. In
November 2014, the parties jointly moved to stay the consolidated action and the Amazon action pending the completion of the Sipnet
Appeal and related IPRs. On November 4, 2014, the court granted the stay. On May 23, 2016, Straight Path IP Group filed status
reports with the court in both the consolidated action and the Amazon action requesting that the stay be lifted, and the defendants
filed a statement and request for leave to file a motion to continue the stay. The court held oral argument, and on August 8, 2016,
the court continued the stay pending the outcome of the defendants  appeals of the PTAB s denial of their IPRs. 

On August 23, 2013, Straight Path IP Group filed a complaint in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Samsung alleging infringement of the  704,  469,
and  121 Patents and seeking damages related to such infringement. In September 2014, Straight Path IP Group and Samsung
jointly filed a motion to stay the action. On October 29, 2014, the court granted the motion and stayed the action pending the
outcome of the Sipnet Appeal and the Samsung IPR petitions. On May 31, 2016, Straight Path IP Group filed a notice informing the
court of the results of the Samsung IPR and the Sipnet Appeal and requesting that the stay be lifted. On June 2, 2016, the defendants
filed a notice asserting that the stay should remain pending their appeal of the PTAB s decision in the Samsung IPR.  The
court has not ruled on Straight Path IP Group s request. 

On September 24, 2014, Straight Path IP Group filed complaints against
each of Apple, Inc. ( Apple ), Avaya, and Cisco in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
Straight Path IP Group claims that (a) Apple s telecommunications products, including FaceTime software, infringe four of
Straight Path IP Group s patents (the  704,  469, and  121 Patents and U.S. Patent No. 7,149,208); (b)
Avaya s IP telephony, video conference, and telepresence products such as its Aura Platform infringe four of the Straight
Path IP Group s patents (the  704,  469,  121, and  365 Patents); and (c) Cisco s IP telephony,
video conference, and telepresence products such as the Unified Communications Solutions infringe four of Straight Path IP Group s
patents (the  704,  469,  121, and  365 Patents). On December 24, 2014, Straight Path IP Group dismissed
the complaints against Avaya and Cisco without prejudice. On January 5, 2015, Straight Path IP Group dismissed the complaint against
Apple without prejudice. On June 21, 2016, Straight Path IP Group filed new complaints against Avaya and Cisco alleging that certain
of their products infringe four of Straight Path IP Group s patents. On August 5, 2016, Avaya filed its answer, affirmative
defenses, and counterclaims for declaratory judgments of noninfringement and invalidity of Straight Path IP Group s patents,
and the parties have commenced discovery. Also on August 5, 2016, Cisco filed its answer and affirmative defenses, and the parties
have commenced discovery. On June 24, 2016, Straight Path IP Group filed a new complaint against Apple alleging that its FaceTime
product infringes five of Straight Path IP Group s patents. On August 5, 2016, Apple filed a partial motion to dismiss as
well as its answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaims for declaratory judgments of noninfringement and invalidity of Straight
Path IP Group s patents, and the parties have commenced discovery. Following oral argument, on October 21, 2016, the court
granted in part and denied in part Apple s motion. The court dismissed one claim as to the  469 Patent but denied Apple s
motion with respect to the other four patents at issue in the litigation. 

On September 26, 2014, Straight Path IP Group filed a complaint
against the Verizon affiliates and Verizon Communications in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. Straight Path IP Group claims the defendants  telephony products such as its Advanced Communications Products, including
Unified Communications and Collaboration and VOIP infringe on the  704,  469, and  365 Patents. On November 24,
2014, Straight Path IP Group dismissed the complaint without prejudice subject to a confidential standstill agreement with the
defendants. On June 7, 2016, Straight Path IP Group filed a new complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York against the original Verizon parties as well as Verizon affiliate Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless,
alleging that defendants  IP telephony products such as FIOS Digital Voice, Unified Communications and Collaboration, Verizon
Enterprise Solutions VoIP, Virtual Communications Express, Voice over LTE, and related hardware and software infringe the  704,
 469 and  365 Patents. On August 5, 2016, Verizon filed its answer and affirmative defenses, and the parties commenced
discovery. On September 13, 2016, Verizon filed a motion to stay the litigation pending a decision from the CAFC in the appeal
of the Samsung IPR. On October 18, 2016, the court granted Verizon s motion and stayed the litigation. 

Straight Path IP Group generally pays law firms that represent it
in litigation against alleged infringers of its intellectual property rights a percentage of the amounts recovered ranging from
0% to 40% depending on several factors. 

Other Legal  

In addition to the foregoing, the Company may from time to time
be subject to other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.  

Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) License
Renewal   

Our spectrum licenses in the local multipoint distribution
service ( LMDS ) and 39 GHz bands have historically been granted for ten-year terms. On April 20, 2016, the FCC granted
our application to renew our LMDS BTA license for the LMDS A1 band (27.5   28.35 GHz) that covers parts of the New York City
BTA for a ten-year period, until February 1, 2026. We have 15 other LMDS A1 licenses; nine of these licenses currently have a renewal
date of August 10, 2018, and six of these licenses have a renewal date of September 21, 2018. However, following the adoption of
the Upper Microwave Flexible Use ( UMFU ) Report and Order, the next build-out date for these 16 LMDS A1 licenses is
June 1, 2024, not at the renewal deadline. 

It is likely that the FCC will separate the renewal and build-out
deadlines for licenses that contain both A1 spectrum (for which mobile capabilities were adopted in the UMFU Report and Order)
and A2 and A3 spectrum (for which mobile capabilities were not added). Of the 15 BTAs in which we hold LMDS A2 band (29.1  
29.25 GHz) and A3 band (31.075   31.225 GHz) spectrum, nine licenses currently have a renewal and possible build-out date
of August 10, 2018 and six of these licenses currently have a renewal and possible build-out date of September 21, 2018. The UMFU
Report and Order does not affect the LMDS B band spectrum. Of our 117 LMDS B band (31.0   31.075 GHz and 31.225   31.300
GHz) spectrum, five licenses currently have a renewal and build-out date of August 10, 2018 and 112 licenses currently have a renewal
and build-out date of September 21, 2018. 

The UMFU Report and Order build-out date of June 1, 2024 also applies
to our 828 39 GHz licenses, which currently have a renewal date of October 18, 2020. 

For further discussion, please see   Regulatory Enforcement  
above in this Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Other Commitments and Contingencies    

The former Chief Executive Officer of Straight Path Spectrum (the
 Former SPSI CEO ) is entitled to receive payments from future revenues generated from the leasing, licensing
or sale of rights in certain of Straight Path Spectrum s wireless spectrum licenses. Those payments are to be made out of
50% of the covered revenue and are in a maximum aggregate amount of $3.25 million. The payments arise under the June 2013 settlement
of certain claims and disputes with the Former SPSI CEO and parties related to the Former SPSI CEO. 

Approximately $71,000 and $3,000 was incurred to the Former
SPSI CEO for this obligation for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively.

Overview  

We were formerly a subsidiary of IDT Corporation
( IDT ). On July 31, 2013, we were spun-off from IDT to its stockholders and became an independent public company (the
 Spin-Off ). 

Straight Path Communications Inc. is a communications
asset company. We own, via intermediate wholly-owned entities, 100% of Straight Path Spectrum, Inc. ( Straight Path Spectrum )
and 100% of Straight Path Ventures, LLC ( Straight Path Ventures ), and we own 84.5% of Straight Path IP Group, Inc.
( Straight Path IP Group ). 

Straight Path Spectrum s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Straight Path Spectrum, LLC, holds, leases, and markets fixed wireless spectrum. Straight Path Ventures is developing
next generation wireless technology for 39 GHz. Straight Path IP Group owns intellectual property primarily related to communications
over the Internet, and the licensing and other businesses related to this intellectual property.   

Recent Activity Related to Straight Path
Spectrum  

Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) advances
approval of mobile services in millimeter wave ( mmW ) bands, including adopting the Upper Microwave Flexible Use ( UMFU )
Report and Order  

We hold a significant number of FCC licenses that permit
the use of the spectrum for fixed and mobile wireless services in the United States, providing broad geographic coverage and a
large amount of total bandwidth in many areas. These include licenses in what are known as the 39 GHz band (38.6   40 GHz)
and the 28 GHz A1 band (27.5   28.35 GHz). We also hold FCC licenses that permit the use of the spectrum for fixed wireless
services in other parts of the LMDS band (29.1   29.25 GHz, 31.075   31.225 GHz, 31.0   31.075 GHz and 31.225
  31.300 GHz). Our 39 GHz spectrum licenses cover the entire continental U.S. with an average of more than 800 megahertz
( MHz ) of bandwidth in the top 30 U.S. markets (measured by population according to the 2010 U.S. Census), as well
as LMDS licenses in many key markets. The FCC initially allocated these frequency bands for fixed and mobile services, but established
rules only for fixed services. 

On July 14, 2016, the FCC adopted the UMFU Report and Order,
which opens four millimeter wave bands for flexible mobile and fixed wireless services. The rules apply to the LMDS A1 and 39 GHz
bands, and a new unlicensed band at 60 GHz (64.0-71.0 GHz). Among other things, the UMFU Report and Order changed the build-out
date for our 828 39 GHz licenses and our 16 LMDS A1 licenses to June 1, 2024. 

On September 20, 2016, the Company received a letter of inquiry
from the FCC requesting additional documents and information regarding the Company s 39 GHz (38.6   40.0 GHz) and 28
GHz (27.5   28.35 GHz) spectrum licenses. For further discussion of this inquiry, please see Item 1A to Part I  Risk
Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2016 and the discussion under the heading  Regulatory
Enforcement  above. 

Straight Path is also participating in standard setting,
namely through 3GPP, as a contributing member. 

Innovation in Fixed Wireless Applications: Accelerating
Point-to-Multipoint ( PMP ) Platform in 39 GHz  

On September 11, 2015, Straight Path entered into an agreement
with Cambridge Broadband Networks Ltd. ( CBNL ) to expedite production of a 39 GHz PMP radio. Straight Path agreed
to a $1,000,000 non-recurring engineering investment ( NRE ), and the product is expected to be commercially available
by late 2016 or early 2017. 

In November 2016, the FCC approved CBNL s 39 GHz VectaStar    600
PMP radios for commercial use in the U.S. This enables Straight Path to take next steps with CBNL, including increased marketing and
testing, as U.S. wireless operators can now begin to deploy the live radios utilizing the Company s spectrum. 

Straight Path recently entered into a multiyear spectrum
lease agreement with Windstream, a nationwide advanced network communications provider, to lease 39 GHz spectrum in 40 markets
for use with CBNL VectaStar 39 GHz licensed PMP radios once they are commercially released. We anticipate this agreement will have
a meaningful impact on our revenue once the CBNL radios are deployed in these markets. 

Deployment of Currently Available Technology at 39 GHz
to Engage Broad Customer Base  

The Company purchased approximately $1.4 million of currently
available technology at 39 GHz to deploy through independent wireless operators in order to engage a broad customer base in advance
of our deployment of the CBNL PMP radios when they become commercially available in late 2016 or early 2017. The Company signed
a purchase order to CBNL for the acquisition of 500 PMP radios for $2,100,000 and has paid a deposit of $630,000. The Company expects
to receive 250 of the PMP radios in early 2017, and pay approx. $420,000 upon proof of shipment to the Company.  

Recent Activity Related to Straight Path
Ventures  

Straight Path Ventures is developing next generation
wireless technology primarily for 39 GHz at its Gigabit Mobility Lab in Plano, Texas. Although work is at an early stage, the Company
decided in Q3 2016 that this activity warrants a separate reportable business segment. 

On August 22, 2016, Straight Path Ventures
filed a provisional patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) for new 39 GHz
transceiver technology. On October 12, 2016, Straight Path Ventures filed a second provisional patent application with the USPTO
for new 39 GHz transceiver technology. 

On September 19, 2016, Straight Path Ventures
performed an indoor demonstration using our prototype 39 GHz Gigarray    transceivers. 

Recent Activity Related to Straight Path
IP Group  

On October 9, 2014, the Patent Trial and Appeals Board of the United
States Patent and Trademark Office (the  PTAB ) issued an administrative decision stating that claims 1-7 and 32-42
of U.S. Patent No. 6,108,704 (the   704 Patent ) are unpatentable. Straight Path IP Group appealed that decision.
On November 25, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the  CAFC ) reversed the PTAB s decision
and remanded the case back to the PTAB for further proceedings. On May 23, 2016, the PTAB issued a final written decision finding
none of the challenged claims unpatentable. 

Following the favorable CAFC decision, the PTAB denied pending petitions
for  inter partes  review ( IPR ) of the  704 Patent and other patents held by Straight Path IP Group. As
well, the PTAB found nearly all the claims patentable over the prior art in pending IPRs. The petitioners have appealed to the
CAFC. 

In civil actions pending in federal district courts for the Eastern
District of Virginia and Eastern District of Texas, Straight Path IP Group has requested that the courts lift the stays previously
put in place pending the outcome of the IPRs. The Eastern District of Virginia denied the request and continued the stay pending
a decision on the CAFC appeal. The Eastern District of Texas has not yet ruled. Straight Path IP Group has filed a complaint for
patent infringement against several Verizon affiliates in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, but the
court granted Verizon s motion to stay the litigation pending the outcome of the CAFC appeal. Straight Path IP Group has
also filed complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Apple, Inc., Avaya Inc., and Cisco
Systems, Inc. 

For further discussion of these actions and other legal proceedings,
please see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I of this Quarterly Report. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. Our significant
accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended July 31, 2016. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most subjective or complex judgments,
often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Our critical accounting policy
relates to the valuation of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical
experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. For additional discussion of our critical accounting policies, see our Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July
31, 2016 and the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 

Emerging Growth Company  

We qualify as an  emerging growth company  as defined
in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting
and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: 

an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies; and   

an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant
to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.   

We may take advantage of these provisions until the end of the fiscal
year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial registration statement filed related to our spin-off from IDT, which is
July 31, 2017, or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company and, if we do, the information that we provide
stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public companies in which you hold equity. We would cease to be
an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of
our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. 

The JOBS Act permits an  emerging growth company  like
us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. 

Concentration of Customers  

Straight Path Spectrum s revenues from transactions with a
single customer that amounted to 10% or more of total Straight Path Spectrum revenues were as follows: 

* below 10% 

The loss of any of these major customers may have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and cash flows. 

Results of Operations  

We evaluate the performance of our operating business segments based
primarily on income (loss) from operations. Accordingly, the income and expense line items below income (loss) from operations
are only included in our discussion of the consolidated results of operations. 

Three Months Ended October 31, 2016 ( Fiscal 2017 )
Compared to Three Months Ended October 31, 2015 ( Fiscal 2016 )  

Consolidated   

Revenues.  Revenues generated by Straight Path Spectrum were
$159,000 and $105,000 in Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively. Revenues increased in Fiscal 2017 as the result of the leasing
of Spectrum to new customers (wireless network operators). 

No revenues were generated by Straight Path IP Group in fiscal 2017
due to the fact that no new licenses or settlements were entered into and the revenue from prior licenses were fully realized in
prior periods due to the expiration of the licensed patents. Primarily all of the revenue was recognized as of September 30, 2015. 

No revenues were generated by Straight Path Ventures in fiscal 2017. 

Direct cost of revenues . Direct cost of revenues decreased
in Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016. 

In Fiscal 2017, Straight Path IP Group had no revenues because all
licenses or settlements were fully realized in prior periods. The Straight Path IP Group direct cost of revenues were costs related
to enforcement efforts and litigation settlements and licensing arrangements, increased generally proportionally to the increase
in settlement revenues, and are recognized over the same time period as corresponding revenues. 

Straight Path Spectrum incurred all of the direct costs of revenue
in Fiscal 2017. Direct cost of revenues includes governmental fees and connectivity costs. No such costs were incurred in Fiscal
2016. 

Research and development . Research and development in Fiscal
2017 consists of expenses related to development by our Gigabit Mobility Lab of next generation wireless technology for 39 GHz.
There were no research and development costs in Fiscal 2016. 

Selling, general and administrative expense .   Selling,
general and administrative expense increased in Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the increase in the
number of employees and increases in salaries, an increase of non-cash stock-based compensation charges related to the issuances
of restricted common stock to employees, marketing expenses related to the installation of radio links, and increased legal costs
due to the putative shareholder class action, derivative action, and regulatory enforcement activity. 

Stock-based compensation expense related to the issuance of restricted
shares included in consolidated selling, general and administrative expense was $2,417,000 and $598,000 in Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal
2016, respectively. As of October 31, 2016, there was approximately $8,030,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related
to non-vested restricted shares. The Company expects to recognize the unrecognized compensation cost as follows: Fiscal 2017 -
$2,581,000, Fiscal 2018 - $2,781,000, Fiscal 2019 - $1,990,000, Fiscal 2020 - $615,000 and Fiscal 2021 - $63,000. 

Interest and other income.   Interest and other income
in Fiscal 2017 included interest income of $7,000 and the reversal of prior period accruals of $22,000. Interest and other income
in Fiscal 2016 is interest income of $10,000. 

Income taxes.  The Company recorded no
federal income tax expense for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 because the estimated annual effective tax rate was zero. As of October
31, 2016, the Company continues to provide a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets since the Company believes
it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be fully realized. 

The provision for both Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 represents state
income taxes. 

Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests .
The change in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was due to Straight Path IP Group incurring losses in the Fiscal
2017 period compared to the loss in Fiscal 2016. 

Straight Path Spectrum Segment   

Revenues.   Revenues increased in Fiscal 2017 as the
result of the leasing of Spectrum to new customers (wireless network operators). 

Direct cost of revenues . Direct cost of revenues includes
governmental fees and connectivity costs. No such costs were incurred in Fiscal 2016. 

Selling, general and administrative . Selling, general
and administrative expense increased in Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the increase in the
number of employees and increases in salaries including the change in allocation of corporate level compensation costs
between entities, an increase of non-cash stock-based compensation charges related to the issuances of restricted common
stock to employees, marketing expenses related to the installation of radio links, and increased legal costs due to the
putative shareholder class action, derivative action, and regulatory enforcement activity. 

Straight Path IP Segment   

Revenues.  We have filed a series of lawsuits claiming infringement
of a number of our key patents seeking both damages and injunctive relief. Many of these actions were settled and we had entered
into licensing arrangements with the former defendants. In connection with the settlements and licenses, Straight Path IP Group recognized
revenue of approximately $1.6 million in Fiscal 2016. The gross payments under settlement and licensing agreements that had been
secured since the Company s Spin-Off (the beginning of Fiscal 2014) totaled $18.3 million as of October 31, 2015, all of
which has been collected. Most of these settlement agreements included license fees for the duration of the license term (which
was over the remaining life of the covered patents), and had been allocated across Fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016 in the amounts of
$4.2 million, $12.5 million and $1.6 million respectively, based on the settlement dates and if the settlement included a look
back period for damages. All of the revenue from these settlements has been recognized as of September 30, 2015. 

The PTAB s October 2014 decision on the  704 Patent
previously had a materially adverse impact on our ongoing enforcement efforts. During the pendency of the appeal from that decision
and related IPRs, a number of pending civil actions brought by Straight Path IP Group against various defendants were stayed or
dismissed without prejudice. In light of the favorable outcome on appeal and the favorable PTAB rulings in the related IPR proceedings,
Straight Path IP Group has re-commenced four civil actions (one of which has been stayed) and has requested to lift the stays in
two other actions (one request was denied). For further discussion of these actions, please see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item I of this Quarterly Report. 

Direct cost of revenues . Direct cost of revenues consisted
of legal expenses directly related to revenues from the litigation settlements described above. We incurred an aggregate of
$9.0 million in expenses directly related to these settlements, which was recognized ratably in proportion to the recognition
of the related revenue. We generally paid law firms that represented us in litigation against alleged infringers of our intellectual
property rights a percentage of the amounts recovered ranging from 0% to 40% depending on several factors. In addition, there
were other directly related legal expenses, such as expert testimony, travel, filing fees, and others. 

Selling, general and administrative . Selling, general and
administrative expenses decreased in Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the change in the allocation
of corporate level compensation costs between entities, including stock-based compensation for the issuances of restricted common
stock and stock options to officers and employees, and decreased legal costs due to Straight Path IP Group s appeal of the
PTAB s decision on the  704 Patent and related IPRs. 

Straight Path Ventures Segment   

Research and development . Research and development consists
of expenses related to development by our Gigabit Mobility Lab of next generation wireless technology for 39 GHz, and the filing
of two provisional patent applications. 

Selling, general and administrative . Selling, general and
administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related payroll taxes and benefits as well as stock-based compensation
expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

General  

Historically, we have primarily satisfied our cash requirements
through the initial funding provided in connection with the Spin-Off, proceeds from the sale or lease of rights in spectrum licenses,
and settlements or licensing fees received. In connection with the Spin-Off, IDT transferred cash to us such that we had approximately
$15 million in cash at the time of the Spin-Off. We currently expect that our cash and cash equivalents on-hand at October
31, 2016 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements during the twelve months ending October 31, 2017. 

We previously projected, filed on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ending January 31, 2016, an increase in spending of $2 $3 million from our initial expectations for a number of matters,
including procuring equipment, expenses for legal and other advisors, and related items. We have spent a significant portion of
this projected amount, including $1.4 million on currently available technology at 39 GHz and approximately $1.7 million on legal
and other advisors. We now anticipate that we will spend an additional $0.5-$1 million for legal and other advisors and approximately
$0.5 million on hardware and related costs, primarily for PMP applications at 39 GHz, while pursuing our long-term plans for enabling
fixed 5G services using our licensed spectrum. 

As of October 31, 2016, we had cash of $9.6 million and working
capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $9.3 million. In connection with the Spin-Off, we and IDT entered into
various agreements prior to the Spin-Off including a Separation and Distribution Agreement to effect the separation and provide
a framework for our relationship with IDT after the Spin-Off. The Separation and Distribution Agreement includes, among other
things, that IDT is obligated to reimburse us for the payment of liabilities arising or related to the period prior to the Spin-Off.
For Fiscal 2016 and through the date of the filing of this report, no payments were made by IDT pursuant to this obligation. 

The Former SPSI CEO is entitled to receive payments from future revenues generated from the leasing, licensing,
or sale of rights in certain a Straight Path Spectrum s wireless spectrum licenses. Those payments are to be made out of
50% of the covered revenue and are in a maximum aggregate amount of $3.25 million. The payments arise under the June 2013 settlement
of certain claims and disputes with the Former SPSI CEO and parties related to the Former SPSI CEO. Approximately $71,000 was
incurred to the Former SPSI CEO for this obligation for Fiscal 2017 and approximately $3,000 for Fiscal 2016. 

Operating Activities   

Cash flows used in operating activities in Fiscal 2017 totaled approximately
$1.8 million and was used to fund the loss for the quarter. 

We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock until
we achieve sustainable profitability after satisfying all of our operational needs, including payments to the Former SPSI CEO,
and retain certain minimum cash reserves. Following that time, we will retain sufficient cash to provide for investment in growth
opportunities and provide for the creation of long-term stockholder value, particularly through development of the spectrum business,
development of next generation wireless technology for 39 GHz, and possibly the acquisition of complementary businesses or assets.
However, we do not intend to retain earnings beyond those needs and beyond what we believe we can effectively deploy, and we expect
that such additional resources would be returned to stockholders via distributions or other means. The payment of dividends in
any specific period will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. 

Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments  

There are no material changes from the contractual obligations previously
disclosed in Item 7 to Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2016. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of October 31, 2016, we did not have any  off-balance sheet
arrangements,  as defined in relevant SEC regulations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, other than the following. 

In connection with the Spin-Off, we and IDT entered into various
agreements prior to the Spin-Off including a Separation and Distribution Agreement to effect the separation and provide a framework
for our relationship with IDT after the Spin-Off, and a Tax Separation Agreement, which sets forth the responsibilities of us and
IDT with respect to, among other things, liabilities for federal, state, local and foreign taxes for periods before and including
the Spin-Off, the preparation and filing of tax returns for such periods and disputes with taxing authorities regarding taxes for
such periods. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we indemnify IDT and IDT indemnifies us for losses related
to the failure of the other to pay, perform or otherwise discharge, any of the liabilities and obligations set forth in the agreement.
The Separation and Distribution Agreement includes, among other things, that IDT is obligated to reimburse us for the payment of
any liabilities arising or related to the period prior to the Spin-Off. 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risks  

The Company is not exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange
rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices or commodity prices for the following reasons: 

1.  All of the Company s transactions are in US dollars.   

2.  The Company has no outstanding debt payable.   

3.  The Company does not own any marketable securities.   

4.  The Company does not purchase any commodities.   

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of October 31, 2016. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

1.  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of our assets;   

2.  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of our management and directors; and   

3.  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detections of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2016 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission as adopted in 2013 (COSO). Our internal
control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP. Based
on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
of October 31, 2016. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
