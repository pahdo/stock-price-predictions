(1) Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (the  Financial Statements ) of The Wendy s Company ( The Wendy s Company  and, together with its subsidiaries, the  Company,   we,   us  or  our ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and, therefore, do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  In our opinion, the Financial Statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position as of   October 2, 2016   and the results of our operations for the   three and nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   and cash flows for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  .  The results of operations for the   three and nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full 2016 fiscal year.  These Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for The Wendy s Company and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016   (the  Form 10-K ). 
    
  The principal subsidiary of the Company is Wendy s International, LLC and its subsidiaries ( Wendy s ).  The Company manages and internally reports its business geographically.  The operation and franchising of Wendy s        restaurants in North America (defined as the United States of America ( U.S. ) and Canada) comprises virtually all of our current operations and represents a single reportable segment.  The revenues and operating results of Wendy s restaurants outside of North America are not material. 
    
  We report on a fiscal year consisting of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to or on December 31.  All three and   nine   month periods presented herein contain 13 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively.  All references to years and quarters relate to fiscal periods rather than calendar periods. 
    
  On May 31, 2015, Wendy s completed the sale of its company-owned bakery, The New Bakery Company, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Bakery ), a 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy s.  As a result of the sale of the Bakery, as further discussed in Note 2, the Bakery s results of operations for the period from December 29, 2014 through May 31, 2015 and the gain on disposal have been included in    Net (loss) income from discontinued operations    in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  The Company records rental income, including any related amortization of favorable and unfavorable lease balances, for properties leased or subleased to franchisees to  Franchise revenues.   Lease expense, including any related amortization, for leased properties that are subsequently subleased to franchisees is recorded to  Other operating expense, net.   We further describe our accounting for leases in our Form 10-K.   
    
  The following table presents the franchise rental income and lease expense included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations: 

In connection with the reimaging of restaurants as part of our Image Activation program, we have recorded accelerated depreciation of   $2,930   and   $6,578   during the nine months ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively, on certain long-lived assets to reflect their use over shortened estimated useful lives.  We describe the circumstances under which we record accelerated depreciation for properties in our Form 10-K.  
    
  Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year presentation to conform to the current year presentation.

  On May 31, 2015, Wendy s completed the sale of   100%   of its membership interest in the Bakery to East Balt US, LLC (the  Buyer ) for   $78,500   in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments).  The Company also assigned certain capital leases for transportation equipment to the Buyer but retained the related obligation, which was settled during 2015.  Pursuant to the sale agreement, the Company was obligated to continue to provide health insurance benefits to the Bakery s employees at the Company s expense through December 31, 2015.  The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the disposal of the Bakery of   $27,526   during the   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , which included transaction closing costs and a reduction of goodwill.

  In conjunction with the Bakery sale, Wendy s entered into a transition services agreement with the Buyer, pursuant to which Wendy s provided certain continuing corporate and shared services to the Buyer through March 31, 2016 for no additional consideration.  A purchasing cooperative, Quality Supply Chain Co-op, Inc. ( QSCC ), established by Wendy s and its franchisees, agreed to continue to source sandwich buns from the Bakery for a specified time period following the sale of the Bakery.  As a result, Wendy s paid the Buyer   $7,718   and   $4,699   for the purchase of sandwich buns during the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and for the period from June 1, 2015 through   September 27, 2015  , respectively, which has been recorded to  Cost of sales.   
    
  Information related to the Bakery has been reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as follows: 

Balance sheets - As a result of our sale of the Bakery on May 31, 2015, there are   no   remaining Bakery assets and liabilities.

(7) Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Valuation techniques under the accounting guidance related to fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs.  Observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions.  These inputs are classified into the following hierarchy: 

Level 1 Inputs - Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2 Inputs - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 

Level 3 Inputs - Pricing inputs are unobservable for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities.  The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. 
       
  Financial Instruments 
    
  The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments: 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The fair value of our indirect investment in Arby s Restaurant Group, Inc. ( Arby s ) is based on applying a multiple to Arby s adjusted earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization per its current unaudited financial information.  The carrying value of our indirect investment in Arby s was reduced to   zero   during 2013 in connection with the receipt of a dividend.  The fair values of our remaining investments are not significant and are based on our review of information provided by the investment managers or investees which was based on (1) valuations performed by the investment managers or investees, (2) quoted market or broker/dealer prices for similar investments and (3) quoted market or broker/dealer prices adjusted by the investment managers for legal or contractual restrictions, risk of nonperformance or lack of marketability, depending upon the underlying investments. 
       
           (b) 
    The fair values were based on quoted market prices in markets that are not considered active markets. 
       
           (c) 
    Wendy s has provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing.  In addition, during 2012, Wendy s provided a guarantee to a lender for a franchisee in connection with the refinancing of the franchisee s debt.  We have accrued a liability for the fair value of these guarantees, the calculation of which was based upon a weighted average risk percentage established at inception and adjusted for a history of defaults.

  (In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts) 

The carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated fair value due to the short-term nature of those items.  The carrying amounts of accounts and notes receivable (both current and non-current) approximated fair value due to the effect of the related allowance for doubtful accounts.  Our cash and cash equivalents and guarantees are the only financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 
    
  Derivative Instruments 
    
  The Company s primary objective for entering into interest rate swap agreements was to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. 
    
  Our derivative instruments for the   nine months ended     September 27, 2015   included   seven   forward-starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges to change the floating rate interest payments for   $350,000   and   $100,000   in borrowings associated with the Term A and Term B Loans, respectively, under the Company s prior credit agreement, to fixed rate interest payments beginning June 30, 2015 and maturing on December 31, 2017.  In May 2015, the Company terminated these interest rate swaps and paid   $7,275  , which was recorded against the derivative liability.  The unrealized loss on the cash flow hedges at termination of   $7,275   is being reclassified on a straight-line basis from  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  to  Interest expense  beginning June 30, 2015 (the original effective date of the interest rate swaps) through December 31, 2017 (the original maturity date of the interest rate swaps).  Reclassifications of unrealized losses on cash flow hedges from  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  to  Interest expense  were   $723   and   $2,170   for the three and   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , respectively, and   $708   for both the three and   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  . 
    
  There was   no   hedge ineffectiveness from these cash flows hedges through their termination in May 2015.  
    
  Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Assets and liabilities remeasured to fair value on a non-recurring basis during the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and the year ended   January 3, 2016   resulted in impairment that we have recorded to  Impairment of long-lived assets  in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Total losses for the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and the year ended   January 3, 2016   reflect the impact of remeasuring long-lived assets held and used (including land, buildings, leasehold improvements and favorable lease assets) to fair value as a result of (1) the Company s decision to lease and/or sublease the land and/or buildings to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of restaurants and (2) declines in operating performance at company-owned restaurants.  The fair value of long-lived assets held and used presented in the tables below represents the remaining carrying value and was estimated based on either discounted cash flows of future anticipated lease and sublease income or current market values.   
    
  Total losses for the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and the year ended   January 3, 2016   also include the impact of remeasuring long-lived assets held for sale, which primarily include surplus properties.  The fair values of long-lived assets held for sale presented in the tables below represent the remaining carrying value and were estimated based on current market values.  See   Note 8   for more information on impairment of our long-lived assets.

(8) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
    
  During the three and   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , the Company recorded impairment charges on long-lived assets as a result of (1) the Company s decision to lease and/or sublease properties to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of company-owned restaurants, (2) closing company-owned restaurants and classifying such properties as held for sale and (3) the deterioration in operating performance of certain company-owned restaurants and charges for capital improvements in restaurants impaired in prior years which did not subsequently recover.  The Company may recognize additional impairment charges resulting from leasing or subleasing additional properties to franchisees in connection with sales of company-owned restaurants to franchisees. 
    
  The following is a summary of impairment losses recorded, which represent the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the affected assets and are included in  Impairment of long-lived assets.  

(9) Income Taxes 
    
  The Company s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the three months ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   was   37.2%   and   70.5%  , respectively.  The Company s effective tax rate varies from the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   due to the effect of (1) non-deductible goodwill disposed of in connection with our system optimization initiative described in Note 3, (2) state income taxes net of federal benefits, including non-recurring changes to state deferred taxes, (3) changes to valuation allowances on state net operating loss carryforwards due to changes in expected future state taxable income available to utilize certain state net operating loss carryforwards and (4) employment credits.  
    
  The Company s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   was   33.3%   and   45.3%  , respectively.  The Company s effective tax rate varies from the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   due to the effect of (1) changes to valuation allowances on state net operating loss carryforwards due to the expected sale of restaurants under our system optimization initiative, including a correction to a prior year identified and recorded in the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in a benefit of   $2,878  , (2) state income taxes net of federal benefits, including non-recurring changes to state deferred taxes, (3) non-deductible goodwill disposed of in connection with our system optimization initiative, including a correction to a prior year identified and recorded in the second quarter of 2016, which resulted in a benefit of   $4,235   and (4) employment credits.  The Company evaluated the corrections of the prior year errors in relation to the estimated income for the full fiscal year and to the trend on earnings.  The Company concluded that correcting the errors did not materially affect the estimated 2016 full year income.   
    
  There were no significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits or related interest and penalties for the Company for the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  .  During the next twelve months, we believe that it is reasonably possible the Company will reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by up to   $393  ,   primarily due to expected settlements with taxing authorities. 
    
  The Company includes refundable income taxes in  Accounts and notes receivable  in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  Refundable income taxes were   $22,411   and   $23,508   as of   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  , respectively.

(10) Net Income Per Share 
    
  Basic net income per share was computed by dividing net income amounts by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. 
    
  The weighted average number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted net income per share were as follows: 

Diluted net income per share for the three and   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   was computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding plus the potential common share effect of dilutive stock options and restricted shares.  We excluded potential common shares of   2,233   and   2,072   for the three and   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , respectively, and   3,118   and   1,439   for the three and   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , respectively, from our diluted net income per share calculation as they would have had anti-dilutive effects.

Repurchases of Common Stock 
    
  On June 1, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to   $1,400,000   of our common stock through January 1, 2017, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible.  During the first nine months of 2016, the Company repurchased   16,034   shares with an aggregate purchase price of   $162,252  , of which   $2,998   was accrued at   October 2, 2016   and excluding commissions of   $240  .  As of   October 2, 2016  , the Company had   $215,904   of availability remaining under its June 2015 authorization.  Subsequent to   October 2, 2016   through   November 3, 2016  , the Company repurchased   2,108   shares with an aggregate purchase price of   $22,734  , excluding commissions of   $32  .  The Company announced its intention to complete substantially all of the   $1,400,000   share repurchase program by entering into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for   $150,000   during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  Also as part of the June 2015 authorization, the Company commenced an   $850,000   share repurchase program on June 3, 2015, which included (1) a modified Dutch auction tender offer to repurchase up to   $639,000   of our common stock and (2) a separate stock purchase agreement to repurchase up to   $211,000   of our common stock from Nelson Peltz, Peter W. May (Messrs. Peltz and May are members of the Company s Board of Directors) and Edward P. Garden (who served on the Company s Board of Directors until December 14, 2015) and certain of their family members and affiliates, investment funds managed by Trian Fund Management, L.P. (an investment management firm controlled by Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden,  TFM ) and the general partner of certain of those funds (together with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, certain of their family members and affiliates and TFM, the  Trian Group ).  On June 30, 2015, the tender offer expired and on July 8, 2015, the Company repurchased   55,808   shares at   $11.45   per share for an aggregate purchase price of   $639,000  .  On July 17, 2015, the Company repurchased   18,416   shares at   $11.45   per share, pursuant to the separate stock purchase agreement, for an aggregate purchase price of   $210,867  .  As a result, the   $850,000   share repurchase program that commenced on June 3, 2015 was completed during the third quarter of 2015.  During the   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , the Company incurred costs of   $2,288   in connection with the tender offer and Trian Group stock purchase agreement, which were recorded to treasury stock.  
    
  In August 2015, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the  ASR Agreement ) with a third-party financial institution to repurchase common stock as part of the Company s existing share repurchase programs.  Under the ASR Agreement, the Company paid the financial institution an initial purchase price of   $164,500   in cash and received an initial delivery of   14,385   shares of common stock, representing an estimate of   85%   of the total shares expected to be delivered under the ASR Agreement.  The total number of shares of common stock ultimately purchased by the Company under the ASR Agreement was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less an agreed discount.  On September 25, 2015, the Company completed the ASR Agreement and received an additional   3,551   shares of common stock.  During the three and nine months ended September 27, 2015, the Company incurred costs of   $32   in connection with the ASR Agreement, which were recorded to treasury stock. 
    
  In August 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to   $100,000   of our common stock through December 31, 2015, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible.  As part of the August 2014 authorization,   $76,111   remained available as of December 28, 2014.  During the first and second quarters of 2015, the Company repurchased   5,655   shares with an aggregate purchase price of   $61,631  , excluding commissions of   $86  .  During the third quarter of 2015, the Company repurchased   $14,480   through the accelerated share repurchase agreement described above.  As a result, the   $100,000   share repurchase program authorized in August 2014 was completed.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss  
    
  The following table provides a rollforward of the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax as applicable: 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    Current-period other comprehensive income (loss) includes the reclassification of unrealized losses on cash flow hedges from  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  to our condensed consolidated statements of operations of   $444   and   $1,332   for the three and   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , respectively, and   $435   for both the three and   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  .  The reclassification of unrealized losses on cash flow hedges consists of   $723   and   $2,170   for the three and   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , respectively, and   $708   for both the three and   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , recorded to  Interest expense,  net of the related income tax benefit of   $279   and   $838   for the three and   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , respectively, and   $273   for both the three and   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , recorded to  Provision for income taxes.   Current-period other comprehensive loss for the   nine months ended September 27, 2015   also includes the effect of changes in unrealized losses on cash flow hedges, net of tax.  See Note 7 for more information. 

(12) Transactions with Related Parties 
    
  Except as described below, the Company did not have any significant changes in or transactions with its related parties during the current fiscal period since those reported in the Form 10-K. 
    
  Transactions with QSCC 
    
  Wendy s received   $76   and   $138   of lease income from its purchasing cooperative, QSCC, during the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively, which has been recorded as a reduction to  General and administrative.  
    
  TimWen Lease and Management Fee Payments 
    
  A wholly-owned subsidiary of Wendy s leases restaurant facilities from TimWen for the operation of Wendy s/Tim Hortons combo units in Canada.  Prior to the second quarter of 2015, Wendy s operated certain of the Wendy s/Tim Hortons combo units in Canada and subleased some of the restaurant facilities to franchisees.  As a result of the Company completing its plan to sell all of its company-owned restaurants in Canada to franchisees during the second quarter of 2015, all of the restaurant facilities are subleased to franchisees.  During the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , Wendy s paid TimWen   $8,926   and   $9,066  , respectively, under these lease agreements.  In addition, TimWen paid Wendy s a management fee under the TimWen joint venture agreement of   $156   and   $164   during the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively, which has been included as a reduction to  General and administrative.

(13) Guarantees and Other Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Refer to the Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company s additional commitments and obligations. 
    
  Franchisee Image Activation Incentive Programs 
    
  In order to promote Image Activation new restaurant development, Wendy s has an incentive program for franchisees that provides for reductions in royalty payments for the first three years of operation for qualifying new restaurants opened by January 1, 2017.  
    
  Wendy s also has incentive programs for 2016 for franchisees that commence Image Activation restaurant remodels during the year.  The incentive programs provide for reductions in royalty payments for   one   year or   two   years after the completion of construction, depending on the type of remodel.  In 2015, Wendy s added an additional incentive to the 2016 program described above to include waiving the franchise agreement renewal fee for certain types of remodels. 
    
  In addition, Wendy s had incentive programs in 2015 that included reductions in royalty payments for franchisees  participation in the Image Activation program. 
    
  Franchisee Image Activation Financing Program 
    
  Wendy s executed an agreement in 2013 to partner with a third-party lender to establish a financing program for franchisees that participate in our Image Activation program.  Under the program, the lender agreed to provide loans to franchisees to be used for the reimaging of restaurants according to the guidelines and specifications under Wendy s Image Activation program.  To support the program, Wendy s provided to the lender a   $6,000   irrevocable stand-by letter of credit, which was issued on July 1, 2013 and was cash collateralized.  During the three months ended April 3, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to reduce the letter of credit from   $6,000   to   $1,000   due to franchisees successfully obtaining financing independently.  During the three months ended July 3, 2016, the new irrevocable letter of credit of   $1,000   was issued against the Company s   $2,275,000   securitized financing facility and the   $6,000   letter of credit was terminated.  During the three months ended   October 2, 2016  , the Company executed an agreement to terminate the letter of credit agreement that had been previously executed as part of the financing program and was fully released from the   $1,000   letter of credit against the securitized financing facility.  
    
  Lease Guarantees 
    
  Wendy s has guaranteed the performance of certain leases and other obligations, primarily from former company-owned restaurant locations now operated by franchisees, amounting to   $32,922   as of   October 2, 2016  .  These leases extend through 2050.  We have not received any notice of default related to these leases as of   October 2, 2016  .  In the event of default by a franchise owner, Wendy s generally retains the right to acquire possession of the related restaurant locations. 
    
  Wendy s is contingently liable for certain other leases which have been assigned to unrelated third parties who have indemnified Wendy s against future liabilities amounting to   $974   as of   October 2, 2016  .  These leases expire on various dates through 2021. 
    
  Letters of Credit 
    
  As of   October 2, 2016  , the Company had outstanding letters of credit with various parties totaling   $33,961  , of which   $6,165   were cash collateralized.  The outstanding letters of credit include amounts outstanding against the securitized financing facility.  The related cash collateral is classified as  Restricted cash  in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  We do not expect any material loss to result from these letters of credit. 

(14) Legal and Environmental Matters 
    
  We are involved in litigation and claims incidental to our current and prior businesses.  We provide accruals for such litigation and claims when payment is probable and reasonably estimable.  As of   October 2, 2016  , the Company had accruals for all of its legal and environmental matters aggregating   $1,508  .  We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions is thus inherently difficult.  Based on

     Table of Contents  
  THE WENDY S COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts) 

currently available information, including legal defenses available to us, and given the aforementioned accruals and our insurance coverage, we do not believe that the outcome of these legal and environmental matters will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

(15) New Accounting Standards 
    
  New Accounting Standards 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an amendment that provides guidance for proper classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows.  The amendment requires retrospective adoption for all periods presented in the statement of cash flows and is effective commencing with our 2018 fiscal year.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued an amendment that will require the Company to determine impairment of financial instruments based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.  The transition method varies with the type of instrument; however, most debt instruments will be transitioned using a modified retrospective approach.  The amendment is effective commencing with our 2020 fiscal year.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an amendment that modifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory withholding requirements, as well as statement of cash flows presentation.  The transition requirement is mostly modified retrospective, with the exception of recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies that requires prospective adoption.  The amendment is effective commencing with our 2017 fiscal year.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an amendment that clarifies the steps for assessing triggering events of embedded contingent put and call options within debt instruments.  The amendment requires modified retrospective adoption and is effective commencing with our 2017 fiscal year.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an amendment related to equity method accounting, which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting as a result of an increase in level of ownership interest or degree of influence.  The amendment requires prospective adoption and is effective commencing with our 2017 fiscal year.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on leases, which outlines principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases applicable to both lessors and lessees.  The new guidance requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by finance and operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.  The amendment requires the recognition and measurement of leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach and is effective commencing with our 2019 fiscal year.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements, but we expect this will have a material effect on our balance sheet since the Company has a significant amount of operating and capital lease arrangements.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance for revenue recognition.  Subsequently, the FASB issued an amendment to defer for   one   year the effective date of the new guidance on revenue recognition, as well as issued additional clarifying amendments.  The new guidance outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.  The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosure to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized.  The new guidance supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, and is now effective commencing with our 2018 fiscal year.  The guidance allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method.  We are continuing to evaluate which transition method to use.  We do not believe this guidance will impact our recognition of revenue from company-owned restaurant sales or our recognition of continuing royalty revenues from franchisees, which are based on a percentage of franchise sales.  We are continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our business, including the recognition of transactions

such as franchise development fees, initial fees from franchisees and sales of company-owned restaurants to franchisees, as well as the accounting for our national advertising funds. 
    
  New Accounting Standards Adopted 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued an amendment that requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts during the measurement period, in the period such adjustments are identified, rather than retrospectively adjusting previously reported amounts.  The Company adopted this amendment, prospectively, during the first quarter of 2016.  The adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued an amendment that clarifies the accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement.  The amendment provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  The Company adopted this amendment, prospectively, during the first quarter of 2016.  The adoption of this guidance did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued an amendment that revises the consolidation requirements and significantly changes the consolidation analysis required under current guidance.  The Company adopted this amendment, prospectively, during the first quarter of 2016.  The adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2014, the FASB issued an amendment to clarify that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period should be treated as a performance condition and therefore should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.  The Company adopted this amendment during the first quarter of 2016.  The adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements.

Item 2.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Introduction 
    
  This  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of The Wendy s Company ( The Wendy s Company  and, together with its subsidiaries, the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere within this report and  Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 (the  Form 10-K ).  There have been no material changes as of   October 2, 2016   to the application of our critical accounting policies as described in Item 7 of the Form 10-K.  Certain statements we make under this Item 2 constitute  forward-looking statements  under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  See  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections  in  Part II - Other Information  preceding Item 1 of Part II of this report.  You should consider our forward-looking statements in light of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report, the Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    
  The Wendy s Company is the parent company of its 100% owned subsidiary holding company, Wendy s Restaurants, LLC ( Wendy s Restaurants ).  The principal 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy s Restaurants is Wendy s International, LLC and its subsidiaries ( Wendy s ).  Wendy s franchises and operates company-owned Wendy s        quick-service restaurants throughout North America (defined as the United States of America ( U.S. ) and Canada).  Wendy s also has franchised restaurants in 28 foreign countries and U.S. territories. 
    
  Wendy s restaurants offer an extensive menu specializing in hamburger sandwiches and featuring fillet of chicken breast sandwiches, chicken nuggets, chili, french fries, baked potatoes, freshly prepared salads, soft drinks, Frosty        desserts and kids  meals.  In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of promotional products on a limited basis. 
    
  The Company manages and internally reports its business geographically.  The operation and franchising of Wendy s restaurants in North America comprises virtually all of our current operations and represents a single reportable segment.  The revenues and operating results of Wendy s restaurants outside of North America are not material.  The results of operations discussed below may not necessarily be indicative of future results. 
    
  The Company reports on a fiscal year consisting of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to or on December 31.  All three and nine month periods presented herein contain 13 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively.  All references to years and quarters relate to fiscal periods rather than calendar periods. 
    
  Executive Overview 
    
  Sale of the Bakery 
    
  On May 31, 2015, Wendy s completed the sale of 100% of its membership interest in The New Bakery Company, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Bakery ) to East Balt US, LLC (the  Buyer ) for   $78.5 million   in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments).  The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the disposal of the Bakery of   $27.5 million   during the first nine months of 2015, which included transaction closing costs and a reduction of goodwill.  The Company recognized income tax expense associated with the gain on disposal of   $12.7 million   during the first nine months of 2015, which included the impact of the disposal of non-deductible goodwill.  In conjunction with the Bakery sale, Wendy s entered into a transition services agreement with the Buyer, pursuant to which Wendy s provided certain continuing corporate and shared services to the Buyer through March 31, 2016 for no additional consideration.  As a result of the sale of the Bakery, the Bakery s results of operations for the period from December 29, 2014 through May 31, 2015 and the gain on disposal have been included in  Net income from discontinued operations  in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
    
  Our Continuing Business 
    
  As of   October 2, 2016  , the Wendy s restaurant system was comprised of   6,503   restaurants, of which   427   were owned and operated by the Company.  All of our company-owned restaurants are located in the U.S. as a result of the Company completing its initiative during the second quarter of 2015 to sell all company-owned restaurants in Canada to franchisees.  
    
  Wendy s operating results are impacted by a number of external factors, including unemployment, general economic trends, intense price competition, commodity costs, labor costs and weather. 
  
    26 

Wendy s long-term growth opportunities will be driven by a combination of brand relevance and economic relevance.  Key components of growth include (1) North America systemwide same-restaurant sales growth through continuing core menu improvement, product innovation and customer count growth, (2) investing in our Image Activation program, which includes innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs for our new and reimaged restaurants and focused execution of operational excellence, (3) growth in new restaurants, including global growth, (4) increased restaurant utilization in various dayparts and brand access utilizing mobile technology, (5) building shareholder value through financial management strategies and (6) our system optimization initiative. 
    
  Wendy s revenues for the   first nine months of 2016   include (1)   $747.2 million   of sales at company-owned restaurants and (2)   $255.0 million   of royalty revenue,   $102.4 million   of rental income and   $20.9 million   of franchise fees from franchisees.  Substantially all of our Wendy s royalty agreements provide for royalties of 4.0% of franchisees  revenues. 
    
  Key Business Measures 
    
  We track our results of operations and manage our business using the following key business measures: 

Same-Restaurant Sales - Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, the Company revised its reporting methodology for same-restaurant sales to simplify the reporting of its same-restaurant sales performance for reimaged restaurants and to better align with restaurant-industry practice.  Under the new methodology, the Company includes restaurants in its comparable sales base as soon as reimaged restaurants reopen (the  New Method ).  Reimaged restaurants previously entered the comparable sales base after they had been open for three continuous months (the  Old Method ).  There was no change in the reporting methodology for new restaurants, which will continue to be excluded from same-restaurant sales until they have been open for 15 continuous months.  The tables summarizing the results of operations below provide the same-restaurant sales percent change using the New Method, as well as the Old Method.  The New Method is consistent with the metric used by our management for internal reporting and analysis.  Same-restaurant sales exclude the impact of currency translation. 

Restaurant Margin - We define restaurant margin as sales from company-owned restaurants less cost of sales divided by sales from company-owned restaurants.  Cost of sales includes food and paper, restaurant labor and occupancy, advertising and other operating costs.  Restaurant margin is influenced by factors such as restaurant openings, remodels and closures, price increases, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing initiatives, featured products, product mix, the level of our fixed and semi-variable costs and fluctuations in food and labor costs. 
       
  System Optimization Initiative 
    
  In July 2013, the Company announced a system optimization initiative, as part of its brand transformation, which includes a shift from company-owned restaurants to franchised restaurants over time, through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers.  In February 2015, the Company announced plans to sell approximately 540 additional restaurants to franchisees and reduce its ongoing company-owned restaurant ownership to approximately 5% of the total system by the end of 2016.  During   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the Company completed the sale of   327  ,   255   and   244   company-owned restaurants to franchisees, respectively, which included the sale of all its company-owned restaurants in Canada.   
    
  During the   first nine months of 2016   and 2015, the Company completed the sale of   211   and   109   company-owned restaurants to franchisees, respectively.  The Company recognized net gains totaling   $48.1 million   and   $14.8 million   on the sale of company-owned restaurants and other assets during the   first nine months of 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which were recorded to    System optimization (gains) losses, net    in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.  In addition, the Company facilitated the transfer of   144   restaurants between franchisees during the   first nine months of 2016  .  The Company expects to complete its plan to reduce company-owned restaurant ownership to approximately   5%   of the total system with the sale of   98   restaurants during the remainder of   2016  , all of which were classified as held for sale as of   October 2, 2016  .  
    
  Costs related to our system optimization initiative are recorded to  Reorganization and realignment costs.   During the   first nine months of 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized costs totaling   $6.9 million   and   $6.6 million  , respectively, which primarily included professional fees in 2016 and accelerated amortization of previously acquired franchise rights in both 2016 and 2015.  The Company expects to incur additional costs of approximately   $3.7 million   during the remainder of   2016   in connection with its system optimization initiative, which are primarily comprised of professional fees. 

27 

General and Administrative (     G A   )   Realignment 
    
  In November 2014, the Company initiated a plan to reduce its general and administrative expenses.  The plan included a realignment and reinvestment of resources to focus primarily on accelerated restaurant development and consumer-facing restaurant technology to drive long-term growth.  The Company achieved the majority of the expense reductions through the realignment of its U.S. field operations and savings at its Restaurant Support Center in Dublin, Ohio, which was substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2015.  Costs related to G A realignment are recorded to  Reorganization and realignment costs.   The Company recognized costs totaling   $1.0 million   and   $10.0 million   during the   first nine months of 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which primarily included recruitment and relocation costs in 2016 and share-based compensation and severance and related employee costs in   2015  .  The Company expects to incur additional costs aggregating approximately   $0.4 million   during the remainder of 2016, comprised primarily of recruitment and relocation costs for the reinvestment in resources to drive long-term growth.  
    
  Related Party Transactions 
    
  TimWen Lease and Management Fees 
    
  A wholly-owned subsidiary of Wendy s leases restaurant facilities from TimWen for the operation of Wendy s/Tim Hortons combo units in Canada.  Prior to the second quarter of 2015, Wendy s operated certain of the Wendy s/Tim Hortons combo units in Canada and subleased some of the restaurant facilities to franchisees.  As a result of the Company completing its plan to sell all of its company-owned restaurants in Canada to franchisees during the second quarter of 2015, all of the restaurant facilities are subleased to franchisees.  During the   first nine months of 2016   and   2015  , Wendy s paid TimWen   $8.9 million   and   $9.1 million  , respectively, under these lease agreements.  In addition, TimWen paid Wendy s a management fee under the TimWen joint venture agreement of   $0.2 million   during both the   first nine months of 2016   and   2015  , which has been included as a reduction to  General and administrative.  
    
  Franchisee Incentive Programs 
    
  Franchisee Image Activation Financing Program 
    
  Wendy s executed an agreement in 2013 to partner with a third-party lender to establish a financing program for franchisees that participate in our Image Activation program.  Under the program, the lender agreed to provide loans to franchisees to be used for the reimaging of restaurants according to the guidelines and specifications under Wendy s Image Activation program.  To support the program, Wendy s provided to the lender a   $6.0 million   irrevocable stand-by letter of credit, which was issued on July 1, 2013 and was cash collateralized.  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to reduce the letter of credit from   $6.0 million   to   $1.0 million   due to franchisees successfully obtaining financing independently.  During the second quarter of 2016, the new irrevocable letter of credit of   $1.0 million   was issued against the Company s $2,275.0 million securitized financing facility and the   $6.0 million   letter of credit was terminated.  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company executed an agreement to terminate the letter of credit agreement that had been previously executed as part of the financing program and was fully released from the   $1.0 million   letter of credit against the securitized financing facility.  
    
  Cybersecurity Incident 
    
  The Company first reported unusual payment card activity affecting some franchise-owned restaurants in February 2016 and that malware had been discovered on certain systems.  Subsequently, on June 9, 2016, the Company reported that an additional malware variant had been identified and disabled.  On July 7, 2016, the Company, on behalf of affected franchise locations, provided information about specific restaurant locations that may have been impacted by these attacks, all of which are located in the United States, along with support for customers who may have been affected by the malware variants.  See  Item 1 - Legal Proceedings  and  Item 1A - Risk Factors  in  Part II - Other Information  for further information.

The   decrease   in sales during the   third   quarter of   2016   was primarily due to the impact of Wendy s company-owned restaurants sold under our system optimization initiative, which resulted in a reduction in sales of $139.5 million.  Company-owned same-restaurant sales during the   third   quarter of 2016 increased primarily due to an increase in customer count, partially offset by a slight decrease in our average per customer check amount, primarily resulting from changes in product mix.  Sales also benefited from higher sales growth at our new and remodeled Image Activation restaurants.  

The increase in franchise revenues during the   third   quarter of   2016   was primarily due to increases in rental income, royalty revenue and initial franchise fees resulting from sales of company-owned restaurants to franchisees and facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers under our system optimization initiative.  Royalty revenue also benefited from a 1.3% increase in franchise same-restaurant sales.

The increase in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, during the   third   quarter of   2016   was primarily due to (1) the negative impact of changes in product mix, (2) higher medical insurance costs and (3) increased labor rates at company-owned restaurants.  These increases in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, were partially offset by a decrease in commodity costs, reflecting lower beef prices.  Cost of sales, as a percent of sales, also benefited from the increase in same-restaurant sales and higher sales at our new and remodeled Image Activation restaurants.

The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the   third   quarter of   2016   was primarily due to decreases in (1) employee compensation and related expenses primarily as a result of changes in staffing driven by our ongoing system optimization initiative, (2) share-based compensation primarily as a result of awards granted and timing of expense recognition and (3) incentive compensation accruals due to a decrease in operating performance as compared to plan in 2016 versus 2015.  These decreases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by an increase in professional services due to legal and other costs associated with the cybersecurity incident (see  Item 1 - Legal Proceedings  and  Item 1A - Risk Factors  in  Part II - Other Information  for further information).

The decrease in restaurant depreciation and amortization during the   third   quarter of 2016 was primarily due to decreases in depreciation on assets sold or classified as held for sale under our system optimization initiative of $6.5 million. 

The increase in system optimization (gains) losses, net during the   third   quarter of   2016   was primarily due to increased sales of company-owned restaurants to franchisees.  The Company sold   156   restaurants during the third quarter of   2016   compared to nine restaurants in   2015  .  

During the   third   quarter of   2015  , the Company recognized costs associated with its G A realignment plan totaling   $1.5 million  , which primarily included share-based compensation expense of   $0.7 million   and severance and related employee costs of   $0.5 million  .

The increase in other operating expense, net during the   third   quarter of 2016 was primarily due to an increase in lease expense resulting from (1) subleasing properties to franchisees that were previously operated as company-owned restaurants and as such, had been previously recorded in cost of sales and (2) entering into new leases in connection with facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers for purposes of subleasing such properties to the franchisee.

The   decrease   in sales during the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily due to the impact of Wendy s company-owned restaurants sold under our system optimization initiative, which resulted in a reduction in sales of $397.5 million.  Company-owned same-restaurant sales during the first   nine   months of   2016   increased primarily due to an increase in customer count, partially offset by a slight decrease in our average per customer check amount, primarily resulting from changes in product mix.

The increase in general and administrative expenses during the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily due to increases in (1) legal reserves, (2) professional services due to legal and other costs associated with the cybersecurity incident (see  Item 1 - Legal Proceedings  and  Item 1A - Risk Factors  in  Part II - Other Information  for further information) and (3) severance expense.  These increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation and related expenses primarily as a result of changes in staffing driven by our ongoing system optimization initiative. 

36 

The decrease in restaurant depreciation and amortization during the   nine   months of 2016 was primarily due to decreases in (1) depreciation on assets sold or classified as held for sale under our system optimization initiative of $16.6 million and (2) accelerated depreciation on existing assets that are being replaced as part of our Image Activation program of $3.6 million. 

The increase in system optimization gains, net during the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily due to increased sales of company-owned restaurants to franchisees.  The Company sold   211   restaurants during the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   109   restaurants in   2015  .  

During the first   nine   months of 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized costs associated with its G A realignment plan totaling   $1.0 million   and   $10.0 million  , respectively.  During the first   nine   months of 2016, costs primarily included recruitment and relocation costs.  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , costs primarily included (1) share-based compensation expense of   $5.6 million  , (2) severance and related employee costs of   $3.1 million   and (3) recruitment and relocation costs of   $1.3 million  . 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized costs associated with its system optimization initiative totaling   $6.9 million   and   $6.6 million  , respectively.  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , costs primarily included (1) professional fees of   $5.1 million   and (2) accelerated amortization of previously acquired franchise rights of   $1.6 million  .  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , costs primarily included accelerated amortization of previously acquired franchise rights.

    $ 
    (0.5 
    ) 

Impairment of long-lived assets decreased during the first   nine   months of   2016   due to lower impairment charges resulting from (1) the deterioration in operating performance of certain company-owned restaurants and charges for capital improvements in restaurants impaired in prior years which did not subsequently recover and (2) closing company-owned restaurants and classifying such properties as held for sale.  These decreases were partially offset by higher impairment charges resulting from the remeasurement of properties to fair value upon determination that the assets will be leased and/or subleased to franchisees in connection with the sale of company-owned restaurants.  

37 

The increase in other operating expense, net during the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily due to an increase in lease expense resulting from (1) subleasing properties to franchisees that were previously operated as company-owned restaurants and as such, had been recorded to cost of sales and (2) entering into new leases in connection with facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers for purposes of subleasing such properties to the franchisee.  The increase in expense was partially offset by a gain recognized on a lease buyout during the first quarter of 2016.

The increase in interest expense during the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily a result of the Company completing a $2,275.0 million securitized financing facility on June 1, 2015.  The principal amounts outstanding under the securitized financing facility significantly exceed the amounts that were outstanding under the Company s prior credit agreement.  In addition, the notes under the securitized financing facility bear fixed-rate interest at rates higher than our historical effective interest rates on our variable interest rate loans under the prior credit agreement.  
    
  Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt 
    
  During the second quarter of 2015, the Company incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt as a result of repaying all amounts outstanding under the Company s prior credit agreement with the proceeds from its securitized financing facility.  The loss on the early extinguishment of debt was primarily comprised of the write-off of deferred costs associated with the prior credit agreement of   $7.2 million   and fees paid to terminate the related interest rate swaps of   $0.1 million  .

During the first   nine   months of 2015, the Company recognized a gain on the disposal of the Bakery of   $14.8 million  , net of income tax expense of   $12.7 million  , which has been included in net income from discontinued operations.  The provision for income taxes on the gain on disposal includes the impact of non-deductible goodwill disposed of as a result of the sale.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities   increased     $12.2 million   in the   first nine months of 2016   as compared to the   first nine months of 2015  , primarily due to changes in our net income and non-cash items as well as the following: 

an increase of   $23.9 million   as a result of cash restricted for the payment of interest under our securitized financing facility during the second quarter of 2015; and 

an increase of   $7.3 million   as a result of payments to terminate our cash flow hedges during the second quarter of 2015; partially offset by 

an increase of $30.0 million in interest payments primarily resulting from the securitized financing facility;  

a   $47.4 million   increase in income tax payments, net of refunds; and 

an increase in payments for incentive compensation for the 2015 fiscal year. 
       
  Cash provided by investing activities   increased     $126.0 million   in the   first nine months of 2016   as compared to the   first nine months of 2015  , primarily due to the following: 

an increase of   $127.5 million   in proceeds from dispositions related to our system optimization initiative; and 

a decrease   of   $79.5 million   in capital expenditures; partially offset by 

a decrease   of   $78.4 million   in proceeds from the sale of the Bakery during the second quarter of 2015. 
       
  Cash used in financing activities   increased     $79.2 million   in the   first nine months of 2016   as compared to the   first nine months of 2015  , primarily due to non-cash items as well as the following: 

a net decrease in cash provided by long-term debt activities of $950.4 million primarily from the Company s $2,275.0 million securitized financing facility and the related repayment of debt under the Company s prior credit agreement during the second quarter of   2015  ; partially offset by 

a decrease in repurchases of common stock of $917.2 million. 
       
  The net cash used in our business before the effect of exchange rate changes on cash was approximately   $22.4 million  . 
    
  Sources and Uses of Cash for the Remainder of   2016 
    
  Our anticipated sources of cash and cash requirements for the remainder of   2016  , exclusive of operating cash flow requirements, consist principally of: 

capital expenditures of approximately   $36.3 million  , resulting in total anticipated cash capital expenditures for the year of approximately   $145.0 million  . 

quarterly cash dividends aggregating up to approximately   $15.9 million   as discussed below in  Dividends;  

consideration paid for restaurant acquisitions and proceeds from restaurant dispositions under our system optimization initiative. 
       
  Based on current levels of operations, the Company expects that cash flows from operations and available cash will provide sufficient liquidity to meet operating cash requirements for the next 12 months.

Dividends 
    
  On March 15, 2016, June 15, 2016 and September 15, 2016, The Wendy s Company paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per share on its common stock, aggregating   $47.8 million  .  On November 9, 2016, The Wendy s Company declared a dividend of $0.065 per share to be paid on December 15, 2016 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2016.  As a result of the declaration, The Wendy s Company s total cash requirements for the fourth quarter of   2016   will be approximately   $15.9 million   based on the estimated number of shares of common stock outstanding at December 1, 2016.  The Wendy s Company currently intends to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends; however, there can be no assurance that any quarterly dividends will be declared or paid in the future or of the amount or timing of such dividends, if any. 
    
  Stock Repurchases 
    
  On June 1, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to $1.4 billion of our common stock through January 1, 2017, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible.  During the first nine months of 2016, the Company repurchased   16.0 million   shares with an aggregate purchase price of   $162.3 million  , of which   $3.0 million   was accrued at   October 2, 2016   and excluding commissions of   $0.2 million  .  As of   October 2, 2016  , the Company had   $215.9 million   of availability remaining under its June 2015 authorization.  Subsequent to   October 2, 2016   through   November 3, 2016  , the Company repurchased   2.1 million   shares with an aggregate purchase price of   $22.7 million  , excluding commissions.  The Company announced its intention to complete substantially all of the $1.4 billion share repurchase program by entering into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for   $150.0 million   during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  Also as part of the June 2015 authorization, the Company commenced an   $850.0 million   share repurchase program on June 3, 2015, which included (1) a modified Dutch auction tender offer to repurchase up to   $639.0 million   of our common stock and (2) a separate stock purchase agreement to repurchase up to   $211.0 million   of our common stock from Nelson Peltz, Peter W. May (Messrs. Peltz and May are members of the Company s Board of Directors) and Edward P. Garden (who served on the Company s Board of Directors until December 14, 2015) and certain of their family members and affiliates, investment funds managed by Trian Fund Management, L.P. (an investment management firm controlled by Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden,  TFM ) and the general partner of certain of those funds (together with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, certain of their family members and affiliates and TFM, the  Trian Group ).  On June 30, 2015, the tender offer expired and on July 8, 2015, the Company repurchased 55.8 million shares at $11.45 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $639.0 million.  On July 17, 2015, the Company repurchased 18.4 million shares at $11.45 per share, pursuant to the separate stock purchase agreement, for an aggregate purchase price of $210.9 million.  As a result, the   $850.0 million   share repurchase program that commenced on June 3, 2015 was completed during the third quarter of 2015.  During the   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , the Company incurred costs of   $2.3 million   in connection with the tender offer and Trian Group stock purchase agreement, which were recorded to treasury stock.    
    
  In August 2015, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the  ASR Agreement ) with a third-party financial institution to repurchase common stock as part of the Company s existing share repurchase programs.  Under the ASR Agreement, the Company paid the financial institution an initial purchase price of   $164.5 million   in cash and received an initial delivery of   14.4 million   shares of common stock, representing an estimate of   85%   of the total shares expected to be delivered under the ASR Agreement.  The total number of shares of common stock ultimately purchased by the Company under the ASR Agreement was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less an agreed discount.  On September 25, 2015, the Company completed the ASR Agreement and received an additional   3.6 million   shares of common stock.  
    
  In August 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of our common stock through December 31, 2015, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible.  As part of the August 2014 authorization, $76.1 million remained available as of December 28, 2014.  During the first and second quarters of 2015, the Company repurchased   5.7 million   shares with an aggregate purchase price of   $61.6 million  , excluding commissions of   $0.1 million  .  During the third quarter of 2015, the Company repurchased $14.5 million through the accelerated share repurchase agreement described above.  As a result, the $100.0 million share repurchase program authorized in August 2014 was completed.

General Inflation, Commodities and Changing Prices 
    
  We believe that general inflation did not have a significant effect on our condensed consolidated results of operations during the reporting periods.  We manage any inflationary costs and commodity price increases primarily through selective menu price increases.  Delays in implementing such menu price increases and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in the future.  Inherent volatility experienced in certain commodity markets, such as those for beef, chicken, corn, pork and cheese could have an unfavorable effect on our results of operations in the future.  The extent of any impact will depend on our ability and timing to increase food prices. 
    
  Seasonality 
    
  Our restaurant operations are moderately impacted by seasonality; Wendy s restaurant revenues are normally higher during the summer months than during the winter months.  Because our business is moderately seasonal, results for any future quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year. 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
    
  As of   October 2, 2016   there were no material changes from the information contained in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016  . 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures. 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )), as of   October 2, 2016  .  Based on such evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of   October 2, 2016  , the  disclosure controls and procedures of the Company were effective at a reasonable assurance level in (1) recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act and (2) ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting of the Company during the   third   quarter of   2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
    
  There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any control system, including the potential for human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures.  Additionally, judgments in decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake.  An effective control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control objectives of the system are adequately met.  Accordingly, the management of the Company, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the control system can prevent or detect all errors or fraud.  Finally, projections of any evaluation or assessment of effectiveness of a control system to future periods are subject to the risks that, over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in an entity s operating environment or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

  All future written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

    44 

or developments, except as required by federal securities laws.  In addition, it is our policy generally not to endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties. 

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings. 
    
  We are involved in litigation and claims incidental to our current and prior businesses.  We provide accruals for such litigation and claims when payment is probable and reasonably estimable.  The Company believes it has adequate accruals for continuing operations for all of its legal and environmental matters.  We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions is thus inherently difficult.  Based on our currently available information, including legal defenses available to us, and given the aforementioned accruals and our insurance coverage, we do not believe that the outcome of these legal and environmental matters will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  The Company was named as a defendant in a civil complaint that was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida on February 8, 2016 by plaintiff Jonathan Torres.  The complaint asserted claims of breach of implied contract, negligence and violations of the Florida Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act arising from the Company s alleged failure to safeguard customer credit card information and the alleged failure to provide notice that credit card information had been compromised.  The complaint sought certification of a putative nationwide class of consumers impacted by the alleged failures.  The plaintiff sought monetary damages, injunctive and equitable relief, attorneys  fees and other costs.  The Company s motion to dismiss the complaint was granted, without prejudice, on July 15, 2016.   
    
  An amended complaint was filed in the same court by plaintiff Jonathan Torres and six additional named plaintiffs on July 29, 2016.  The amended complaint names the Company s subsidiary, Wendy s International, LLC ( Wendy s International ), as the defendant and asserts claims of breach of implied contract, negligence and violations of state consumer protection or deceptive trade practices statutes in the states of Florida, New York, New Jersey, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas arising from Wendy s International s alleged failure to safeguard customer credit card information and the alleged failure to provide notice that credit card information had been compromised.  The amended complaint also asserts violations of state data breach statutes in Florida, New York, New Jersey, Tennessee and Texas based on Wendy s International s alleged failure to timely and fully disclose the alleged data breach.  The amended complaint seeks certification of a putative nationwide class of consumers impacted by the alleged failures, or in the alternative, statewide classes for Florida, New York, New Jersey, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas.  The plaintiffs seek monetary damages, injunctive and equitable relief, attorneys  fees and other costs.  The Company s motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending before the court.  
    
  This case was previously described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 3, 2016 and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed on May 11, 2016 and August 10, 2016.  
    
  The Company was named as a defendant in a civil complaint that was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on April 25, 2016 by plaintiff First Choice Federal Credit Union.  The complaint asserts claims of common law negligence, negligence per se due to the alleged violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and declaratory and injunctive relief.  All of these claims are based on the allegations arising from the Company s alleged failure to safeguard customer credit card information and the alleged failure to provide notice that credit card information had been compromised.  The complaint sought certification of a putative nationwide class of banks, credit unions, financial institutions and other entities in the United States impacted by the alleged failures.  The plaintiff sought monetary damages, a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, attorneys  fees and other costs.  
    
  The Company was named as a defendant in four other civil complaints filed by financial institutions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania based on the allegations arising from the Company s alleged failure to safeguard customer credit card information and the alleged failure to provide notice that credit card information had been compromised.  These cases were consolidated into the First Choice Federal Credit Union case. 
    
  An amended civil complaint was filed in the consolidated proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on July 22, 2016 naming the Company and two of its subsidiaries as defendants.  The amended complaint was brought by 22 financial institutions and five association plaintiffs (representing members who are credit unions and other similar financial institutions).  The amended complaint asserts claims of common law negligence, negligence per se due to the alleged violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, violation of the Ohio Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and declaratory and injunctive relief.  The amended complaint also seeks certification of a putative nationwide class of banks, credit unions,  
  
    45 

financial institutions and other entities in the United States impacted by the alleged failures.  The plaintiffs seek monetary damages, a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, attorneys  fees and other costs.  The Company s motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending before the court.  
    
  This case was previously described in the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 11, 2016 and August 10, 2016.  
    
  The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to each of the actions described above and intends to vigorously oppose the claims asserted in each of the complaints.

  In addition to the information contained in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in our Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.  Except as set forth below or as may otherwise be described elsewhere in this report, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Form 10-K. 
    
  Certain of Our Franchisees have Experienced a Cybersecurity Incident 
    
  The Company first reported unusual payment card activity affecting some franchise-owned restaurants in February 2016 and that malware had been discovered on certain systems.  Subsequently, on June 9, 2016, the Company reported that an additional malware variant had been identified and disabled.  On July 7, 2016, the Company, on behalf of affected franchise locations, provided information about specific restaurant locations that may have been impacted by these attacks, all of which are located in the United States, along with support for customers who may have been affected by the malware variants. 
    
  Working closely with third-party forensic experts, federal law enforcement and payment card industry contacts as part of its ongoing investigation, the Company determined that specific payment card information was targeted by the additional malware variant.  This information included cardholder name, credit or debit card number, expiration date, cardholder verification value and service code. 
    
  The Company believes the criminal cyberattacks resulted from service providers  remote access credentials being compromised, allowing access, and the ability to deploy malware, to some franchisees  point-of-sale systems.  There has been no indication in the ongoing investigation that any company-owned restaurants were impacted by this activity. 
    
  The Company worked with investigators to disable the malware involved in the first attack earlier this year.  Soon after detecting the malware variant involved in the latest attack, the Company identified a method of disabling it and thereafter disabled it in all franchisee restaurants where it was discovered.  The investigation has confirmed that criminals used malware believed to have been effectively deployed on some Wendy s franchisee systems starting in late fall 2015. 
    
  The Company has been named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the United States on behalf of customers, as well as five class actions brought by financial institutions in the United States that have been consolidated into a single proceeding.  These class actions seek damages and other relief allegedly arising from the cybersecurity incident.  In addition, claims may also be made by payment card networks against the affected franchisees.  These claims and investigations may adversely affect how we or our franchisees operate the business, divert the attention of management from the operation of the business, have an adverse effect on our reputation, result in additional costs and adversely affect our results of operations.

  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  .  You agree that you will not at any time during your employment and anytime thereafter, divulge, furnish, or make known or accessible to, or use for the benefit of anyone other than Wendy s, its subsidiaries affiliates and their respective officers, directors and employee, any information of a confidential nature relating in any way to the business of Wendy s or its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any of their respective franchisees, suppliers or distributors. You further agree that you are not subject to any agreement that would restrict you from performing services to Wendy s and that you will not disclose to Wendy s or use on its behalf, any confidential information or material that is the property of a former employer or third party.   
    
  NONCOMPETE/NONSOLICITATION/EMPLOYEE NO-HIRE  .  You acknowledge that you will be involved, at the highest level, in the development, implementation, and management of Wendy s business strategies and plans, including those which involve Wendy s finances, marketing and other operations, and acquisitions and, as a result, you will have access to Wendy s most valuable trade secrets and proprietary information. By virtue of your unique and sensitive position, your employment by a competitor of Wendy s represents a material unfair competitive danger to Wendy s and the use of your knowledge and information about Wendy s business, strategies and plans can and would constitute a competitive advantage over Wendy s.  You further acknowledge that the provisions of this section are reasonable and necessary to protect Wendy s legitimate business interests. 
    
  You agree that during your employment with Wendy s and either (x) in the event your employment with Wendy s is terminated  without cause , for a period of eighteen (18) months following such termination, or (y) in the event your employment with Wendy s is terminated for cause, for a period of twelve (12) months following such termination: 
    
  (i) in any state or territory of the United States (and the District of Columbia) or any country where Wendy s maintains restaurants, you will not engage or be engaged in any capacity,  directly or indirectly  (as defined below), except as a passive investor owning less than a two percent (2%) interest in a publicly held company, in any business or entity that is competitive with the business of Wendy s or its affiliates.  This restriction includes any business engaged in drive through or food service restaurant business where hamburgers, chicken sandwiches or entree salads are predominant products (15% or more, individually or in the aggregate, of food products not including beverages). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this restriction shall not prohibit you from accepting employment, operating or otherwise becoming associated with a franchisee of Wendy s, any of its affiliates or any subsidiary of the foregoing, but only in connection with activities associated with the operation of such a franchise or activities that otherwise are not encompassed by the restrictions of this paragraph, subject to any confidentiality obligations contained herein; 
    
  (ii) you will not, directly or indirectly, without Wendy s prior written consent, hire or cause to be hired, solicit or encourage to cease to work with Wendy s or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, any person who is at the time of such activity, or who was within the six (6) month period preceding such activity, an employee of Wendy s or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates at the level of director or any more senior level or a  

Page 5 

consultant under contract with Wendy s or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates and whose primary client is such entity or entities; and  
    
  (iii) you will not, directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage or cause any franchisee or supplier of Wendy s or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to cease doing business with Wendy s or subsidiary or affiliate, or to reduce the amount of business such franchisee or supplier does with Wendy s or such subsidiary or affiliate. 
    
  For purposes of this section,    directly or indirectly    means in your individual capacity for your own benefit or as a shareholder, lender, partner, member or other principal, officer, director, employee, agent or consultant of or to any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust, association or any other entity whatsoever;   provided  ,   however  , that you may own stock in Wendy s and may operate, directly or indirectly, Wendy s restaurants as a franchisee without violating sections (i) or (iii). 
    
  If any competent authority having jurisdiction over this section determines that any of the provisions is unenforceable because of the duration or geographical scope of such provision, such competent authority shall have the power to reduce the duration or scope, as the case may be, of such provision and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable. In the event of your breach of your obligations under the post-employment restrictive covenants, then the post-employment restricted period shall be tolled and extended during the length of such breach, to the extent permitted by law.
