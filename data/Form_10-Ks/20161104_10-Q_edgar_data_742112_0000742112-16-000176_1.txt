  INVACARE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) - September 30, 2016 

Accounting Policies 
    
  Nature of Operations:   Invacare Corporation is a leading manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment used in the home based upon the company s distribution channels, breadth of product line and net sales. The company designs, manufactures and distributes an extensive line of health care products for the non-acute care environment, including the home health care, retail and extended care markets. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation:   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries and include all adjustments, which were of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the company as of   September 30, 2016   and the results of its operations and changes in its cash flow for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Certain foreign subsidiaries, represented by the European segment, are consolidated using an   August 31   quarter end in order to meet filing deadlines. No material subsequent events have occurred related to the European segment, which would require disclosure or adjustment to the company's financial statements. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. The results of operations   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
    
  Use of Estimates:   The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements:   In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08 changing the presentation of discontinued operations on the statements of income and other requirements for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new standard, a disposal of a component or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results when the component meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale or is disposed. The amendments in this update also require additional disclosures about discontinued operations and disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations. This standard was required to be prospectively applied to all reporting periods presented in financial reports issued after the effective date. This standard can impact the presentation of the company's financial statements but does not affect the calculation of net income, comprehensive income or earnings per share. The company adopted ASU 2014-08 effective January 1, 2015 which impacted the company s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss), Balance Sheets and Statement of Cash Flows. Specifically, the disposal by the company of its United States Rentals businesses, in the third quarter of 2015 and the   GCM   disposal in the third quarter of 2016, were not deemed to be discontinued operations.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2014-09 requires a company to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The guidance requires five steps to be applied: 1) identify the contract(s) with customers, 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The guidance also requires both quantitative and qualitative disclosures, which are more comprehensive than existing revenue standards. The disclosures are intended to enable financial statement users to understand the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and the related cash flow. An entity can apply the new revenue standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application in retained earnings. The new accounting guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, due to an approved one-year deferral, and early adoption is permitted. The company is currently reviewing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the company's financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs." ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, which is similar to the presentation of debt discounts or premiums. ASU 2015-03 does not change the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs and requires retrospective application to all periods presented upon adoption. Amortization of debt fees are reflected as interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). The company adopted ASU 2015-03 effective January 1, 2016 which did not have a material impact on the company's financial statements. See "Reclassifications" disclosure below for the amounts reclassified from Selling, General and Administrative expenses to Interest Expense.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) - September 30, 2016 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,  which requires management to assess the company's ability to continue as a going concern and, in certain circumstances, provide footnote disclosure. This update is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and all annual and interim periods thereafter. The company is currently reviewing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  to simplify the subsequent measurement of inventory. After effectiveness of this update, entities will be required to subsequently measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than at the lower of cost or market. This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. The company is currently reviewing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-11 on the company's financial statements but does not currently believe it will a material impact on the company's financial statements. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes." ASU 2015-17 requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent amounts on the balance sheet. The new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The company adopted ASU 2015-17, on a prospective basis, effective October 1, 2015 and thus the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities have been classified as long-term in its Balance Sheet for all periods presented. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases." ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheet while recognizing expense in a manner similar to existing accounting. The new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The company is currently reviewing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the company's financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation   Stock Compensation: Topic 718: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."  ASU 2016-09 is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This pronouncement is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The company does not believe the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have a material impact on the company's financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements." ASU 2016-13 requires a new credit loss standard for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For example, entities will be required to use an "expected loss" model that will generally require earlier recognition of allowances for losses for trade receivables. The standard also requires additional disclosures, including disclosures regarding how an entity tracks credit quality. The amendments in the pronouncement are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities may early adopt the amendments as of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The company is currently reviewing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on the company's financial statements. 
    
  Reclassifications:   The company has historically classified the amortization of debt issuance costs as a component of Selling, General and Administrative (SG A) Expenses. During the second quarter of 2016, the company determined that it is more appropriate to classify this amortization as a component of Interest Expense. Therefore, Interest Expense   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   has been increased by   $137,000   and   $997,000  , respectively, with a corresponding decrease to SG A expenses. The amortization of debt issuance costs of   $379,000   for the first three months of 2016 was previously included in SG A expenses but has now been included in Interest Expense. Total debt amortization fees for the   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $1,435,000  . There was no change to Loss from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes for any period presented. 

Operations Held For Sale 
  On   July 2, 2015  , Invacare Continuing Care, Inc., a Missouri Corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the company ("ICC") completed the sale (the "Transaction") of all the issued and outstanding membership interests in Dynamic Medical Systems, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, and Invacare Outcomes Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, each a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICC ( collectively, the rentals businesses ), pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) among the company, ICC and Joerns Healthcare Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The price paid to ICC for the rentals businesses was approximately   $15,500,000   in cash, which was subject to certain post-closing

adjustments required by the Purchase Agreement. Net proceeds from the Transaction were approximately   $13,700,000  , net of taxes and expenses. The company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately   $24,000   in the third quarter of 2015, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of the rentals businesses, as of the date of completion of the disposition. The company recorded expenses related to the sale of the rentals businesses totaling   $1,792,000  , of which   $1,264,000   have been paid as of   September 30, 2016  . The sale of the rentals businesses was not dilutive to the company's results. The company utilized the net proceeds from the sale to reduce debt outstanding under its credit agreement. The company determined that the sale of the rentals businesses did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASU 2014-08 but the "held for sale" criteria of ASC 360-10-45-9 were met and thus the rentals businesses were treated as held for sale as of   June 30, 2015   until sold on   July 2, 2015  . 
    
  On   September 30, 2016  , the company, completed the sale of its subsidiary, Garden City Medical Inc, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary (   GCM   ), dba PMI and Pinnacle Medsource, to Compass Health Brands Corp., a Delaware corporation (the  Purchaser ), pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement.   GCM   sourced and distributed primarily products under the brand ProBasics        by PMI. The price paid to the company for   GCM   was   $13,829,000   in cash and net proceeds from the transaction were   $12,729,000  , net of expenses. The company recorded a pre-tax gain of   $7,386,000   in the third quarter of 2016, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of   GCM  . The company recorded expenses related to the sale of   GCM   totaling   $1,100,000  , none of which was paid out as of   September 30, 2016  . The sale of   GCM   will be dilutive to the company's results. The company will utilize the net proceeds to fund operations. The company determined that the sale of   GCM   did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASU 2014-08 but the "held for sale" criteria of ASC 360-10-45-9 were met and thus   GCM   was treated as held for sale for purposes of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015. 
    
  The assets and liabilities of   GCM   that were sold on September 30, 2016 and shown as held for sale as of December 31, 2015 in the company's Consolidated Balance Sheets were comprised of the following (in thousands): 

With the sale of   GCM  , the company entered into an agreement with the Purchaser for the Purchaser to buy, at cost, all ProBasics        inventory capitalized on the balance sheets of certain Invacare subsidiaries which was not sold as part of the   GCM   sale on September 30, 2016. The value of this inventory as of September 30, 2016 was approximately   $2,400,000   and the company anticipates all of this inventory will be transferred to the Purchaser in the fourth quarter of 2016. Under the agreement, depending on certain conditions, the Purchaser may have until September 30, 2017 to pay for the inventory. 

Discontinued Operations 
  From 2012 through 2014, the company sold three businesses which were classified as discontinued operations.  The company recorded cumulative expenses related to the sale of discontinued operations totaling   $8,801,000  , of which   $8,405,000   have been paid as of   September 30, 2016  .The company recorded an incremental intra-period tax allocation expense to discontinued operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   which represented the cumulative intra-period allocation expense to discontinued operations based on the company's prior year estimate of the projected domestic taxable loss related to continuing operations for 2015.

Receivables 
    
  Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. Substantially all of the company s receivables are due from health care, medical equipment providers and long term care facilities located throughout the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, China and Europe. A significant portion of products sold to providers, both foreign and domestic, are ultimately funded through government reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S. As a consequence, changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on dealer liquidity and profitability.  
    
  The estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts ($  7,346,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   $9,726,000   at   December 31, 2015  ) is based primarily on management s evaluation of the financial condition of specific customers. In addition, as a result of the company's financing arrangement with De Lage Landen, Inc. ("DLL"), a third party financing company which the company has worked with since 2000, management monitors the collection status of these contracts in accordance with the company s limited recourse obligations and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts and establishes reserves for specific customers as needed. The company writes off uncollectible trade accounts receivable after such receivables are moved to collection status and legal remedies are exhausted. See Concentration of Credit Risk in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the financing arrangement. Long-term installment receivables are included in  Other Assets  on the consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  The company s U.S. customers electing to finance their purchases can do so using DLL. In addition, the company often provides financing directly for its Canadian customers for which DLL is not an option, as DLL typically provides financing to Canadian customers only on a limited basis. The installment receivables recorded on the books of the company represent a single portfolio segment of finance receivables to the independent provider channel and long-term care customers. The portfolio segment is comprised of two classes of receivables distinguished by geography and credit quality. The U.S. installment receivables are the first class and represent installment receivables re-purchased from DLL because the customers were in default. Default with DLL is defined as a customer being delinquent by   three   payments. The Canadian installment receivables represent the second class of installment receivables which were originally financed by the company because third party financing was not available to the HME providers. The Canadian installment receivables are typically financed for   twelve   months and historically have had a very low risk of default. 
    
  The estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts and evaluation for impairment for both classes of installment receivables is based on the company s quarterly review of the financial condition of each individual customer with the allowance for doubtful accounts adjusted accordingly. Installments are individually and not collectively reviewed for impairment. The company assesses the bad debt reserve levels based upon the status of the customer s adherence to legally negotiated payment schedule and the company s ability to enforce judgments, liens, etc. 
    
  For purposes of granting or extending credit, the company utilizes a scoring model to generate a composite score that considers each customer s consumer credit score and/or D B credit rating, payment history, security collateral and time in business. Additional analysis is performed for most customers desiring credit greater than   $250,000  , which generally includes a detailed review of the customer s financial statements as well as consideration of other factors such as exposure to changing reimbursement laws. 
    
  Interest income is recognized on installment receivables based on the terms of the installment agreements. Installment accounts are monitored and if a customer defaults on payments and is moved to collection, interest income is no longer recognized. Subsequent payments received once an account is put on non-accrual status are generally first applied to the principal balance and then to the interest. Accruing of interest on collection accounts would only be restarted if the account became current again.  
    
  All installment accounts are accounted for using the same methodology regardless of the duration of the installment agreements. When an account is placed in collection status, the company goes through a legal process for pursuing collection of outstanding amounts, the length of which typically approximates   eighteen months  . Any write-offs are made after the legal process has been completed. The company has not made any changes to either its accounting policies or methodology to estimate allowances for doubtful accounts in the last twelve months.

Installment receivables with a related allowance recorded as noted in the table above represent those installment receivables on a non-accrual basis in accordance with ASU 2010-20.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the company had no U.S. installment receivables past due of   90   days or more for which the company is still accruing interest. Individually, all U.S. installment receivables are assigned a specific allowance for doubtful accounts based on management s review when the company does not expect to receive both the contractual principal and interest payments as specified in the loan agreement. In Canada, the company had an immaterial amount of Canadian installment receivables which were past due of   90   days or more as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for which the company is still accruing interest.

Goodwill 
  The change in goodwill from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was due to foreign currency translation. 

Intangibles 
    
  All of the company s intangible assets have been assigned definite lives and continue to be amortized over their useful lives, except for   $25,233,000   related to trademarks, which have indefinite lives. The changes in intangible balances reflected on the balance sheet from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   were the result of foreign currency translation and amortization. 
    
  The company evaluates the carrying value of definite-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Definite-lived assets are determined to be impaired if the future un-discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value. Actual impairment amounts for definite-lived assets are then calculated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The company reviews indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Any impairment amounts for indefinite-lived assets are calculated as the difference between the future discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset less than the carrying value for the asset.  
    
  The company's intangibles consist of the following (in thousands): 

Amortization expense related to intangibles was   $1,235,000   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and is estimated to be   $1,637,000   in   2016  ,   $1,563,000   in   2017  ,   $1,542,000   in   2018  ,   $1,222,000   in   2019  ,   $182,000   in   2020   and   $182,000   in   2021  . Amortized intangibles are being amortized on a straight-line basis over remaining lives of   1   to   10   years with the majority of the intangibles being amortized over an average remaining life of approximately   5   years.

Accrued Expenses 
    
  Accrued expenses consist of accruals for the following (in thousands): 

Accrued rebates relate to several volume incentive programs the company offers its customers. The company accounts for these rebates as a reduction of revenue when the products are sold in accordance with the guidance in ASC 605-50, C  ustomer Payments and Incentives  . 
    
  Generally, the company's products are covered by warranties against defects in material and workmanship for various periods depending on the product from the date of sales to the customer. Certain components carry a lifetime warranty. A provision for estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time of sale based upon actual experience. The company continuously assesses the adequacy of its product warranty accrual and makes adjustments as needed. Historical analysis is primarily used to determine the company's warranty reserves. Claims history is reviewed and provisions are adjusted as needed. However, the company does consider other events, such product field actions and recalls, which could warrant additional warranty reserve provision. 
    
  In 2016, the company recorded additional warranty expense of   $1,220,000   for a product recall which was related to a component on a lifestyles product, recorded in the North America/HME segment, and an additional warranty expense of   $1,670,000   for a component of a lifestyles product which was recorded in the European segment. The company's warranty reserves are subject to adjustment in future periods to the extent that new developments change the company's estimate of the total cost of these matters. 
  The following is a reconciliation of the changes in accrued warranty costs for the reporting period (in thousands):

  On   September 30, 2015   the company entered into an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ), amending and restating the company s existing Revolving Credit and Security Agreement which was originally entered into on   January 16, 2015   and amended on   April 22, 2015   (the  Original Credit Agreement ) and which matures in   January 2018  . The Credit Agreement was entered into by and among the company, certain of the company s direct and indirect U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries and certain of the company s European subsidiaries (together with the company, the  Borrowers ), certain other of the company s direct and indirect U.S., Canadian and European subsidiaries (the  Guarantors ), and PNC Bank, National Association ( PNC ), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P.

the amendment of the negative covenant to permit the repurchase by the company of up to   $5,000,000   of its common shares (which were subsequently repurchased in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes) so long as the company is not, and would not after giving pro-forma effect to any such repurchase be, in default under the Credit Agreement and has had undrawn availability equal to at least   20%   of the maximum revolving advance amount under its North American-based credit facility (which maximum amount was   $100,000,000   at September 30, 2016) for the   30   consecutive days ending as of the date of the most recent North American borrowing base certificate delivered by the company under the Credit Agreement;

    the amendment of the availability block (which affects the company s borrowing base) by reducing the block from   $10,000,000   to   $5,000,000  , the effect of which is to increase borrowing capacity. 
       
  U.S. and Canadian Borrowers Credit Facility 
    
  For the company's U.S. and Canadian Borrowers, the Credit Agreement provides for an asset-based-lending senior secured revolving credit facility which is secured by substantially all of the company s U.S. and Canadian assets, other than real estate. The Credit Agreement provides the company and the other Borrowers with a credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of   $100,000,000  , subject to availability based on a borrowing base formula, under a senior secured revolving credit, letter of credit and swing line loan facility (the  U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility ). Up to   $25,000,000   of the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility will be available for issuance of letters of credit. The aggregate principal amount of the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility may be increased by up to   $25,000,000   to the extent requested by the company and agreed to by any Lender or new financial institution approved by the Administrative Agent. The aggregate borrowing availability under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility is determined based on a borrowing base formula set forth in the Credit Agreement and summarized below. 
    
  Under the Credit Agreement, the aggregate usage under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of (a)   85%   of eligible U.S. accounts receivable   plus   (b) the lesser of (i)   70%   of eligible U.S. inventory and eligible foreign in-transit inventory and (ii)   85%   of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible U.S. inventory and eligible foreign in-transit inventory (not to exceed   $4,000,000  ),   plus   (c) the lesser of (i)   85%   of the net orderly liquidation value of U.S. eligible machinery and equipment and (ii)   $2,631,000   (subject to reduction as provided in the Credit Agreement),   plus   (d)   85%   of eligible Canadian accounts receivable,   plus   (e) the lesser of (i)   70%   of eligible Canadian inventory and (ii)   85%   of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible Canadian inventory,   less   (f)  swing loans outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility,   less   (g) letters of credit issued and undrawn under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility,   less   (h) a   $5,000,000   minimum availability reserve,   less   (i) other reserves required by the Administrative Agent, and in each case subject to the definitions and limitations in the Credit Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the company was in compliance with all covenant requirements and had borrowing capacity on the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility under the Credit Agreement of   $38,687,000  , taking into account the   $5,000,000   minimum availability reserve, then-outstanding letters of credit, other reserves and the   $11,250,000   dominion trigger amount described below. 
    
  Interest will accrue on outstanding indebtedness under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility at the LIBOR rate, plus a margin ranging from   2.25%   to   2.75%  , or for swing line loans, at the alternate base rate, plus a margin ranging from   1.25%   to   1.75%  , as selected by the company. The margin will be adjusted quarterly based on utilization. Borrowings under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility are subject to commitment fees of   0.25%   or   0.375%   per year, depending on utilization.

The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. Exceptions to the operating covenants in the Credit Agreement provide the company with flexibility to, among other things, enter into or undertake certain sale and leaseback transactions, dispositions of assets, additional credit facilities, sales of receivables, additional indebtedness and intercompany indebtedness, all subject to limitations set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains a covenant requiring the company to maintain minimum availability under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility of not less than the greater of (i)   11.25%   of the maximum amount that may be drawn under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility for five (  5  ) consecutive business days, or (ii)   $5,000,000   on any business day. The company also is subject to dominion triggers under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility requiring the company to maintain borrowing capacity of not less than   $11,250,000   on any business day or   $12,500,000   for five consecutive days in order to avoid triggering full control by an agent for the lenders of the company's cash receipts for application to the company s obligations under the agreement. 
    
  The Credit Agreement contains customary default provisions, with certain grace periods and exceptions, which provide that events of default that include, among other things, failure to pay amounts due, breach of covenants, representations or warranties, bankruptcy, the occurrence of a material adverse effect, exclusion from any medical reimbursement program, and an interruption of any material manufacturing facilities for more than   10   consecutive days.

  European Credit Facility 
    
  The Credit Agreement also provides for a revolving credit, letter of credit and swing line loan facility which gives the European Borrowers the ability to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of   $30,000,000  , with a   $5,000,000   sublimit for letters of credit and a   $2,000,000   sublimit for swing line loans (the  European Credit Facility ). Up to   $15,000,000   of the European Credit Facility will be available to each of Invacare Limited (the  UK Borrower ) and Invacare Poirier SAS (the  French Borrower  and, together with the UK Borrower, the  European Borrowers ). The European Credit Facility matures in January 2018, together with the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility. The aggregate borrowing availability for each European Borrower under the European Credit Facility is determined based on a borrowing base formula set forth in the Credit Agreement and summarized below. Under the Credit Agreement, the aggregate borrowings of each of the European Borrowers under the European Credit Facility may not exceed an amount equal to (a)   85%   of the European Borrower s eligible accounts receivable,   less   (b) the European Borrower s borrowings and swing line loans outstanding under the European Credit Facility,   less   (c) the European Borrower s letters of credit issued and undrawn under the European Credit Facility,   less   (d) a   $3,000,000   minimum availability reserve,   less   (e) other reserves required by the European Agent, and in each case subject to the definitions and limitations in the Credit Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate borrowing availability to the European Borrowers under the European Credit Facility was approximately   $16,256,000  , taking into account the   $3,000,000   minimum availability reserve and the   $3,375,000   dominion trigger amount described below. 
    
  The aggregate principal amount of the European Credit Facility may be increased by up to   $10,000,000   to the extent requested by the company and agreed to by any Lender or Lenders that wish to increase their lending participation or, if not agreed to by any Lender, a new financial institution that agrees to join the European Credit Facility and that is approved by the Administrative Agent and the European Agent. 
    
  Interest will accrue on outstanding indebtedness under the European Credit Facility at the LIBOR rate, plus a margin ranging from   2.50%   to   3.00%  , or for swing line loans, at the overnight LIBOR rate, plus a margin ranging from   2.50%   to   3.00%  , as selected by the company. The margin that will be adjusted quarterly based on utilization. Borrowings under the European Credit Facility are subject to commitment fees of   0.25%   or   0.375%   per year, depending on utilization.  
    
  The European Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the personal property assets of the UK Borrower and its in-country subsidiaries, and all of the receivables of the French Borrower and its in-country subsidiaries. The UK and French facilities (which comprise the European Credit Facility) are cross collateralized, and the US personal property assets previously pledged under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility also serve as collateral for the European Credit Facility.  
    
  The European Credit Facility is subject to customary representations, warranties and covenants generally consistent with those applicable to the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility. Exceptions to the operating covenants in the Credit Agreement provide the company with flexibility to, among other things, enter into or undertake certain sale/leaseback transactions, dispositions of assets, additional credit facilities, sales of receivables, additional indebtedness and intercompany indebtedness, all subject to

  Convertible senior subordinated debentures due 2027 
    
  In   2007  , the company issued   $135,000,000   principal amount of   4.125%   Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures due   2027   (the "debentures"), of which   $13,350,000   principal amount remains outstanding. The debentures are unsecured senior subordinated obligations of the company, pay interest at   4.125%   per annum on each   February 1   and   August 1  , and are convertible upon satisfaction of certain conditions into cash, common shares of the company, or a combination of cash and common shares of the company, subject to certain conditions. The debentures allow the company to satisfy any such conversion using any combination of cash or stock, and at the company s discretion. In the event of such a conversion, the company intends to satisfy the accreted value of the debentures using cash. Assuming adequate cash on hand at the time of conversion, the company also intends to satisfy the conversion spread using cash, as opposed to stock.  
    
  The liability components of the debentures consist of the following (in thousands): 

In the first quarter of 2016, the company executed a release, acknowledged by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, effecting the release as guarantors of all of the company s subsidiaries that were guarantors of the debentures, issued pursuant to the terms of the indenture, dated as of   February 12, 2007  , between the company and the trustee.  
  Convertible senior notes due 2021 
    
  In the first quarter of 2016, the company issued   $150,000,000   aggregate principal amount of   5.00%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the  notes ) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The notes bear interest at a rate of   5.00%   per year payable semi-annually in arrears on   February 15   and   August 15   of each year, beginning   August 15, 2016  . The notes will mature on   February 15, 2021  , unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to   August 15, 2020  , the notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Unless and until the company obtains shareholder approval under applicable New York Stock Exchange rules, the notes will be convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash. If the company obtains such shareholder approval, the notes may be settled in cash, the company s common shares or a combination of cash and the company s common shares, at the company s election. Holders of the notes will have the right to require the company to repurchase all or some of their notes at   100%   of their principal, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes. The initial conversion rate is   60.0492   common shares per   $1,000   principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately   $16.65

per common share). The company evaluated the terms of the conversion features under the applicable accounting literature, including   Derivatives and Hedging  , ASC 815, and determined that the features did require separate accounting as a derivative.  This derivative was capitalized on the balance sheet as a long-term liability and will be adjusted to reflect fair value each quarter.  The fair value of the convertible debt conversion liability at issuance was   $34,480,000  . The fair value of the convertible debt conversion liability at   September 30, 2016   was   $20,901,000  . The company recognized   gain  s of   $7,732,000   and   $13,579,000     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.     
    
  In connection with the offering of the notes, the company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with two financial institutions (the  option counterparties ). These transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of the company s common shares that will initially underlie the notes, and are expected generally to reduce the potential equity dilution, and/or offset any cash payments in excess of the principal amount due, as the case may be, upon conversion of the notes. The company evaluated the note hedges under the applicable accounting literature, including   Derivatives and Hedging  , ASC 815, and determined that the note hedges should be accounted for as derivatives.  These derivatives were capitalized on the balance sheet as long-term assets and will be adjusted to reflect fair value each quarter. The fair value of the convertible note hedge assets at issuance was   $27,975,000  .  The fair value of the convertible note hedge assets at   September 30, 2016   was   $16,678,000  . The company recognized   loss  es of   $6,540,000   and   $11,297,000     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
    
  The company entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the option counterparties at a higher strike price relating to the same number of the company s common shares, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, pursuant to which the company sold warrants to the option counterparties. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on the company s outstanding common shares and the company s earnings per share to the extent that the price of the company s common shares exceeds the strike price of those warrants. The initial strike price of the warrants is   $22.4175   per share and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the warrant transactions. The company evaluated the warrants under the applicable accounting literature, including   Derivatives and Hedging  , ASC 815, and determined that the warrants meet the definition of a derivative, are indexed to the company's own stock and should be classified in shareholder's equity. The amount paid for the warrants and capitalized in shareholder's equity was   $12,376,000  .  
    
  The net proceeds from the offering of the notes were approximately   $144,034,000  , after deducting fees and offering expenses of   $5,966,000  . These debt issuance costs were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense through February 2021.  As of   September 30, 2016  , all   $5,966,000   of these costs were paid.  In accordance with ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , these debt issuance costs are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability.  Approximately   $5,000,000   of the net proceeds from the offering were used to repurchase the company s common shares from purchasers of notes in the offering in privately negotiated transactions. A portion of the net proceeds from the offering were used to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions (after such cost is partially offset by the proceeds to the company from the warrant transactions), which net cost was   $15,600,000  . 
    
  The liability components of the notes consist of the following (in thousands): 

The unamortized discount of   $31,330,000   is to be amortized through February 2021. The effective interest rate on the liability component was   11.1%  . Non-cash interest expense of   $1,362,000   and   $3,150,000   was recognized   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, in comparison to actual interest expense accrued of   $1,875,000   and   $4,503,000  , for the same periods respectively, based on the stated coupon rate of   5.0%  . The notes were not convertible as of   September 30, 2016   nor was the applicable conversion threshold met.

  On   April 23, 2015  , the company entered into a real estate sale leaseback transaction which resulted in the company recording an initial deferred gain of   $7,414,000  , the majority of which is included in Other Long-Term Obligations and will be recognized over the 20-year life of the leases. The gain realized for the three months and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $67,000   and   $198,000  , respectively.  The gain realized   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was   $67,000   and   $109,000  , respectively. 

Equity Compensation 
    
  On   May 16, 2013  , the shareholders of the company approved the Invacare Corporation 2013 Equity Compensation Plan (the  2013 Plan ), which was adopted on   March 27, 2013   by the company's Board of Directors (the  Board ). The Board adopted the 2013 Plan to replace the company's prior equity plan, the Invacare Corporation Amended and Restated 2003 Performance Plan (the  2003 Plan ), which expired on   May 21, 2013  . Due to its expiration, no new awards may be granted under the 2003 Plan; however, awards granted prior to its expiration will remain outstanding until they are exercised, vest, terminate or expire in accordance with their terms. 
  The 2013 Plan uses a fungible share-counting method, under which each common share underlying an award of stock options or stock appreciation rights ( SAR ) will count against the number of total shares available under the 2013 Plan as one share; and each common share underlying any award other than a stock option or a SAR will count against the number of total shares available under the 2013 Plan as two shares. Any common shares that are added back to the 2013 Plan as the result of the cancellation or forfeiture of an award granted under the 2013 Plan will be added back in the same manner such shares were originally counted against the total number of shares available under the 2013 Plan.  Each common share that is added back to the 2013 Plan due to a cancellation or forfeiture of an award granted under the 2003 Plan will be added back as one common share. 
  The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board (the  Compensation Committee ), in its discretion, may grant an award under the 2013 Plan to any director or employee of the company or an affiliate. The 2013 Plan initially allows the Compensation Committee to grant up to   4,460,337   common shares in connection with the following types of awards with respect to shares of the company's common shares: incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, SARs, restricted stock, restricted stock units, unrestricted stock and performance shares. The Compensation Committee also may grant performance units that are payable in cash. The Committee has the authority to determine which participants will receive awards, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards.

The 2013 Plan provides that shares granted come from the company's authorized but unissued common shares or treasury shares. In addition, the company's stock-based compensation plans allow employee participants to exchange shares for minimum withholding taxes, which results in the company acquiring treasury shares.  
  The amounts of equity-based compensation expense recognized as part of selling, general and administrative expenses were as follows (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized compensation expense related to equity-based compensation arrangements granted under the company's 2013 Plan and previous plans, which is related to non-vested options and shares, was as follows (in thousands): 

Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in actual and estimated forfeitures and for updated vesting assumptions for the performance share awards (see "Performance Shares and Performance Share Units" below). No tax benefit for share-based compensation was realized   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   as a result of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. In accordance with ASC 718, any tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized is classified as a component of financing cash flows. 
  Stock Options 
    
  Generally, non-qualified stock option awards have a term of   ten   years and were granted with an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value of one of the company s Common Shares on the date of grant. The company expects the compensation expense to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   two years  . The following table summarizes information about stock option activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :

The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at   September 30, 2016  : 

Pursuant to the plans, the Committee has established that grants may not be exercised within one year from the date granted and options must be exercised within ten years from the date granted. The company has not issued stock options since 2014. However, for stock options issued in 2014 and prior,   25%   of such options vested one year following the issuance and provided a   four  -year vesting period whereby options vest in   25%   installments in each year. Options granted with graded vesting were accounted for as single options.  
    
  The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with assumptions for expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected life. The assumed expected life was based on the company's historical analysis of option history. The expected stock price volatility was also based on actual historical volatility, and expected dividend yield was based on historical dividends as the company had no current intention of changing its dividend policy. 
    
  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units 
    
  The following table summarizes information about restricted shares and restricted share units (for non-U.S. recipients): 

The restricted stock awards generally vest ratably over the three years after the award date, except for those awards granted in 2014, which vest after a three-year period. Unearned restricted stock compensation, determined as the market value of the shares at the date of grant, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Performance Shares and Performance Share Units 
    
  The following table summarizes information about performance shares and performance share units (for non-U.S. recipients): 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , performance shares and performance share units (for non-U.S. recipients) were granted as performance awards with a   three  -year performance period with payouts based on achievement of certain performance goals. The awards are classified as equity awards as they will be settled in common shares upon vesting. The number of shares earned will be determined at the end of the performance period based on achievement of performance criteria for January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 established by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant. Recipients will be entitled to receive a number of common shares equal to the number of performance shares that vest based upon the levels of achievement which may range between   0%   and   150%   of the target number of shares with the target being   100%   of the initial grant.  
    
  The fair value of the performance awards is based on the stock price on the date of grant discounted for the estimated value of dividends foregone as the awards are not eligible for dividends except to the extent vested. The company assesses the probability that the performance targets will be met with expense recognized whenever it is probable that at least the minimum performance criteria will be achieved. Depending upon the company's assessment of the probability of achievement of the goals, the company may not recognize any expense associated with performance awards in a given period, may reverse prior expense recorded or record additional expense to make up for expense not recorded in a prior period. Performance award compensation expense is generally expected to be recognized over   three   years. No performance award expense has been recognized for the 2015 and 2014 awards as it is not considered probable that the performance goals for those awards will be met.

Charges Related to Restructuring Activities 
    
  The company's restructuring charges recorded since 2011 were necessitated primarily by continued declines in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement by the U.S. government, as well as similar healthcare reimbursement pressures abroad, which negatively affect the company's customers (e.g. home health care providers) and continued pricing pressures faced by the company as a result of outsourcing by competitors to lower cost locations. In addition, restructuring decisions were also the result of reduced profitability in the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific segments. The company expects any near-term cost savings from restructuring will be offset by other costs as a result of pressures on the business.  
    
  The company's restructuring commenced in the second quarter of 2011 with the company's decision to close the Hong, Denmark assembly facility as part of the company's ongoing globalization initiative to reduce complexity in the company's supply chain, which is intended to reduce expenses to help offset pricing pressures. In the third quarter of 2011, the company continued to execute on the closure of the Hong, Denmark assembly facility and initiated the closure of a smaller facility in the U.S. Charges for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 were primarily incurred at the company's corporate headquarters for severance, with additional costs incurred as a result of the closure of the Hong, Denmark facility.  The facility closures were completed in 2012 in addition to the elimination of various positions principally in the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific segments. 
    
  Charges for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled   $10,534,000   including charges for severance (  $8,352,000  ), contract exit costs primarily related to the closure of the Hong, Denmark assembly facility (  $1,788,000  ) and inventory write-offs (  $277,000  ) recorded in cost of products sold and other miscellaneous costs (  $117,000  ). The majority of the 2011 North America/HME charges were incurred for severance, primarily at the corporate headquarters as the result of the elimination of various positions principally in sales and administration in Elyria, Ohio. These eliminations were permanent reductions in workforce that primarily resulted in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses. In Europe, the charges were the result of the closure of the company's Hong, Denmark facility. The assembly activities were transferred to other company facilities or outsourced to third parties. This closure enabled the company to reduce fixed operating costs related to the facility and reduce headcount with the transfer of a portion of the production to other company facilities. The 2011 charges have been paid out. 
    
  Charges for the year ended December 31, 2012 totaled   $11,395,000   including charges for severance (  $6,775,000  ), lease termination costs (  $1,725,000  ), building and asset write-downs, primarily related to the closure of the Hong, Denmark assembly facility, and other miscellaneous charges in Europe and Asia/Pacific (  $2,404,000  ) and inventory write-offs (  $491,000  ) in Asia/Pacific recorded in cost of products sold. Severance charges were primarily incurred in the North America/HME segment (  $4,242,000  ), Asia/Pacific segment (  $1,681,000  ) and Europe segment (  $817,000  ). A portion of the North America/HME segment severance was related to positions eliminated, principally in sales and marketing as well as manufacturing, at the company's Taylor Street facility as a result of the FDA consent decree. The savings from these charges were reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. In Europe, positions were eliminated as a result of finalizing the exit from the manufacturing facility in Denmark and an elimination of a senior management position in Switzerland. In Asia/Pacific, at the end of October 2012, the company's management approved a plan to restructure the company's operations in this segment. In Australia, the company consolidated offices / warehouses, decreased staffing and exited various activities while returning to a focus on distribution. At the company's subsidiary, which produces microprocessor controllers, the company decided to cease the contract manufacturing business for companies outside of the healthcare industry.  Payments for the year ended December 31, 2012 were   $9,381,000   and were funded with operating cash flows. The 2012 charges have been paid out. 
    
  Charges for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled   $9,336,000   including charges for severance (  $8,282,000  ), lease termination costs (  $698,000  ) and other miscellaneous charges principally in North America/HME (  $356,000  ). Severance charges were primarily incurred in the North America/HME segment (  $5,405,000  ), Europe segment (  $1,640,000  ) and Asia/Pacific segment (  $970,000  ). The charges were incurred as a result of the elimination of various positions as part of the company's globalization initiatives. North America/HME segment severance was principally related to positions eliminated due to lost sales volumes resulting from the impact of the FDA consent decree. The savings from these charges were reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. In Europe, severance was incurred for the elimination of certain sales and supply chain positions. In Asia/Pacific, severance was principally incurred at the company's subsidiary, which produces microprocessor controllers, as a result of the company's decision in 2012 to cease the contract manufacturing business for companies outside of the healthcare industry. The lease termination costs were principally related to Australia as a result of the restructuring announced in 2012. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2013 were   $11,844,000   and were funded with operating cash flows and cash on hand. The 2013 charges have been paid out.

Charges for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled   $11,112,000   including charges for severance (  $9,841,000  ), other charges in IPG and Europe (  $1,286,000  ) principally related to building write-downs, and lease termination cost reversals (  $15,000  ). Severance charges were incurred in the North America/HME segment (  $4,404,000  ), Other (  $2,978,000  ), IPG segment (  $1,163,000  ), Asia/Pacific segment (  $769,000  ) and Europe segment (  $527,000  ). The North America/HME segment severance was principally related to additional positions eliminated due to lost sales volumes resulting from the continued impact of the FDA consent decree. The Other severance related to the elimination of two senior corporate executive positions. IPG segment severance related principally to the closure of the London, Canada facility. Europe and Asia/Pacific severance related to the elimination of certain positions as a result of general restructuring efforts. The savings from these charges will be reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2014 were   $11,131,000   and were funded with operating cash flows and cash on hand. The majority of the 2014 charges have been paid out other than certain executive charge payments which will be paid out over the next few years.  
  Charges for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled   $1,971,000   including charges for severance (  $1,678,000  ) and charges primarily in the North America/HME segment (  $293,000  ) principally related to a building lease termination. Severance charges were incurred in the North America/HME segment (  $1,069,000  ), Europe segment (  $510,000  ), IPG segment (  $73,000  ) and Asia/Pacific segment (  $26,000  ) related to the elimination of certain positions as a result of general restructuring efforts. The savings from these charges will be reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2015 were   $3,723,000   and were funded with operating cash flows and cash on hand. The majority of the 2015 charges are expected to be paid out in 2016. 
  Restructuring charges continued in 2016 resulting in charges of   $1,299,000   in the first   nine   months of   2016   related to severance costs incurred in the North America/HME segment (  $808,000  ) and the Asia/Pacific segment (  $86,000  ) and building lease termination costs in the North America/HME segment (  $405,000  ). Restructuring payments/utilization for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $2,190,000   and the cash payments were funded with company's cash on hand. The majority of the 2016 charges are expected to be paid out within   twelve   months. 
  There have been no material changes in accrued balances related to the charges, either as a result of revisions to the plans or changes in estimates. In addition, the savings anticipated as a result of the company's restructuring plans have been or are expected to be achieved, primarily resulting in reduced salary and benefit costs principally impacting Selling, General and Administrative expenses, and to a lesser extent, Costs of Products Sold. However, in general, these savings have been more than offset by the general business decline, higher regulatory and compliance costs related to quality system improvements, and more recently, higher interest expense. To date, the company's liquidity has not been materially impacted.  
  A progression by reporting segment of the accruals recorded as a result of the restructuring is as follows (in thousands):

  The company had an effective tax rate of   743.7%   and   48.2%   on losses before tax from continuing operations   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to an expected benefit at the U.S. statutory rate of   35%   on the continuing operations pre-tax losses for each period. The company's effective tax rate   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was unfavorable as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate expected benefit, principally due to the negative impact of the company not being able to record tax benefits related to the significant losses in countries which had tax valuation allowances. The effective tax rate was reduced by certain taxes outside the United States, excluding countries with tax valuation allowances, that were at an effective rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate.

For both the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, there were no shares necessary to settle a conversion spread on the convertible notes due February 2027 to be included in the common shares assuming dilution as the average market price of the company stock for these periods did not exceed the conversion price. In addition, no shares were included in the common shares assuming dilution related to the company's issued warrants as the average market price of the company stock for these periods did not exceed the strike price of the warrants. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 
    
  The company manufactures and distributes durable medical equipment to the home health care, retail and extended care markets. The company performs credit evaluations of its customers  financial condition. The company utilizes De Lage Landen, Inc. ( DLL ), a third party financing company, to provide the majority of future lease financing to the company s North America customers. The DLL agreement provides for direct leasing between DLL and the Invacare customer. The company retains a recourse obligation of   $6,221,000   at   September 30, 2016   to DLL for events of default under the contracts, which total   $36,039,000   at   September 30, 2016  .   Guarantees,   ASC 460, requires the company to record a guarantee liability as it relates to the limited recourse obligation. The company's recourse is re-evaluated by DLL biannually, considering activity between the biannual dates and excluding any receivables repurchased by the company from DLL. The company monitors the collections status of these contracts and has provided amounts for estimated losses in its allowances for doubtful accounts in accordance with   Receivables,   ASC 310-10-05-4  .   Credit losses are provided for in the financial statements. 
    
  Substantially all of the company s receivables are due from health care, medical equipment providers and long term care facilities located throughout the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Europe. A significant portion of products sold to dealers, both foreign and domestic, is ultimately funded through government reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The company has also seen a significant shift in reimbursement to customers from managed care entities. As a consequence, changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on dealer liquidity and profitability. In addition, reimbursement guidelines in the home health care industry have a substantial impact on the nature and type of equipment an end user can obtain as well as the timing of reimbursement and, thus, affect the product mix, pricing and payment patterns of the company s customers. 

Derivatives 
    
  ASC 815 requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheet as either assets or liabilities at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative is dependent upon whether or not the derivative has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment and the type of hedging relationship. For derivatives designated and qualifying as hedging instruments, the company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedging Strategy 
    
  The company uses derivative instruments in an attempt to manage its exposure to transactional foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. Foreign forward exchange contracts are used to manage the price risk associated with forecasted sales denominated in foreign currencies and the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of inventory generally over the next twelve months. 
    
  The company recognizes its derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet measured at fair value. A majority of the company s derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item, if any, is recognized in current earnings during the period of change. 
    
  To protect against increases/decreases in forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from inventory purchases/sales generally over the next year, the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge portions of its forecasted purchases/sales denominated in foreign currencies. The gains and losses are included in cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). If it is later determined that a hedged forecasted transaction is unlikely to occur, any prospective gains or losses on the forward contracts would be recognized in earnings.

The company does not expect any material amount of hedge ineffectiveness related to forward contract cash flow hedges during the periods covered by the hedges. 
    
  The company has historically not recognized any material amount of ineffectiveness related to forward contract cash flow hedges because the company generally limits its hedges to between   50%   and   90%   of total forecasted transactions for a given entity s exposure to currency rate changes and the transactions hedged are recurring in nature. Furthermore, the majority of the hedged transactions are related to intercompany sales and purchases for which settlement occurs on a specific day each month. Forward contracts with a total notional amount in USD of   $59,663,000   and   $171,889,000   matured   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $38,020,000   and   $100,657,000   matured   for the three and nine months ended   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts qualifying and designated for hedge accounting treatment were as follows (in thousands USD):

Derivatives Not Qualifying or Designated for Hedge Accounting Treatment 
    
  The company also utilizes foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedges in accordance with ASC 815. These contracts are entered into to eliminate the risk associated with the settlement of short-term intercompany trading receivables and payables between Invacare Corporation and its foreign subsidiaries. The currency forward contracts are entered into at the same time as the intercompany receivables or payables are created so that upon settlement, the gain/loss on the settlement is offset by the gain/loss on the foreign currency forward contract. No material net gain or loss was realized by the company in   2016   or   2015   related to these contracts and the associated short-term intercompany trading receivables and payables.

The gains or losses recognized as the result of the settlement of cash flow hedge foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in net sales for hedges of inventory sales and in cost of product sold for hedges of inventory purchases. For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net sales were   increased   by   $1,417,000   and   $2,826,000   while cost of product sold was   increased   by   $619,000   and   $1,576,000   for net pre-tax realized   gain  s of   $798,000   and   $1,250,000  , respectively. For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , net sales were   decreased   by   $1,087,000   and   $1,865,000   while cost of product sold was   decreased   by   $971,000   and   $2,935,000   for a net realized pre-tax   loss   of   $116,000   and a net realized pre-tax gain of   $1,070,000  , respectively. 
    
  A   gain   of   $271,000   and a loss of   $106,000   were recognized in selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   gain  s of   $172,000   and   $113,000     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, principally related to forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments that were entered into to offset gains/losses that were also recorded in SG A expenses on intercompany trade receivables or payables. Any gains/losses on the non-designated hedging instruments were substantially offset by gains/losses also recorded in SG A expenses on intercompany trade payables. 
    
  The company's derivative agreements provide the counterparties with a right of set off in the event of a default that would enable the counterparty to offset any net payment due by the counterparty to the company under the applicable agreement by any amount due by the company to the counterparty under any other agreement. For example, the terms of the agreement would permit a counterparty to a derivative contract that is also a lender under the company's Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to reduce any derivative settlement amounts owed to the company under the derivative contract by any amounts owed to the counterparty

by the company under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. In addition, the agreements contain cross-default provisions that could trigger a default by the company under the agreement in the event of a default by the company under another agreement with the same counterparty. The company does not present any derivatives on a net basis in its financial statements, other than the conversion and bond hedge derivatives which are presented net on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss), and all derivative balances presented are subject to provisions that are similar to master netting agreements. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, the company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedges and warrants in connection with its sale of   $150,000,000   in aggregate principal amount of the company s   5.00%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2021. The warrants, which increased paid in capital by   $12,376,000  , are clearly and closely related to the convertible notes and thus classified as equity. The note hedge assets and conversion liabilities were recorded, based on initial fair values, as an asset of   $27,975,000   and a liability of   $34,480,000  , respectively, and these fair values are updated quarterly with the offset to the income statement. See "Long-Term Debt" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for more detail. The fair values of the outstanding convertible note derivatives as of   September 30, 2016   and their effect on the Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) were as follows (in thousands): 

The convertible debt conversion liability and the note hedge asset amounts are included in Other Long-Term Obligations and Other Long-Term Assets, respectively, in the company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Fair Values 
    
  Pursuant to ASC 820, the inputs used to derive the fair value of assets and liabilities are analyzed and assigned a level I, II or III priority, with level I being the highest and level III being the lowest in the hierarchy. Level I inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level II inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets: quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. Level III inputs are based on valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable. The following table provides a summary of the company s assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis (in thousands): 

Forward Contracts:   The company operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. Specifically, the exposure includes intercompany loans and third party sales or payments. In an attempt to reduce this exposure, foreign currency forward contracts are utilized and accounted for as hedging instruments. The forward contracts are used to hedge the following currencies: AUD, CAD, CHF, CNY, DKK, EUR, GBP, MXP, NOK, NZD, SEK and USD. The company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Fair values for the company s foreign exchange forward contracts  
  
   FS-33 

     Table of Contents  
  INVACARE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) - September 30, 2016 

are based on quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities. The carrying values and fair values of the company s financial instruments are as follows (in thousands): 

________ 
  * The company's long-term debt is shown net of discount and fees associated with the Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 on the company's condensed consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, the fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 included in the long-term debt presented in this table is also shown net of the discount and fees. 
    
  The company, in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments, used the following methods and assumptions: 
  Cash, cash equivalents:   The carrying value reported in the balance sheet for cash, cash equivalents equals its fair value. 
  Other investments:   The company has made other investments in limited partnerships and non-marketable equity securities, which are accounted for using the cost method, adjusted for any estimated declines in value. These investments were acquired in private placements and there are no quoted market prices or stated rates of return. The company does not have the ability to easily sell these investments. The company completes an evaluation of the residual value related to these investments in the fourth quarter each year. 
  Installment receivables:   The carrying value reported in the balance sheet for installment receivables approximates its fair value. The interest rates associated with these receivables have not varied significantly since inception. Management believes that after consideration of the credit risk, the net book value of the installment receivables approximates market value. 
  Long-term debt:   Fair value for the company s convertible debt is based on quoted market-based estimates as of the end of the period, while the revolving credit facility fair value is based upon an estimate of the market for similar borrowing arrangements. The fair values are deemed to be categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  Convertible debt derivatives:   The fair values for the convertible debt conversion liability and note hedge derivatives are based on valuation models in which all the significant inputs are observable in active markets. 
  Forward contracts:   Fair values for the company s foreign exchange forward contracts are based on quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities. 
   
  Business Segments 
  The company operates in four primary business segments: North America/Home Medical Equipment (North America/HME), Institutional Products Group (IPG), Europe and Asia/Pacific. The North America/HME segment sells each of three primary product lines, which includes: lifestyle, mobility and seating and respiratory therapy products. IPG sells, and rented prior to the disposition of the rentals businesses, long-term care medical equipment, health care furnishings and accessory products. Europe and Asia/Pacific sell product lines similar to North America/HME and IPG. The accounting policies of each segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies for the company s consolidated financial statements. Intersegment sales and transfers are based on the costs to manufacture plus a reasonable profit element. 
    
  As of the third quarter of 2016, the company redefined the measure by which it evaluates segment profit or loss. Segment performance is measured and resources are allocated based on a number of factors, with the primary profit or loss measure being segment operating profit (loss). Segment operating profit (loss) represents net sales less cost of products sold less selling general and administrative expenses. Segment operating profit (loss) excludes unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses  
  
   FS-34 

     Table of Contents  
  INVACARE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) - September 30, 2016 

not allocated to the segments and intersegment sales and profit eliminations, which are included in All Other. In addition, segment operating profit (loss) further excludes charges related to restructuring activities, asset write-downs and gain or loss on sales of businesses (as applicable). The previous performance measure was earnings before income taxes. With the issuance of convertible debt during 2016, this performance measure has not been utilized by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) as the interest expense incurred by the company is related to the company s financing decision to issue convertible debt as compared to the operating decisions resulting from allocation of resources and segment operating income performance. In addition, earlier this year, the company included an operating income line on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) to emphasize the CODM s emphasis on operating income (loss). 
    
  As noted, this performance measure, segment operating income (loss), is used by the CODM for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to a segment and assessing its performance. In addition, this metric is reviewed by the company s Board of Directors regarding segment performance and is a key metric in the performance management assessment of the company's employees. The information by segment is as follows (in thousands):

Contingencies 
    
  General 
  In the ordinary course of its business, the company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits, primarily product liability actions in which various plaintiffs seek damages for injuries allegedly caused by defective products. All of the product liability lawsuits that the company faces in the United States have been referred to the company's captive insurance company and/or excess insurance carriers while all non-U.S. lawsuits have been referred to the company's commercial insurance carriers. All such lawsuits are generally contested vigorously. The coverage territory of the company's insurance is worldwide with the exception of those countries with respect to which, at the time the product is sold for use or at the time a claim is made, the U.S. government has suspended or prohibited diplomatic or trade relations. The amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures. 
    
  As a medical device manufacturer, the company is subject to extensive government regulation, including numerous laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse and laws regulating reimbursement under various government programs. The marketing, invoicing, documenting, developing, testing, manufacturing, labeling, promoting, distributing and other practices of health care suppliers and medical device manufacturers are all subject to government scrutiny. Most of the company's facilities are subject to inspection at any time by the FDA or similar medical device regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions. Violations of law or regulations can result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. 
    
  On   September 12, 2014  , an amended complaint, in a lawsuit originally instituted on   August 26, 2013  , was filed against Invacare Corporation, former officer and director Gerald B. Blouch, former officer and director A. Malachi Mixon III and the company's senior Vice President, Human Resources, Patricia Stumpp, as well as outside directors Dale C. LaPorte and Michael F. Delaney and former outside director Charles S. Robb, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties and violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in the administration and maintenance of the company stock fund in the company s Retirement Savings Plan (401(k) Plan). The lawsuit seeks class certification and unspecified damages and attorneys' fees for participants in the company's stock fund of the 401(k) Plan between   July 22, 2010   and the   present  . On   August 28, 2015  , the Court limited plaintiff s claim to the time period between   July 22, 2010   and   December 8, 2011  . This lawsuit has been referred to the company's insurance carriers. Following mediation, the parties entered into a written settlement agreement which was preliminarily approved by the Court on August 1, 2016, and which is subject to final court approval. The settlement amount is expected to be paid by the company's insurance carriers. 
    
  Medical Device Regulatory Matters 
    
  The FDA in the United States and comparable medical device regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions regulate virtually all aspects of the marketing, invoicing, documenting, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, distribution and other practices regarding medical devices. The company and its products are subject to the laws and regulations of the FDA and other regulatory bodies in the various jurisdictions where the company's products are manufactured or sold. The company's failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable medical device regulatory requirements can subject the company to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions or enforcement actions. These sanctions include injunctions, consent decrees, warning letters, civil penalties, criminal penalties, product seizure or detention, product recalls and total or partial suspension of production. 
  In December 2012, the company reached agreement with the FDA on the terms of a consent decree of injunction with respect to the company's Corporate facility and its Taylor Street wheelchair manufacturing facility in Elyria, Ohio.  A complaint and consent decree were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and on   December 21, 2012  , the Court approved the consent decree and it became effective. The consent decree limits the company's manufacture and distribution of power and manual wheelchairs, wheelchair components and wheelchair sub-assemblies at or from its Taylor Street manufacturing facility. The decree also initially limited design activities related to wheelchairs and power beds that take place at the impacted Elyria, Ohio facilities. The company is entitled to continue to produce from the Taylor Street manufacturing facility certain medically necessary wheelchairs provided that documentation and record-keeping requirements are followed, as well as ongoing replacement, service and repair of products already in use, under terms delineated in the consent decree. Under the terms of the consent decree, in order to resume full operations at the impacted facilities, the company must successfully complete third-party expert certification audits  
  
   FS-36 

     Table of Contents  
  INVACARE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) - September 30, 2016 

at the impacted Elyria facilities, which are comprised of three distinct reports that must be submitted to, and accepted by, the FDA. During 2013, the company completed the first two of the third-party expert certification audits, and the FDA found the results of both to be acceptable. In these reports, the third-party expert certified that the company's equipment and process validation procedures and its design control systems are compliant with the FDA's QSR. As a result of the FDA's acceptance of the first certification report on   May 13, 2013  , the Taylor Street facility was able to resume supplying parts and components for the further manufacturing of medical devices at other company facilities. The company's receipt of the FDA's acceptance of the second certification report on   July 15, 2013  , resulted in the company being able to resume design activities at the impacted facilities related to power wheelchairs and power beds.  In February, 2016, the independent expert auditor issued its certification report for the third phase of the consent decree indicating substantial compliance with the FDA's QSR and the report was submitted to the FDA.   Similar to the first and second certification processes, the FDA has responded to this report with clarifying questions to which the company and the independent expert have responded. 
  In December 2015, the FDA issued Form 483 observations following a 2015 inspection of approximately 5 months at the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities in Elyria, Ohio which included a review of the company s compliance with the terms of the consent decree and the matters covered by the first and second expert certification reports previously accepted in 2013 (the  December 2015 Form 483 ).  The company has filed its responses to this Form 483 and continues to work on addressing the FDA s observations. 
  On June 7, 2016, the company received a letter from the FDA in follow up to the December 2015 Form 483 and the company s subsequent responses. To satisfy FDA s design control requirements, the FDA letter outlined additional steps the company must take.  In particular, the FDA clarified its requirement for the company to complete the remediation of certain design history files (DHFs) referenced in the December 2015 Form 483 and in the consent decree. Before the company can design any new Taylor Street wheelchair devices, the specified DHFs must be completed, then recertified by the company s third-party expert, whose updated report must be accepted by the FDA. The FDA also clarified that its acceptance of the expert s updated report on these DHFs is a prerequisite to proceeding further with the third certification process.  
   Under the terms of the consent decree, the company must submit its own written report to the FDA regarding its compliance status together with its written responses to any observations in the independent expert's certification report. Both the independent expert's third certification report, submitted in February 2016, as well as the company's own report must be accepted by the FDA before the agency reinspects the impacted Elyria facilities. If the FDA is satisfied with the company's compliance, the FDA will provide written notification that the company is permitted to resume full operations at the impacted facilities. The company cannot predict the acceptance of these reports by the FDA, the timing of the inspection, nor any remaining work that may be needed to meet the FDA's requirements to resume full operations at the impacted facilities. The FDA has the authority to inspect any FDA registered facility at any time.  
  After resumption of full operations, the company must undergo five years of audits by a third-party expert auditor to determine whether the facilities are in continuous compliance with FDA's QSR and the consent decree. The auditor will inspect the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities  activities every six months during the first year following the resumption of full operations and then every 12 months for the next four years thereafter. 
  As described above, because the limitations on production are not expected to be permanent in nature, and partial production is allowed, the company does not anticipate any major repair, replacement or scrapping of its fixed assets at the Taylor Street manufacturing facility. Based on the company's expectations at the time of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with respect to the utilization of such raw material and with respect to expected future cash flows from production at the Taylor Street manufacturing facility, the company concluded that there is no impairment in the value of the fixed assets related to the Taylor Street manufacturing facility at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The majority of the production from the Taylor Street facility is "made to order" custom wheelchairs for customers and, as a result, there was not a significant amount of finished goods inventory on hand at   September 30, 2016  , and the inventory is expected to be fully utilized. Accordingly, the company concluded that there was not an impairment of the work in process and finished goods at the Taylor Street facility at   September 30, 2016  . Further, based on its analysis of the raw material inventory at the Taylor Street facility and the company's expectations at the time of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with respect to the time frame for FDA's acceptance of the third-party expert certification audit and FDA inspection, the company concluded that the value of the inventory was not excessive nor impaired at   September 30, 2016  . However, if the company's expectations regarding the impacts of the limitations in the consent decree or the time frame for acceptance of the third-party expert certification  
  
   FS-37 

     Table of Contents  
  INVACARE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) - September 30, 2016 

audit and FDA inspection were to change, the company may, in future periods, conclude that an impairment exists with respect to its fixed assets or inventory at the Taylor Street facility. 
  Although the North America/HME segment is the segment primarily impacted by the limitations in the FDA consent decree, the Asia/Pacific segment also is negatively affected as a result of the consent decree due to the lower sales volume of microprocessor controllers. During 2012, before the effective date of the consent decree, the company started to experience decreases in net sales in the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific segments. The company believes that those decreases, which continued beyond 2012, were driven in large part by the consent decree which led to delays in new product introductions and to uncertainty regarding the timing of exiting the consent decree, which limited the company's ability to renegotiate and bid on certain customer contracts and otherwise led to a decline in customer orders. The negative effect of the consent decree on customer orders and net sales in these segments has been considerable, and the company expects to continue to experience low levels of net sales in the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific segments at least until it has successfully completed the previously-described FDA re-inspection and has received written notification from the FDA that the company may resume full operations at the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities. Even after the company is permitted to resume full operations at the affected facilities, it is uncertain as to whether, or how quickly, the company will be able to rebuild net sales to more typical historical levels, irrespective of market conditions. Accordingly, when compared to the company's 2010 results, the limitations in the consent decree had, and likely will continue to have, a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Separately, net sales in the North America/HME segment have likely been impacted by uncertainty on the part of the company's customers as they coped with prepayment reviews and post-payment audits by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") and contemplated their participation in the National Competitive Bidding ("NCB") process. In addition, net sales in the North America/HME segment have and may continue to decline as a result of the company's strategic focus away from lower margin, less differentiated products as the company becomes more focused on its clinically complex products.

  The company's warranty reserves are subject to adjustment in future periods based on historical analysis of warranty claims and as new developments occur that may change the company's estimates related to specific product recalls. See Current Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the total provision amounts and a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual. 
    
  In December 2010, the company received a warning letter from the FDA related to quality system processes and procedures at the company's Sanford, Florida facility. In January 2014, the FDA conducted inspections at the company s manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China and at the company s electronic components subsidiary in Christchurch, New Zealand, covering quality systems and current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. In August 2014, the FDA inspected Alber GmbH in Albstadt, Germany. The FDA issued its inspectional observations on Forms 483 to the company after these inspections, and the company submitted its responses to the agency in a timely manner. In October 2014, the FDA conducted an inspection at the Sanford facility and, at the conclusion, issued its Form 483 observations. In December 2015, the FDA issued Form 483 observations following a 2015 inspection of approximately 5 months at the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities in Elyria, Ohio. In July 2016, the FDA inspected Motion Concepts L.P. in Concord, Ontario, Canada and issued its inspectional observations on Form 483. The company has timely filed its responses to these Forms 483 with the FDA and continues to work on addressing the FDA's observations. The results of regulatory claims, proceedings, investigations, or litigation are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution or outcome of the FDA warning letter or other FDA enforcement related to the Sanford or other company facilities could materially and adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.  
  Any of the above contingencies could have an adverse impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations.

Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Continuing Operations. 

OUTLOOK 
    
  The company continued to execute its transformation from being a generalist durable home medical equipment company to one more focused on solutions for clinically complex and post-acute care. The company offers a robust portfolio of clinically complex products through its core business and subsidiaries, including complex rehabilitation technology, therapeutic support surfaces and wound prevention, safe patient handling, respiratory therapy technology, and bariatric products. 
    
  The first phase of the transformation, which began late in 2015, included building the North America/HME complex rehabilitation sales force. This rehabilitation sales force and commercial processes are being enhanced to provide clinical solutions to select customer call points and to understand the benefits of the company s mobility and seating product portfolio, which comprises a majority of the company s clinically complex portfolio, as well as related products from its subsidiaries. Over time the company expects the net sales weakness from its Taylor Street power wheelchair manufacturing facility, as a result of the consent decree, to be offset by the integration and expanded product sales from its other complex rehab facilities. This phase of transformation will include periods of net sales declines, investments in selling, general and administrative (SG A) expense, and negative cash flow.  The company is actively managing to improve sales mix as reflected in gross margin as a percentage of net sales. In the third quarter of 2016, the company's gross margin percentage was flat compared to third quarter last year with the improvement in North America/HME gross margin percentage offset, in part, by additional investments in research and development (R D). 
    
  Progress continued in the third quarter consistent with the first phase of the company's transformation plan. The company made good progress strengthening its North America salesforce with the addition of new members and clinical training for its complex rehabilitation team. The early stages of recruiting and training for the company's post-acute care team is progressing well after starting in the second quarter of 2016. In the third quarter, the company saw positive results of mix shift in the complex rehabilitation products and the focus away from less strategic product groups, including the sale of our Garden City Medical business and decrease in sales of other less accretive product lines. Also in support of the transformation, the company launched two significant new products in the third quarter: the LiNX        control system,  the industry s first wirelessly programmable complex power wheelchair control system, which leads the industry s next generation of complex control systems with substantial benefits for chair operators, clinicians and the company's customers; and the Alber Twion        power assist system for active manual wheelchair users, which has a novel smartphone interface and leading features for simple daily use. 
    
  Transformation of the IPG segment, which is principally the post-acute care part of our business, began in the second quarter 2016. Post-acute care can be provided in a variety of clinical settings outside of hospitals. Over the past quarter, the company began developing a specialized post-acute care sales force, with investments in clinical sales training, assessment of customer call points, and recruitment. 
    
  To support the transformation, the company continued with investments in SG A expense during the third quarter of 2016, and expects to continue this spending throughout this year and into 2017, to deepen clinical expertise and increase commercial effectiveness. The investments, notably the hiring of sales representatives to support the new strategy, as well as increasing the quantity of demonstration units at clinical call points, are expected to take several quarters to be accretive. Over time, as the turnaround continues to produce results, the company expects these investments to yield greater consolidated gross margin as a percentage of net sales and greater gross profit dollars. 
    
  As a result of the business transformation, which includes a focus on sales growth in lines of business with longer working capital cycles, the company expects expanded working capital balances and a resulting interim negative impact on cash flow as that expansion occurs. The company may also explore streamlining its operations and better aligning its infrastructure to efficiently deliver an improved mix of clinically complex products. To finance this transformation, grow related working capital, fund ongoing quality initiatives, and to support the company through historic seasonal performance cycles and continued foreign currency pressure, the company completed the issuance in the first quarter of 2016 of $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.00% convertible senior notes, which mature in 2021. 
    
  The strategic shift from lower margin, less differentiated products along with external market dynamics, resulted in lower consolidated net sales and constant currency net sales for the third quarter of 2016. The company balanced margin shift resulting from the mix of declining and increasing businesses to keep gross margin percentage flat. The company continued to make measured

SG A investments as part of its transformation, and the company had positive free cash flow for the quarter. The company ended the quarter with a cash balance of   $138.4 million  . 
    
  Between this shift and the ongoing pressure on lifestyle and respiratory products from National Competitive Bidding (NCB) in the United States, the company expects consolidated net sales to decline through the remainder of the year. However, the company's short-term metric for assessing the success of its transformation to becoming more clinically oriented and having better long-term financial results is a gross margin improvement with an initial improvement in gross margin as a percentage of net sales, and later with an increase in gross profit dollars. Despite the focus on clinically complex products, the company's gross margin was flat for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as a percentage of net sales, as the improvement in the North America/HME gross margin percentage was offset, in part, by additional investments in research and development. 
    
  In October, the company named a new leader for its European business, Ralf Ledda, who has been with the company for 21 years as leader of the company's Alber Gmbh business in Germany. Also in October, the company resized certain parts of the North America business in line with shifts in staffing needs. This action is expected to generate annual cost savings of approximately $2.6 million. 
    
  For the nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net sales, excluding foreign currency translation, increased in the Europe and Asia/Pacific segments but declined in the North America/HME and IPG segments. In addition, the European and Institutional Products Group segments contributed positive operating income while the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific recognized operating losses for the nine month ended   September 30, 2016  , resulting in a net loss from continuing operations of   $0.78   per share compared to a net loss of   $0.73   per share for each period, respectively. 
    
  The company expects to take advantage of opportunities for growth across its many product lines and businesses by providing clinical solutions to the growing demographic in need of the company s products. The company also remains focused on building an enterprise-wide quality culture, which it believes will ultimately be a competitive advantage. The company will move forward with its transformation, managing through external uncertainty, including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in payor reimbursement policies. The company is demonstrating some improvements in the key short-term metrics as a result of its strategic shift. However, in spite of this, there may be interim periods where the company s investments do not fully yield expected financial improvements, particularly in light of various external factors.

RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS 
    
  Except for free cash flow, the financial information for all periods excludes the results of three businesses which were sold and classified as discontinued operations.  On July 2, 2015, the company divested its United States medical device rentals businesses for long-term care facilities (rentals businesses), which were a part of the IPG segment. On September 30, 2016, the company completed the sale of its subsidiary, Garden City Medical Inc. ("GCM"), to Compass Health Brands for   $13,829,000   in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. GCM, doing business as PMI and Pinnacle Medsource, sourced and distributed primarily single-use products under the brand ProBasics        by PMI. GCM was part of the North America/Home Medical Equipment (HME) segment. This divestiture further refines the company s focus on other lines of business where the company s resources can best generate returns in areas of complex rehabilitation and post-acute care. Both CGM and the rentals businesses were not deemed discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes, and therefore are included in the results below unless otherwise noted. For more information, see the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  With the implementation of ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , the company re-assessed the classification of amortization of debt fees. Historically, these costs were reflected in Selling, General and Administrative (SG A) expenses, however, the company has determined it is more appropriate to classify the costs as interest expense. The amounts now classified as interest expense versus SG A are $526,000 and   $1,435,000   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively; and $137,000 and   $997,000   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

The increases in interest expense for the   third   quarter and year to date as compared to the same periods a year ago was primarily due to the convertible notes issuance in the first quarter of 2016 and to capital lease interest as a result of the real estate sale and leaseback transaction finalized in the second quarter of 2015. Interest expense for the first nine months of 2015 included   $668,000   for the write-off of bank fees. With the implementation of ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , the company re-assessed the classification of amortization of debt fees. Historically, these costs were reflected in SG A expenses; however, the company determined it was more appropriate to classify the costs as interest expense. See the "Reclassifications" disclosure in the Accounting Policies note to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for more detail. Interest income was   $79,000   and   $207,000     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $42,000   and   $122,000  , for the same respective periods last year.  
    
  Income Taxes.   The company had an effective tax rate of   743.7%   and   48.2%   on losses before tax from continuing operations   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to an expected benefit at the U.S. statutory rate

of   35.0%   on the continuing operations pre-tax losses for each period. The company's effective tax rate   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was unfavorable as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate expected benefit, principally due to the negative impact of the company not being able to record tax benefits related to the significant losses in countries which had tax valuation allowances. The effective tax rate was reduced by certain taxes outside the United States, excluding countries with tax valuation allowances, that were at an effective rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Installment payments were made in the first half of 2016 related to a previously disclosed liability for uncertain tax positions and current taxes payable, and during the second quarter of 2016, the company accelerated and paid the balance of the installment obligation, in order to reduce interest costs. 
    
  The company had an effective tax rate of   886.1%   and   90.9%   on losses before tax from continuing operations   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, compared to an expected benefit at the U.S. statutory rate of   35.0%   on the continuing operations pre-tax losses for each period. The company's effective tax rate   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was unfavorable as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate expected benefit, principally due to the negative impact of the company not being able to record tax benefits related to the significant losses in countries which had tax valuation allowances. The effective tax rate was reduced by certain taxes outside the United States, excluding countries with tax valuation allowances, that were at an effective rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  The company continues to maintain an adequate liquidity position through its unused bank lines of credit (see Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report) and working capital management. 
    
  The company's total debt outstanding, inclusive of the debt discount related to the convertible senior subordinated debentures due 2027 included in equity in accordance with FSB APB 14-1 as well as the debt discount and fees associated with the convertible senior notes due 2021,   increase  d by   $148,865,000   to   $197,188,000   at   September 30, 2016   from   $48,323,000   as of   December 31, 2015  . The company's balance sheet reflects the impact of ASC 470-20, which reduced debt and increased equity by   $544,000   and   $1,203,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, related to the convertible senior subordinated debentures due 2027. The debt discount and fees associated with the convertible senior notes due 2021 reduced the company's reported debt balance by   $31,330,000   and   $5,220,000  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  . The debt increase during the first   nine   months of   2016   was principally a result of issuing   $150,000,000   aggregate principal amount of   5.00%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2021. The company's cash and cash equivalents were   $138,427,000   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $60,055,000   as of   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the company had   zero   borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility. Cash balances increased in the third quarter of 2016 compared to second quarter of 2016 primarily due to the sale of its subsidiary,   GCM   for   $13,829,000  . The increase in cash balances compared to December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of the net proceeds received from the issuance of convertible debt in the first quarter of 2016 and the sale proceeds from the sale of   GCM   partially offset by cash flow usage. 
    
  The company's cash balances were utilized for normal operations during the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  . Debt repayments, acquisitions, divestitures, the timing of vendor payments, the granting of extended payment terms to significant national accounts and other activity can have a significant impact on the company's cash flow and borrowings outstanding such that the debt reported at the end of a given period may be materially different than debt levels during a given period. While the company has cash balances in various jurisdictions around the world, there are no material restrictions regarding the use of such cash for dividends within the company, loans or other purposes, except in China where the cash balance as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $6,495,000  . 
    
  The company has an asset-based lending Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ), which provides for a revolving line of credit, letter of credit and swing line facility for the company's U.S. and Canadian borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100,000,000 (the "U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility") and a similar facility for European borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of up to $30,000,000 (the "European Credit Facility") each of which is subject to variable rates and availability based on a borrowing base formula. The initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay approximately $17,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of borrowings and terminate the company's previous credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature in October 2015. As determined pursuant to the borrowing base formula for the U.S. and Canadian borrowers, the company s borrowing base including the period ending   September 30, 2016   under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was approximately   $60,078,000  , with aggregate borrowing availability of approximately   $38,687,000  , taking into account the   $5,000,000   minimum availability reserve, then-outstanding letters of credit, other reserves and the   $11,250,000   dominion trigger amount noted below  .   As determined pursuant to the borrowing base formula  
  
   I-7 

     Table of Contents  

for the European borrowers, the company s borrowing base including the period ending   September 30, 2016   under the European Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was approximately   $22,631,000  , with aggregate borrowing availability of approximately   $16,256,000  , taking into account the   $3,000,000   minimum availability reserve and the   $3,375,000   dominion trigger amount noted below  .   See Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding the Credit Agreement. 
    
  As a result of entering into the Credit Agreement, the company incurred   $1,954,000   in fees, which were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense through January 2018. In addition, as a result of terminating the previous credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature in October 2015, the company wrote off   $668,000   in previously capitalized fees in the first quarter of 2015, which is reflected in interest expense for the North America / HME segment.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the company was in compliance with all covenant requirements under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants including dominion triggers requiring the company to maintain borrowing capacity of not less than   $11,250,000   on an given business day or $12,500,000 for five consecutive days related to the U.S. and Canadian borrowers and   $3,375,000   on an given business day or   12.5%   of the maximum amount that may be drawn under the European Credit Facility for five consecutive days related to European borrowers in order to avoid triggering full control by an agent for the lenders of the company's cash receipts for application to the company's obligations under the agreement.  
    
  If the company is unable to comply with the provisions in the Credit Agreement, it could result in a default, which could trigger acceleration of, or the right to accelerate, the related debt. Because of cross-default provisions in its agreements and instruments governing certain of the company's indebtedness, a default under the Credit Agreement could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, certain other company indebtedness. In addition, the company's lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness. 
    
  Based on the company's current expectations, the company believes that its cash balances, available borrowing capacity under its Credit Agreement and any cash generated by operations should be sufficient to meet working capital needs, capital requirements, and commitments for at least the next twelve months. Notwithstanding the company's expectations, if the company's operating results decline as the result of pressures on the business due to, for example, currency fluctuations or regulatory issues or the company's failure to execute its business plans, the company may be unable to comply with its obligations under the Credit Agreement, and its lenders could demand repayment of the amounts outstanding under the company's credit facilities. 
    
  In the first quarter of 2016, the company issued   $150,000,000   aggregate principal amount of   5.00%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 in a private offering. The notes bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per year payable semi-annually and will mature in February 2021, unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to August 15, 2020, the notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Unless and until the company obtains shareholder approval under applicable New York Stock Exchange rules, the notes will be convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash. If the company obtains such shareholder approval, the notes may be settled in cash, the company s common shares or a combination of cash and the company s common shares, at the company s election. 
    
  In connection with the offering of the notes, the company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with two financial institutions (the  option counterparties ). These transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of the company s common shares that will initially underlie the notes, and are expected generally to reduce the potential equity dilution, and/or offset any cash payments in excess of the principal amount due, as the case may be, upon conversion of the notes. The company entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the option counterparties at a higher strike price relating to the same number of the company s common shares, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, pursuant to which the company sold warrants to the option counterparties. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on the company s outstanding common shares and the company s earnings per share to the extent that the price of the company s common shares exceeds the strike price of those warrants. 
    
  The initial net proceeds from the offering were   $144,034,000  , after deducting fees and estimated offering expenses payable by the company. Approximately   $5,000,000   of the net proceeds from the offering was used to repurchase the company s common shares, and   $15,600,000   of the net proceeds was used to pay the net cost of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. The company incurred   $5,966,000   in fees, which were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense through February 2021, of which all   $5,966,000   was paid by   September 30, 2016  . The company intends to use the remaining net proceeds from the  
  
   I-8 

     Table of Contents  

offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include funding portions of the company s ongoing turnaround and addressing potential risks and contingencies. The net proceeds will allow the company to invest in new products, people, marketing initiatives and working capital to transform the business and pursue growth. 
    
  The company also has an agreement with De Lage Landen, Inc. ( DLL ), a third party financing company, to provide the majority of future lease financing to the company's North America customers. Either party could terminate this agreement with 180 days' notice or 90 days' notice by DLL upon the occurrence of certain events. Should this agreement be terminated, the company's borrowing needs under the Credit Agreement could increase. 
    
  While there is general concern about the potential for rising interest rates, the company expects that it will be able to absorb modest rate increases in the months ahead without any material impact on its liquidity or capital resources. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average floating interest rate on revolving credit borrowings, excluding capital leases, was   4.93%   compared to   3.83%   as of   December 31, 2015  . 

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 
    
  The company estimates that capital investments for   2016   could approximate between   $11,000,000   and   $13,000,000  , compared to actual capital expenditures of   $7,522,000   in   2015  . The anticipated increase considers the company's investments to transform the company. The company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and existing borrowing facilities, will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements and fund required capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. The Credit Agreement, as amended in February 2016, limits the company's annual capital expenditures to   $35,000,000  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the company has material capital expenditure commitments outstanding, consisting primarily of computer systems contracts. See Item 7. Contractual Obligations of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

CASH FLOWS 
    
  Cash flows used by operating activities were   $49,385,000   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to cash flows used of   $35,549,000   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease in operating cash flow in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of last year was principally due to a higher net loss, the negative cash flow impact of higher inventories and tax payments of approximately   $12,500,000   related to a previously disclosed liability for uncertain tax positions and current taxes. Operating cash flows for the first   nine   months of 2015 were negatively impacted by retirement payments of   $24,651,000   related to the retirement of two executive officers of the company. 
    
  Cash flows provided by investing activities were   $6,967,000   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to cash flows provided of   $44,353,000   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . Cash flows provided by investing activities for the first   nine   months of 2016 included net proceeds of   $13,829,000   from the sale of   GCM  . Cash flows provided by investing activities for the first   nine   months of 2015 included the receipt of   $23,000,000   in proceeds from the company's real estate sale leaseback transaction as well as the surrender of corporate-owned life insurance totaling   $11,900,000   used to fund benefit payments related to the retirement of executive officers. In addition, the company received net proceeds of   $13,700,000   from the sale of its rental businesses in July 2015. 
    
  Cash flows provided by financing activities were   $119,362,000   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to cash flows used of   $11,955,000   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . Cash flows provided in the first   nine   months of   2016   reflect net proceeds received as a result of the issuance of Convertible Senior Notes due 2021, including the net proceeds used for the related convertible note hedge transactions, repurchase of common shares and payment of financing costs.   
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , free cash flow was negative   $56,153,000   compared to negative   $18,352,000   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The first   nine   months   2016   and 2015 free cash flow was negatively impacted by the same items that affected cash flows used by operation activities. In addition, free cash flow for the first   nine   months of 2015 included a positive free cash flow impact of   $23,000,000   as a result of the proceeds from the company's real estate sale leaseback transaction. Excluding the negative impact of the   $12,500,000   tax payment noted above, free cash flow in the first   nine   months of 2016 was negative   $43,653,000  . Excluding the   $23,000,000   positive impact of the real estate sale and leaseback transaction and the   $24,651,000   negative impact of the retirement payments noted above, free cash flow in the first nine months of 2015 was negative   $16,701,000  . Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that is comprised of net cash used by operating activities less purchases of property

and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Management believes that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating the overall financial performance of the company and its ability to repay debt or make future investments (including acquisitions, etc.). 
    
  The non-GAAP financial measure is reconciled to the GAAP measure as follows (in thousands): 

BUSINESS SEGMENT NET SALES 
    
  Business Segment Net Sales   -   The following tables provide net sales change for continuing operations as reported and as adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign exchange translation (constant currency net sales) as well as net sales further adjusted to exclude the impact of the sale of the rentals businesses, which were sold in July 2015 and not deemed a discontinued operation from an external reporting perspective.  Constant currency net sales" is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The current year's functional current currency net sales are translated using the prior year's foreign exchange rates. These amounts are then compared to the prior year's sales to calculate the constant currency net sales change. Management believes that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating the core operating performance of the company.

At the current rate, the cash dividend will amount to $0.05 per Common Share on an annual basis, subject to Board of Directors approval of future dividend payments. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
    
  The Consolidated Financial Statements included in the report include accounts of the company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes. In preparing the financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. 
    
  The following critical accounting policies, among others, affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
  Invacare s revenues are recognized when products are shipped or services provided to unaffiliated customers.   Revenue Recognition  , ASC 605, provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues. The company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with GAAP and ASC 605. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. 
    
  Sales are made only to customers with whom the company believes collection is reasonably assured based upon a credit analysis, which may include obtaining a credit application, a signed security agreement, personal guarantee and/or a cross corporate guarantee depending on the credit history of the customer. Credit lines are established for new customers after an evaluation of their credit report and/or other relevant financial information. Existing credit lines are regularly reviewed and adjusted with consideration given to any outstanding past due amounts. 

I-11 

     Table of Contents  

The company offers discounts and rebates, which are accounted for as reductions to revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized. Discounts offered include: cash discounts for prompt payment, base and trade discounts based on contract level for specific classes of customers. Volume discounts and rebates are given based on large purchases and the achievement of certain sales volumes. Product returns are accounted for as a reduction to reported sales with estimates recorded for anticipated returns at the time of sale. The company does not ship any goods on consignment. 
    
  Distributed products sold by the company are accounted for in accordance with the revenue recognition guidance in ASC 605-45-05  .   The company records distributed product sales gross as a principal since the company takes title to the products and has the risks of loss for collections, delivery and returns. 
    
  Product sales that give rise to installment receivables are recorded at the time of sale when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Interest income is recognized on installment agreements in accordance with the terms of the agreements. Installment accounts are monitored and if a customer defaults on payments, interest income is no longer recognized. All installment accounts are accounted for using the same methodology, regardless of duration of the installment agreements. 
    
  Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable 
  The estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on management's evaluation of the financial condition of the customer. In addition, as a result of the third party financing arrangement, management monitors the collection status of these contracts in accordance with the company's limited recourse obligations and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts and establishing reserves for specific customers as needed.  
  The company continues to closely monitor the credit-worthiness of its customers and adhere to tight credit policies. In 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced new Medicare prices which became effective in July 2013 for the second round of the NCB program, which was expanded to include 91 additional MSAs. The reimbursement reductions to the rural areas began in January 2016 and continued in July 2016. Further reductions may occur if private payors elect to adopt their own reimbursement changes. The company believes the changes could have a significant impact on the collectability of accounts receivable for those customers which are in the rural locations impacted and which have a portion of their revenues tied to Medicare reimbursement. As a result, this is an additional risk factor which the company considers when assessing the collectability of accounts receivable.  
    
  The company has an agreement with DLL, a third party financing company, to provide the majority of future lease financing to Invacare's North America customers. The DLL agreement provides for direct leasing between DLL and the Invacare customer. The company retains a recourse obligation for events of default under the contracts. The company monitors the collections status of these contracts and has provided amounts for estimated losses in its allowances for doubtful accounts. 
    
  Inventories and Related Allowance for Obsolete and Excess Inventory 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the first-in, first-out method. Inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. A provision for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded as needed based upon the discontinuation of products, redesigning of existing products, new product introductions, market changes and safety issues. Both raw materials and finished goods are reserved for on the balance sheet. 
    
  In general, Invacare reviews inventory turns as an indicator of obsolescence or slow moving product as well as the impact of new product introductions and product line discontinuations. Depending on the situation, the company may partially or fully reserve for the individual item. The company continues to increase its overseas sourcing efforts, increase its emphasis on the development and introduction of new products, and decrease the cycle time to bring new product offerings to market. These initiatives are potential sources of inventory obsolescence for both raw material and finished goods. 
    
  Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets 
  Property, equipment, intangibles and certain other long-lived assets are amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management's estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue. Under   Intangibles-Goodwill and Other  , ASC 350, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests. The company's measurement date for its annual goodwill impairment test is October 1 and the analysis is completed in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, goodwill and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  
  
   I-12 

     Table of Contents  

indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The majority of the company's goodwill and intangible assets relate to the company's Europe and IPG segments which are profitable. 
    
  To review goodwill for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, the company first estimates the fair value of each reporting unit and compares the calculated fair value to the carrying value of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below. The company has determined that its reporting units are the same as its operating segments. The company completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. To estimate the fair values of the reporting units, the company utilizes a discounted cash flow (DCF) method in which the company forecasts income statement and balance sheet amounts based on assumptions regarding future sales growth, profitability, inventory turns, days' sales outstanding, etc. to forecast future cash flows. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital discount rate where the cost of debt is based on quoted rates for 20-year debt of companies of similar credit risk and the cost of equity is based upon the 20-year treasury rate for the risk free rate, a market risk premium, the industry average beta and a small cap stock adjustment. The discount rates used have a significant impact upon the discounted cash flow methodology utilized in the company's annual impairment testing as higher discount rates decrease the fair value estimates. The assumptions used are based on a market participant's point of view and yielded a discount rate of   9.41%   in 2015 for the company's annual impairment analysis compared to   9.89%   in 2014 and   10.00%   in 2013. 
  The company also utilizes an Enterprise Value (EV) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) Method to compute the fair value of its reporting units which considers potential acquirers and their EV to EBITDA multiples adjusted by an estimated premium. While more weight is given to the discounted cash flow method, the EV to EBITDA method does provide corroborative evidence of the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow method results. 
  In 2015, the company performed a review for potential impairments of any other assets, including the company's Taylor Street facility which is subject to the FDA consent decree that limits the company's manufacture and distribution of custom power and manual wheelchairs, wheelchair components and wheelchair subassemblies at the Taylor Street facility. The company determined there was no impairment of the property, plant and equipment of the Taylor Street facility based on a comparison of the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the net assets in accordance with ASC 360. In addition, the company determined there was no impairment of inventory associated with the facility. There were no changes during the first   nine   months of 2016 which would result in an impairment of inventory or other assets at the Taylor Street facility. 
  While there was no indication of impairment in 2015 related to goodwill for the Europe or IPG segments, a future potential impairment is possible for any of the company's segments should actual results differ materially from forecasted results used in the valuation analysis. Furthermore, the company's annual valuation of goodwill can differ materially if the market inputs used to determine the discount rate change significantly. For instance, higher interest rates or greater stock price volatility would increase the discount rate and thus increase the chance of impairment. In consideration of this potential, the company reviewed the results if the discount rate used were 100 basis points higher for the 2015 impairment analysis and determined that there still would not be any indicator of potential impairment for the segments with goodwill which are Europe and IPG. 
  The company's intangible assets consist of intangible assets with defined lives as well as intangible assets with indefinite lives. Defined-lived intangible assets consist principally of customer lists, developed technology, license agreements, patents and other miscellaneous intangibles such as non-compete agreements.  The company's indefinite lived intangible assets consist entirely of trademarks. 
  The company evaluates the carrying value of definite-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Definite-lived assets are determined to be impaired if the future un-discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value. Actual impairment amounts for definite-lived assets are then calculated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The company reviews indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Any impairment amounts for indefinite-lived assets are calculated as the difference between the future discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset less than the carrying value for the asset.   
  Product Liability 
  The company is self-insured in North America for product liability exposures through its captive insurance company, Invatection Insurance company, which currently has a policy year that runs from September 1 to August 31 and insures annual policy losses up to   $10,000,000   per occurrence and   $13,000,000   in the aggregate. The company also has additional layers of external insurance coverage, related to all lines of insurance coverage, insuring up to   $75,000,000   in aggregate losses per policy

     Table of Contents  

year arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the company s per country foreign liability limits, as applicable. There can be no assurance that the company s current insurance levels will continue to be adequate or available at affordable rates. 
    
  Product liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience, industry expertise and other indicators. Additional reserves, in excess of the specific individual case reserves, are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted. Historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the company in estimating the ultimate reserves. For example, the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience, that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate. Estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and settlements on claims. While actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves, the company is responsible for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices. 
    
  Warranty 
  Generally, the company s products are covered by warranties against defects in material and workmanship for various periods depending on the product from the date of sale to the customer. Certain components carry a lifetime warranty. A provision for estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time of sale based upon actual experience. The company continuously assesses the adequacy of its product warranty accrual and makes adjustments as needed. Historical analysis is primarily used to determine the company s warranty reserves. Claims history is reviewed and provisions are adjusted as needed. However, the company does consider other events, such as a product recall, which could warrant additional warranty reserve provision. See Current Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual. 
    
  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
  The company accounts for share based compensation under the provisions of   Compensation Stock Compensation  , ASC 718  .   The company has not made any modifications to the terms of any previously granted awards and no changes have been made regarding the valuation methodologies or assumptions used to determine the fair value of awards granted. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $13,343,000   of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock-based compensation arrangements, which is related to non-vested options and shares, and includes   $9,618,000   related to restricted stock awards,   $255,000   related to non-qualified stock options and   $3,470,000   related to performance share awards. 
    
  The substantial majority of the options awarded have been granted at exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock awards granted without cost to the recipients are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods. Performance awards granted are expensed based on estimated achievement of the performance objectives over the relevant performance award periods. 
    
  Income Taxes 
  As part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the company is required to estimate income taxes in various jurisdictions. The process requires estimating the company s current tax liability, including assessing uncertainties related to tax return filing positions, as well as estimating temporary differences due to the different treatment of items for tax and accounting policies. The temporary differences are reported as deferred tax assets and or liabilities. The company also must estimate whether it will more likely than not realize its deferred tax assets and whether a valuation allowance should be established  .   Substantially all of the company s U.S., Australia and New Zealand     deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from its estimates, the company s provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. The company does not believe that there is a substantial likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to its critical accounting policies. 
    
  Accounting for Convertible Debt and Related Derivatives 
  In the first quarter of 2016, the company issued   $150,000,000   aggregate principal amount of   5.00%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the  notes ). In connection with the offering of the notes, the company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with two financial institutions (the  option counterparties ). These transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of the company s common shares that will initially underlie the notes, and are expected  
  
   I-14 

     Table of Contents  

generally to reduce the potential equity dilution, and/or offset any cash payments in excess of the principal amount due, as the case may be, upon conversion of the notes. The company entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the option counterparties at a higher strike price relating to the same number of the company s common shares, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, pursuant to which the company sold warrants to the option counterparties. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on the company s outstanding common shares and the company s earnings per share to the extent that the price of the company s common shares exceeds the strike price of those warrants. The strike price of the warrants will initially be $22.4175 per share and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the warrant transactions. 
    
  The convertible debt conversion liability and the convertible note hedges are accounted for as derivatives that are fair valued quarterly while the warrants are included as equity. The fair value of the convertible debt conversion liability and the convertible note hedges are estimated using a lattice model incorporating the terms and conditions of the notes and considering, for example, changes in the prices of the company's common stock, company stock price volatility, risk-free rates and changes in market rates. The valuations are, among other things, subject to changes in both the company's credit worthiness and the counter-parties to the instruments as well as change in general market conditions. While the change in fair value of the convertible debt conversion liability and the convertible note hedges are generally expected to move in opposite directions, the net change in any given period may be material. 
    
  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  For the company s disclosure regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  The company is exposed to market risk through various financial instruments, including fixed rate and floating rate debt instruments. The company has at times used interest swap agreements to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. As of   September 30, 2016  , a 1% change in interest rates would have no impact on annual interest expense as the company did not have any variable rate debt outstanding. Additionally, the company operates internationally and, as a result, is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. Specifically, the exposure results from intercompany loans, intercompany sales or payments and third party sales or payments. In an attempt to reduce this exposure, foreign currency forward contracts are utilized to hedge intercompany purchases and sales as well as third party purchases and sales. The company does not believe that any potential loss related to these financial instruments would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  The company is party to the Credit Agreement which was originally entered into on   January 16, 2015   and matures in   January 2018  . Accordingly, while the company is exposed to increases in interest rates, its exposure to the volatility of the current market environment is limited as the company recently entered into its Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary default provisions, with certain grace periods and exceptions, which provide that events of default that include, among other things, failure to pay amounts due, breach of covenants, representations or warranties, bankruptcy, the occurrence of a material adverse effect, exclusion from any medical reimbursement program, and an interruption of any material manufacturing facilities for more than ten consecutive days. Should the company fail to comply with these requirements, the company would potentially have to attempt to obtain alternative financing and in those circumstances likely would be required to pay much higher interest rates. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the company had   no   borrowings outstanding under its Credit Agreement, which provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility for U.S. and Canadian borrowers of up to $100,000,000 at variable rates, subject to availability based on a borrowing base formula, and in addition provides for a revolving credit, letter of credit and swing line loan facility for European borrowers allowing borrowing up to an aggregate principal amount of   $30,000,000   at variable rates, subject to availability based on a borrowing base formula. As of   September 30, 2016  , the company had   $13,350,000   in principal amount outstanding in principal on its 4.125% Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures due in February 2027, of which   $544,000   is included in equity, and   $150,000,000   in principal amount outstanding on its 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021, unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.

Part II.  OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings.  
    
  In the ordinary course of its business, the company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits, primarily product liability actions in which various plaintiffs seek damages for injuries allegedly caused by defective products. All of the product liability lawsuits that the company faces in the United States have been referred to the company's captive insurance company and/or excess insurance carriers while all non-U.S. lawsuits have been referred to the company's commercial insurance carriers. All such lawsuits are generally contested vigorously. The coverage territory of the company's insurance is worldwide with the exception of those countries with respect to which, at the time the product is sold for use or at the time a claim is made, the U.S. government has suspended or prohibited diplomatic or trade relations. Management does not believe that the outcome of any of these actions will have a material adverse effect upon the company's business or financial condition. 
  In December 2012, the company reached agreement with the FDA on the terms of a consent decree of injunction with respect to the company's Corporate facility and its Taylor Street wheelchair manufacturing facility in Elyria, Ohio.  A complaint and consent decree were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and on December 21, 2012, the Court approved the consent decree and it became effective. The consent decree limits the company's manufacture and distribution of power and manual wheelchairs, wheelchair components and wheelchair sub-assemblies at or from its Taylor Street manufacturing facility. The decree also initially limited design activities related to wheelchairs and power beds that take place at the impacted Elyria, Ohio facilities. The company is entitled to continue to produce from the Taylor Street manufacturing facility certain medically necessary wheelchairs provided that documentation and record-keeping requirements are followed, as well as ongoing replacement, service and repair of products already in use, under terms delineated in the consent decree. Under the terms of the consent decree, in order to resume full operations at the impacted facilities, the company must successfully complete third-party expert certification audits at the impacted Elyria facilities, which is comprised of three distinct reports that must be submitted to, and accepted by, the FDA. During 2013, the company completed the first two of the third-party expert certification audits, and the FDA found the results of both to be acceptable. In these reports, the third-party expert certified that the company's equipment and process validation procedures and its design control systems are compliant with the FDA's QSR. As a result of the FDA's acceptance of the first certification report on May 13, 2013, the Taylor Street facility was able to resume supplying parts and components for the further manufacturing of medical devices at other company facilities. The company's receipt of the FDA's acceptance of the second certification report on July 15, 2013, resulted in the company being able to resume design activities at the impacted facilities related to power wheelchairs and power beds. In February, 2016, the independent expert auditor issued its certification report for the third phase of the consent decree indicating substantial compliance with the FDA's QSR and the report was submitted to the FDA.   Similar to the first and second certification processes, the FDA has responded to this report with clarifying questions to which the company and the independent expert have responded. When the FDA's questions are satisfactorily addressed, the company intends to request a meeting with the FDA prior to submitting its own written report required by the terms of the consent decree. 
   In December 2015, the FDA issued Form 483 observations following a 2015 inspection of approximately 5 months at the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities in Elyria, Ohio which included a review of the company s compliance with the terms of the consent decree and the matters covered by the first and second expert certification reports previously accepted in 2013 (the  December 2015 Form 483 ).  The company has timely filed its responses to this Form 483 and continues to work on addressing the FDA s observations. 
  On June 7, 2016, the company received a letter from the FDA in follow up to the December 2015 Form 483 and the company s subsequent responses to the Form 483. To satisfy FDA s design control requirements, the FDA letter outlined additional steps the company must take. In particular, the FDA clarified its requirement for the company to complete the remediation of certain design history files (DHFs) referenced in the December 2015 Form 483 and in the consent decree. Before the company can design any new Taylor Street wheelchair devices, the specified DHFs must be completed, then recertified by the company s third-party expert, whose updated report must be accepted by the FDA. The FDA also clarified that its acceptance of the expert s updated report on these DHFs is a prerequisite to proceeding further with the third certification process. The FDA has clarified that the DHFs associated with certain power wheelchair and power bed products which the company is planning to discontinue by year end would not need to be remediated. 
  Under the terms of the consent decree, the company must submit its own written report to the FDA regarding its compliance status together with its written responses to any observations in the independent expert's report. The independent third-party expert auditor's third certification report, as well as the company's own report, both must be accepted by the FDA before the agency

reinspects the impacted Elyria facilities. If the FDA is satisfied with the company's compliance, the FDA will provide written notification that the company is permitted to resume full operations at the impacted facilities. The company cannot predict the acceptance of these reports by the FDA, the timing of the inspection, nor any remaining work that may be needed to meet the FDA's requirements to resume full operations at the impacted facilities. The FDA has the authority to inspect any FDA registered facility at any time. 
  After resumption of full operations, the company must undergo five years of audits by a third-party expert auditor to determine whether the facilities are in continuous compliance with FDA regulations and the consent decree. The auditor will inspect the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities  activities every six months during the first year following the resumption of full operations and then once every 12 months for the next four years thereafter.   
  Under the consent decree, the FDA has the authority to inspect the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities at any time.  The FDA also has the authority to order the company to take a wide variety of actions if the FDA finds that the company is not in compliance with the consent decree or FDA regulations, including requiring the company to cease all operations relating to Taylor Street products. The FDA also can order the company to undertake a partial cessation of operations or a recall, issue a safety alert, public health advisory, or press release, or to take any other corrective action the FDA deems necessary with respect to Taylor Street products.  
  The FDA also has authority under the consent decree to assess liquidated damages of $15,000 per violation per day for any violations of the consent decree, FDA regulations or the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  The FDA also may assess liquidated damages for shipments of adulterated or misbranded devices, except as permitted by the consent decree, in the amount of twice the sale price of any such adulterated or misbranded device. The liquidated damages are capped at $7,000,000 for each calendar year. The liquidated damages are in addition to any other remedies otherwise available to the FDA, including civil money penalties. 
  For additional information regarding the consent decree, please see the following sections of company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2015: Item 1. Business - Government Regulation; Item 1A.  Risk Factors; and Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Outlook and - Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
  In December 2010, the company received a warning letter from the FDA related to quality system processes and procedures at the company's Sanford, Florida facility. In January 2014, the FDA conducted inspections at the company s manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China and at the company s electronic components subsidiary in Christchurch, New Zealand, covering quality systems and current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. In August 2014, the FDA inspected Alber GmbH in Albstadt, Germany. The FDA issued its inspectional observations on Forms 483 to the company after these inspections, and the company submitted its responses to the agency in a timely manner. In October 2014, the FDA conducted an inspection at the Sanford facility and, at the conclusion, issued its Form 483 inspectional observations. In December 2015, the FDA issued Form 483 observations following a 2015 inspection of approximately 5 months at the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities in Elyria, Ohio. In July 2016, the FDA inspected Motion Concepts L.P. in Concord, Ontario, Canada and issued its inspectional observations on Form 483. The company has timely filed its responses to these Forms 483 with the FDA and continues to work on addressing the FDA's observations. The results of regulatory claims, proceedings, investigations, or litigation are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution or outcome of the FDA warning letter or other FDA enforcement related to the Sanford facility or other company facilities could materially and adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. See Item 1. Business - Government Regulation - Other FDA Matters and 1A. Risk Factors in company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2015. 
  On September 12, 2014, an amended complaint, in a lawsuit originally instituted on August 26, 2013, was filed against Invacare Corporation, former officer and director Gerald B. Blouch, former officer and director A. Malachi Mixon III, and the company's Senior Vice President, Human Resources, Patricia Stumpp, as well as outside directors Dale C. LaPorte and Michael F. Delaney and former outside director Charles S. Robb, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties and violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in the administration and maintenance of the company stock fund in the company s Retirement Savings Plan (401(k) Plan). The lawsuit seeks class certification and unspecified damages and attorneys' fees for participants in the company's stock fund of the 401(k) Plan between July 22, 2010 and the present. On August 28, 2015, the Court limited plaintiff s claim to the time period between July 22, 2010 and December 8, 2011. This lawsuit has been referred to the company's insurance carriers. Following mediation,

    In 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the company to purchase up to 2,000,000 Common Shares, excluding any shares acquired from employees or directors as a result of the exercise of options or vesting of restricted shares pursuant to the company s performance plans. The Board of Directors reaffirmed its authorization of this repurchase program on November 5, 2010, and on August 17, 2011 authorized an additional 2,046,500 shares for repurchase under the plan. To date, the company has purchased 1,592,522 shares under this program, with authorization remaining to purchase 2,453,978 shares. The company purchased no shares pursuant to this Board authorized program during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . Under the terms of the company's Credit Agreement, repurchases of shares by the company generally are not permitted except in certain limited circumstances in connection with the vesting or exercise of employee equity compensation awards.

  CERTIFICATIONS 
  I, Matthew E. Monaghan, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Invacare Corporation; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:
