Notes to   the   Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1:    Basis of Presentation and Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

Description of Business.      A. H. Belo Corporation and subsidiaries   are referred to collectively herein as    A. H. Belo  or the  Company  .      The Company,   headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a leading local news and information publishing company with commercial printing, distribution and direct mail capabilities, as well as expertise in emerging media and   digital   marketing. With a continued focus on extendin  g the Company s media platform,   A.     H.     Belo deliver  s   news and information in innovative ways to a broad spectrum of audiences with diverse interests and lifestyles.     The Company publishes   The Dallas Morning News   (  www.dallasnews.com  ), Texas  leading newspaper and winner of nine Pulitzer Prizes; the   Denton Record-Chronicle   (  www.dentonrc.com  ), a daily newspaper operating in Denton, Texas, and various niche publications targeting specific audiences. A. H. Belo also offers digital marketing solutions   through Your Speakeasy, LLC ( Speakeasy ) and DMV Digital Holdings Company ( DMV   Holdings )  , and provides event promotion and marketing services through   DMN CrowdSource LLC ( CrowdSource   ). 

Basis of Presentation.       The interim consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they include adjustments of a normal recurring nature which, in the Company s opinion, are necessary to present fairly the interim consolidated financial information as of and for the periods indicated.   All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. A. H. Belo consolidates the financial results of the entities in which   it has controlling financial interest  s, including Speakeasy   and DMV Holdings, in which the Company holds ownership percentages of   70     percent and   80   percent, respectively  .     As a consequence, the assets and liabilities of such entities are presented on a consolidated basis in A. H. Belo s financial statements.   These   financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. All dollar amounts presented herein, except share and per share amounts, are in thousands, unless the context requires otherwise. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and (iii) the reported amount of net operating revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. Adjustments made with respect to the use of estimates often relate to improved information not previously available. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements; accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. 

In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-05           Intangibles   Goodwill and Other   Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.   This update provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The standard became effective for annual and interim reporting periods beg  inning after December 15, 2015.   The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In   September   2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16         Business Combinations (Topic 805):   Simplifying the Accounting   for   Measurement-Period Adjustments.   This update requires that an acquirer in a business combination recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The acquirer is required to record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this update with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company adopted this standard in the f  ourth   quarter of 201  5  .    Accordingly, the Company has not retroactively accounted for the changes in the purchase price allocation for DMV Holdings, which was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2015  . 

In   March   2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09     Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  : Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .    The amendments in this update affect all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The areas for simplification in this update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of

Table of Contents  

cash flows. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. T  he Company early adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2016. Adoption of this standard did not materially impact the Company's financial statements. 

New Accounting Pronouncements.      The FASB has issued the following accounting pronouncements and guidance which may be applicable to the Company but have not yet become effective. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued     ASU 2014-09          Revenue   from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   This guidance is intended to improve the financial reporting requirements for revenue from contracts with customers by providing a principle  -  based approach. It also requires disclosures designed to enable readers of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Further, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08           Revenue from Contr  acts with Customers (Topic 606):   Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),   and in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10           Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606):   Identifying Performance Obligations and   Licensing  . In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12     Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  . These updates clarify implementation guidance on the related topic. The accounting guidance updates will replace most existing revenue   recognition guidance in GAAP. The standard was to be effective for annual and interim reporting periods begi  nning after December 15, 2016.   ASU 2015-14 deferred the effective date of this update for all entities by one year. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of these updates and has not yet determined its impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02     Leases (Topic 842).   This   update requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of its leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will generally be based on the liability. For income statement purposes operating leases will result in straight-line expense and finance leases will result in expenses similar to current capital leases. The guidance also requires additional disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of this update and has not yet determined its impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07     Investments   Equity Method   and Joint Ventures (Topic 323):   Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.   This update addresses the use of the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The amendments in this update eliminate the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of this update and has not yet determined its impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Note   2  :  Segment Reporting 

The Company   s operating segments are based on internal management reporting   as well as product and service offerings  , and are defined as  : Publishing ( Publishing ) and Marketing, Event Marketing and Other Services ( MEMO ).

These operations generate revenue from sales of advertising within newspaper and digital platforms, subscription and retail sales of newspapers and commercial printing and distribution services primarily related to national and regional newspapers and preprint advertisers. Businesses within the Publishing segment lever  age production facilities,   subscriber base   and   digital news platforms to provide additional contribution margin. The Company   assesses the performance of   Publishing operations   on the basis of   operating profit and cash flows from operating activities. 

The MEMO segment is comprised of the Company s marketing, event marketing and other businesses. Marketing services and product offerings include multi-channel marketing services and software, targeted-channel marketing services, marketing analytics, content development, social media management and other consulting services. Marketing services also include non-digital marketing products, including sales of business promotional   items   and sales of pay-for-performance services directed primarily to other newspaper companies.

The following tables show summarized financial information for the Company s reportable segments. 

Note 3: Sales of Assets 

Assets held for sale include long-lived assets being actively marketed for which a sale is considered probable within the next 12 months. These assets are recorded at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell or their carrying value at the time they are classified as   a  ssets held for sale.   In the third quarter   of 2016  , the Company   commenced due diligence related to the sale of a parking lot located in downtown Dallas, Texas  . Th  is   asset, with a total carrying value of $2,600  ,   is reported as   a  ssets held for sale as of   September 30  ,    2016  .

The Company received net proceeds of $6,119 in the second quarter of 2015 upon closing of the transaction, generating a loss of $2  65  , which was offset by $328 of returned escrow received in the second quarter of 2016. Also during the second quarter of 2015, the Company demolished existing structures on an additional property in Providence, Rhode Island, at a cost of $412.

In addition, stock options may be accompanied by full and limited stock appreciation rights. Rights and limited stock appreciation rights may also be issued without accompanying stock options.   Awards under the Plan were also granted to holders of stock options issued by A.H. Belo s former parent company in connection with the Company s separation from its former parent in 2008. 

Stock Options.        S  tock options granted under the Plan are fully vested and exercisable.   No   options have been granted since 2009, and all compensation expense associated with stock options has been fully recognized as of   September 30, 2016  . 

The table below sets forth a summary of stock option activity under   the P  lan.

Restricted Stock Units.        T  he   Company s   RSUs have   a    service condition   and, subject to retirement eligibility,   vest over a period of up to   three     years. Vested RSUs are redeemed   60     percent in A. H. Belo Series A common stock and   40   percent in   cash over a period of three years. As of   September 30, 2016  , the liability for the portion of the award to be redeemed in cash was   $793  . The table below sets forth   a summary of RSU activity under   the P  lan. 

For   the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company   issued   86,  00  7   shares that were previously vested as of December 31, 2015. In addition, there were   223,67  6   and   224,91  1   RSUs that were vested and outstanding   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

The fair value of RSU grants is determined using the closing trading price of the Company s Series A common stock on the grant date.   As of   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized compensation   expense   related to non-vested RSUs   totaled   $496  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period   of   1.  1   years. 

Compensation Expense.           A. H. Belo recognizes compensation expense for   awards     granted     under the P  lan over the vesting period of the award. Compensation   expense related to RSUs granted under the Plan is   set forth in the table below. 

Note   6  :  Income Taxes 

The interim provision for income taxes reflects the Company s estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applied for the full fiscal year, adjusted for any discrete transactions which are reported in the period in which they occur. The estimated annual effective tax rate is reviewed each quarter based on the Company s estimated income tax expense for the year. Under certain circumstances, the Company may be precluded from estimating an annual effective tax rate. Such circumstances may include periods in which tax rates vary significantly due to earnings trends, in addition to the existence of significant permanent or temporary differences. Under such circumstances, a discrete tax rate is calculated for the period. 

The Company recognized income tax pr  ovision (benefit) from continuing operations of   $77   and   $(188)   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and   $1,361   and   $(5,601)   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. Effective income tax rates from continuing operations were   137.5   percent and   56.3   percent for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     and 2015, respectively.   The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was higher   when compared to the prior year period   due to taxable income  , changes in valuation allowance   and the disposit  ion of fixed assets  . 

Note   7  :    Pension and Other Retirement Plans 

Defined Benefit Plans.        The Company sponsors   the A. H. Belo Pension Plans, which provide benefits to approximately   2,300   current and former employees of the Company. A. H. Belo Pension Plan I   provides benefits to certain   current and former   employees primarily employed with   The Dallas Morning News   or the A. H. Belo corporate offices. A. H. Belo Pension Plan II provides benefits to certain   former   employees of The Providence Journal Company  .     This   obligation was retained by the Company   upon the   sale of the  

12           A. H. Belo Corporation Third Quarter 2016 on Form 10-Q 

Table of Contents  

newspaper operations of   The Providence Journal  .    No   additional benefits are accruing under the A. H. Belo Pension Plans, as future benefits were frozen  . 

No contributions are required to the A. H. Belo Pension Plans in 2016   under the applicable tax and labor laws governing pension plan funding. 

Net Periodic Pension Benefit 

The Company   s   estimates   of   net periodic pension expense or benefit   are   based on the e  xpected return on plan assets,   interest on   the   projected   benefit   obligations and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses   that are deferred   in accumulated other comprehensive loss  .    The table below sets forth components of net periodic pension benefit. 

Defined Contribution Plans.        The A. H. Belo Savings Plan, a defined contribution 401(k) plan, covers substantially all employees of A. H. Belo. Participants may elect to contribute a portion of their pretax compensation as provided by the plan and the Internal Revenue Code.

judgment of management, adverse judgments or outcomes are probable and the financial impact, should an adverse outcome occur, is reasonably estimable. The determination of likely outcomes of litigation matters relates to factors that include, but are not limited to, past experience and other evidence, interpretation of relevant laws or regulations and the specifics and status of each matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and financial exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from estimates and accruals. 

The Company is currently involved in a dispute with a customer regarding performance and pricing terms with respect to a change order to its printing services contract with the Company. Although the Company believes its position related to the contract can be sustained on its legal merits, it is reasonably possible that losses from   zero   up to the total amount of disputed invoices, totaling   approximately $1,500  , could be incurred in connection with the dispute. 

In the   opinion of management, liabilities, if any, arising from   other currently existing claims against the Company   would not have a material adverse effect on A. H. Belo s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. 

Pro-rata dis  tributions  .        In con  nection   with the acquisition of DMV Holdings, the   shareholder   agreement provides for a pro-rata   di  stribution   of   100   percent and   50   percent of DMV Holdings      free     cash flow for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, respectively. Free     cash     flow is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures, debt amortization and interes  t expense, as applicable. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made pro-rata distributions to noncontrolling interests   of   $264   in   connection   with this agreement based on 2015 free cash flow as defined. 

Note 1  1  :  Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest 

In connection with the acquisition of DMV Holdings, the Company entered into a shareholder agreement which provides for a put option to a noncontrolling shareholder. The put option provides the shareholder with the right to require the Company to purchase up to 25 percent of   the noncontrolling   ownership interest   in DMV Holdings   between the second and third anniversaries of the agreement and up to 50     percent of   the noncontrolling   ownership interest   in DMV Holdings   between the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the agreement. 

The exercisability of the noncontrolling interest put   option   is outside the control of the Company. As such, the redeemable noncontrolling   interest of   $1,335   and $  1,421 is reported in the mezzanine equity section   of   the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. In the event that the put option expire  s   unexercised, the related portion of noncontrolling interest would be classified as a component of equity in the   C  onsolidated   B  alance   S  heets. 

Redeemable noncontrolling interest is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and the carrying value   is   adjusted each period for its share of the earnings related to DMV Holdings. After the carrying value is adjusted for its share of the earnings related to DMV Holdings, the carrying value is adjusted for the change in fair value, which is the greater of the estimated redemption value or the value that would otherwise be assigned if the interest was not redeemable. Adjustments are recorded to retained earnings or additional paid in capital, as applicable, and have no   effect to earn  ings of the Company. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,    redeemable noncontrolling interest was increased by   $13   for its share of the DMV Holdings  earnings and decreased by   $99   for   distributions related to 2015 free cash flow as required under the shareholder agreement  .

RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS 

Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations 

The table below sets forth the components of A. H. Belo s   operating income (loss) by segment. 

Traditionally, t  he Company s   primary   revenue  s     are   generated from advertising within its core newspapers, niche publications and related websites and from subscription and single copy sales of its printed newspapers. As a result of competitive   and economic   conditions, the newspaper industry ha  s   faced a significant revenue   decline   over the past decade.   Therefore, t  he Company has sought to diversify its revenue  s   through development and investment in   new product offerings, increased circulation rates and leveraging of its existing assets to offer cost efficient commercial printing and distribution services to its local markets. The Company continually evaluates the overall performance of its core products to ensure existing assets are deployed adequately to maximize return.  

The Company s a  dvertising revenue from   its   core newspapers continues to be adversely affected by   the shift of advertiser   spending to other forms of media   and the increased accessibility of free online news content, as well as news content from other sources, which resulted in declines in advertising and paid print circulation volumes and revenue.     The most significant decline in advertising revenue has been attributable to print display and classified categories  . These categories, which represented 29.9 percent of consolidated revenue in 2013, have declined to   20.5     percent of consolidated revenue thus far in   2016  , and further declines are likely in future periods.     Decreases in print display and classified categories are indicative of continuing trend  s by advertisers towards digital platforms  , which   are   widely available from many sources.   In the current environment, c  ompanies are   allocating   more of their advertising   spending   towards programmatic channels   that provide   digital advertising on multiple platforms   with enhanced technology for targeted delivery and measurement.   The Company has responded to these challenges by expanding   the   programmatic channels   through which it works to meet customer demand for digital advertisement opportunities in display, mobile, video and social media categories. By utilizing advertising exchanges to apply marketing insight, the Company believes it offers greater value to clients through focused targeting of advertising to potential customers. 

The Company s e  xpanded digital and marke  ting services product offerings   leverage the Company s existing resources and relationships to offer additional value to   existing   and new advertising clients.   Solutions provided by DMV Holdings include development of mobile websites, search engine marketing and optimization, video, mobile advertising, email marketing, advertising analytics and online reputation management services. Through Speakeasy, the Company is able to target middle-market business customers and provide turnkey social media account management and content development services.

Advertising and marketing services revenue 

Advertising and marketing services revenue   was     5  9  .  1   percent and   57.  5   percent of total revenue for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,    respectively,   and   58.6   percent and   57.4   percent for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

Publishing 

Display       Display revenue primarily represents sales of non-classified advertising space within the Company s core and niche newspapers.   As advertisers continue to diversify marketing budgets to incorporate more and varied avenues of reaching consumers, traditional display advertising continues to   decline. Revenue decreased due to lower retail advertising in substantially all categories except other retail in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and sporting goods in both periods. The department store, food and beverage, entertainment and furniture categories experienced the greatest declines with a combined revenue decrease of approximately $1,557 and $2,303, for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. The revenue decrease was driven heavily by a volume decline of 16.0 percent and 14.5 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Classified     Classified primarily represents sales of classified advertising space within the Company s core and niche newspapers.   Growth in c  lassified advertising   revenue continues to be   challeng  ing   as alternative digital outlets continue to emerge.   R  ate improvement trends in certain display advertising categories   partially offset the volume decline.     Overall classified revenue increased slightly during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due to lower volumes in all categories except real estate and legal. This decline was partially offset by higher rates in automotive and employment. 

Preprint     Preprint primarily reflects preprinted advertisements inserted into the Company s core newspapers and niche publications, or distributed to non-subscribers through the   mail. Revenue decreased due to a decline in the volume of preprint newspaper inserts, consistent with the decline in circulation volumes, discussed below, partially offset by higher volumes in home delivery mail advertising. 

Digital       Digital publishing is primarily comprised of banner and real estate classified advertising on   The Dallas Morning News    website   dallasnews.com   as well as online employment and obituary classified advertising on third-party websites sold under a print/digital bundle package  . Revenue decreased due to a lower volume of online banner advertisements on   dallasnews.com  . 

Marketing, Event Marketing and Other Services 

Digital services     Digital marketing includes targeted and multi-channel advertising placed on third-party websites, content development, social media management, search optimization, other consulting, and sales of online automotive classifieds on the   cars.com   platform  . The 2015 acquisition of DMV Holdings provided a significant portion of the growth in digital marketing revenue.   DMV Holdings revenue   increased $2,109 and $4,332 in the   three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016, respectively. The DMV Holdings revenue increase offset   approximately 61.6 percent and 46.0 percent   of the core print advertising revenue decline in the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016, respectively. 

Other   services       Other services revenue   increased $41  6   and $1,136   in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, due to t  he   sale   of promotional merchandise   by   MarketingFX  .

Circulation revenue 

Circulation revenue   was     30.  3   percent and   30.  8   percent of total revenue for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   respectively,   and   30.3   percent and   31.2   percent for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

Revenue decreased due to a decline in home delivery and single copy paid print circulation volumes of 9.2 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 8.5 percent and 14.1 percent, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These volume declines were partially offset by a rate increase of 6.9 percent in both periods for home delivery. 

Volume declines in circulation revenue have been more pronounced with single copy sales as it competes for retail space. Price increases and supplemental editions are critical to maintaining the revenue base to support this   product. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company generated $315 and $402, respectively, of incremental circulation revenue through the distribution of specialty magazines to its core subscribers. 

Printing, distribution and other revenue 

Printing, distribution and other revenue   was     10.  6   percent and   11.7   percent of total revenue for the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016,   respectively,   and   11.1   percent and   11.4   percent for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

Publishing        The Company aggressively market  s   the capacity of their printing and distribution assets to other newspapers that would benefit from cost sharing arrangements.   Revenue decreased due to a decline in volumes associated with certain national newspapers. This decrease was partially offset by commencement of printing operations related to a regional newspaper in January 2016. 

Marketing, Event Marketing and Other Services         CrowdSource,   t  he Company s event marketing provider, works closely with cities and other corporate sponsors to bring large entertainment events to local communities  .     Revenue   decreased $216 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and increased $603 for the nine months ended September   30, 2016. The decrease   for the three months ended September 30, 2016, is primarily related to an event hosted by CrowdSource in the third quarter of 2015, which the Company will not host in 2016.

Publishing 

Employee compensation and benefits     The Company continues to implement measures to optimize its workforce and reduce risk associated with future obligations   towards employee benefit plans  . Employee compensation and   benefits decreased $3,  863   and $5,  853   in the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016,   respectively,   due to headcount reductions within the Company   that were effected in the second half of 2015  . 

Other   production, distribution and operating costs       Expense decreased in     the Company s Publishing segment reflecting savings as the Company continues to manage discretionary spending. Savings were generated by reductions in temporary and personnel recruiting services, promotional spending and travel. 

Newsprint, ink and other supplies        Expense decreased due to reduced newsprint costs associated with lower circulation volumes from the Company and certain third-party newspapers and the discontinuation of unprofitable product lines. Newsprint   consumption for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015  ,   approximated   6,627   and   7,516   metric tons, respectively, at an average cost per metric ton   of   $542   and    $  550  , respectively.   Newsprint consumption for the nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015  ,   approximated     20,022   and   23,162   metric tons, respectively, at an average cost per metric   ton   of   $523     and   $543  , respectively.   The average purchase price for newsprint was   $561     and $  529   for   the three   months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  ,    and   $532   and   $551   for   the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Depreciation       Expense decreased due to a lower depreciable asset base as a higher level of in-service assets are now fully depreciated. 

Amortization      All definite-lived intangible assets are fully amortized. 

Marketing, Event Marketing and Other Services 

Employee compensation and benefits     Expense increased     in   the three   and nine months ended September 30  , 2016,   primarily related to the growth associated with DMV Holdings of $731 and $2,208, respectively.

The table below sets forth the other components of the Company s results of operations. 

Other Income (Expense)       Other income (expense) is primarily comprised   of losses from investments and gain (loss) on disposal of fixed assets. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company s ownership interest in Wanderful Media, LLC ( Wanderful ) decreased to less than 20 percent of the outstanding membership interests of Wanderful. Accordingly, the Company discontinued the use of the equity method of accounting for the investment in Wanderful, and began accounting for the investment   under the cost method. 

Tax provision          The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was higher when compared to the prior year period   due to taxable income  ,     changes in valuation allowance   and the disposit  ion of fixed assets  . 

Sales of Assets           Assets held for sale include long-lived assets being actively marketed for which a sale is considered probable within the next 12 months. These assets are recorded at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell or their carrying value at the time they are classified as   a  ssets held for sale.   In the third quarter of 2016  , the Company   commenced due diligence related to the sale of a parking lot located in downtown Dallas, Texas  . Th  is   asset, with a total carrying value of $2,600  ,   is reported as   a  ssets held for sale as of   September 30  ,    2016  . 

In June 2015, the Company completed the sale of land and a building which served as the headquarters of   The Providence Journal  , a publication formerly owned by the Company. The Company received net proceeds of $6,119 in the second quarter of 2015 upon closing of the transaction, generating a loss of $2  65  , which was offset by $328 of returned escrow received in the second quarter of 2016. Also during the second quarter of 2015, the Company demolished existing structures on an additional property in Providence, Rhode Island, at a cost of $412. 

Legal proceedings         From time to time, the Company is involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. Management routinely assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters, as well as the ranges of probable losses to the extent losses are reasonably estimable. Accruals for contingencies are recorded when, in the judgment of management, adverse judgments or outcomes are probable and the financial impact, should an adverse outcome occur, is reasonably estimable. The determination of likely outcomes of litigation matters relates to factors that include, but are not limited to, past experience and other evidence, interpretation of relevant laws or regulations and the specifics and status of each matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and financial exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from estimates and accruals. 

The Company is currently involved in a dispute with a customer regarding performance and pricing terms with respect to a change order to its printing services contract with the Company. Although the Company believes its position related to the contract can be sustained on its legal merits, it is reasonably possible that losses   from zero up   to the total amount of disputed invoices, totaling   approximately $1,500  , could be incurred in connection with the dispute.

The Company intends to hold existing cash for purposes of future investment opportunities, potential return of capital to shareholders and for contingency purposes. Although revenue from publishing operations is expected to continue to decline in future periods, operating contributions expected from the Company s marketing services businesses, as well as planned adjustments for tax, pension and other cost cutting measures, are expected to be sufficient to fund operating activities   and capital spending of   approximately $  2  ,000   over the   remainder of the year  .

Exhibit 10.2(1)(a)

Exhibit   10.  2(1)(a) 

FIRST AMENDMENT   TO THE   A. H. BELO   SAVINGS PLAN 

A. H. Belo Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to its authority to amend the A. H. Belo Savings Plan (the  Plan ) contained in Article 15 of the Plan,  hereby adopts this First Amendment to the A. H. Belo Savings Plan (the "Plan"). 

1.       The first sentence of Section 7.1(a) of the Plan is deleted in its entirety and amended and replaced with the following effective with respect to distributions commenced on or after January 1  , 2016: 

(a)       Timing of Distributions.   Except as set forth in Sections 7.1(a) through (d), 7.2 and 7.3, distribution of a Participant s vested Account balance will be made as soon as practicable after the Valuation Date coinciding with or immediately following the Participant s termination of employment, or if earlier, the date on which the Participant becomes eligible to receive benefits under the Social Security Act on account of total and permanent disability. 

2.       The first sentence of Section 7.1(b) of the Plan is deleted in its entirety and amended and replaced with the following effective with respect to distributions commenced on or after   January 1, 2016: 

(b)   Form of Distributions.    Except as provided in Section 7.2(a) through (f) below, distributions made before age 70 and   years will be in the form of a single lump sum payment. 

3.     Section 7.2 of the Plan is deleted in its entirety and amended and replaced to read as follows effective with respect to distributions commenced on and after of January 1  , 2016: 

7.2      Withdrawals  .    

(a)      After Age 59  While In Service  .  A Participant who has not terminated employment may request a distribution from his Account if he has reached age 59  years.  A Participant who is a director, officer or principal stockholder of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may exercise the foregoing withdrawal right only in accordance with rules and procedures established from time to time by the Committee.    Participants may exercise their withdrawal rights under this Section 7.2(a) a maximum of one time during each quarter of the Plan Year. 

(b)      After Termination of Employment  .  A Participant may elect to receive either (i) his entire account in a single sum payment under Section 7.1, or (ii) up to five (5) withdrawals in a calendar year followed by a lump sum distribution of the entire remaining account upon the sixth withdrawal request in a calendar year in a single sum payment pursuant to Section 7.2(c) provided such withdrawals meet the requirements for satisfying the minimum required distributions under Sections 12.4 through 12.8 hereof, when such rules are applicable. Notwithstanding the provision for withdrawals in Section 7.2(c) below, in the event a withdrawal reduces a Participant s vested Account balance to $1,000 or less, his full account shall be automatically distributed pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof.    

(c)      Withdrawals Following Termination of Employment  .  A Participant who has terminated employment may request a distribution from his Account without requesting a full distribution of his account for up to five (5) separate withdrawal requests in a calendar year, and the sixth withdrawal request in a calendar year will result in a lump sum distribution of all of his vested  

benefits remaining in his A    ccount, provided such withdrawals must comply with the requirements of Sections 12.4 through 12.8 hereof, once the Participant attains the age of 70 and   years. Such withdrawal distributions shall be available to a Participant according to the procedures and limitations established by the Plan Administrator from time to time. There shall be no minimum withdrawal amount required.  Any such withdrawal shall be subject to any fees which may be charged for processing a withdrawal, if any. A Participant who is a director, officer or principal stockholder of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may exercise the foregoing withdrawal right only in accordance with rules and procedures established from time to time by the Committee.   

(d)      Former Journal Broadcasting Employees  .  A Participant who, on December 31, 1997, was a participant in the Journal Broadcasting 401(k) Plan may withdraw, in accordance with rules and procedures established from time to time by the Committee, all or any portion of his Rollover Account attributable to his after-tax contributions and rollover contributions that were transferred to the Plan from the Journal Broadcasting 401(k) Plan effective January 1, 1998. 

(e)      Qualified Reservist Distributions  .  Effective January 1, 2011, a Participant may elect to receive a  qualified reservist distribution  within the meaning of Code section 72(t)(2)(G)(iii). 

(f)      Deemed Severance From Employment  . Effective January 1, 2011, a Participant will be treated as having incurred a severance from employment with the Controlled Group for purposes of Code section 401(k)(2)(B)(i)(1) during any period that the Participant is performing service in the uniformed services described in Code section 3401(h)(2)(A).  A Participant who receives a distribution from the Plan by reason of this Section 7.2(d) will have his Deferral Contributions suspended for a period of six months beginning on the date of distribution. 

4.    Distribution Procedures.  Section 7.4 of the Plan is deleted in its entirety and amended and replaced to read as follows effective as of   January 1, 2016: 

7.4      Distribution Procedures  .  Distributions pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 7.3 will be made as soon as practicable following the Committee s approval of the Participant s written request for withdrawal and will be made in the form described in Section 7.1(b).  Distributions pursuant to Sections 7.2(a)-(d) and 7.3 will be made pro rata from each contribution source in the Participant s Account, provided, however, that in the case of a hardship distribution under Section 7.3, the cumulative amount distributed to a Participant from his Deferral Contribution Account will not exceed the amount of his Deferral Contributions that have not been previously withdrawn (but not the income allocable to his Deferral Contributions).  No distribution under Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 will be made in an amount that is greater than the excess of the Participant s vested interest in the Account from which the distributions are made over the aggregate amount of outstanding loans, plus accrued interest, secured by such Account.  For purposes of determining the amount available for distribution, a Participant s Account will be valued as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date on which the Participant requests a distribution.  

5  .    No other provision of the Plan is amended by this First Amendment to the Plan.
