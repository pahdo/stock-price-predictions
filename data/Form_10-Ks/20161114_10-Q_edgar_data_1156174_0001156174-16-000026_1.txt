  September 30, 2016 and 2015 

NOTE 1    .    NATURE OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Principal Business Activity 
    
  Lake Area Corn Processors, LLC and subsidiary (the Company) is a South Dakota limited liability company.  
    
  The Company owns and manages Dakota Ethanol, LLC (Dakota Ethanol), a   40 million  -gallon (annual nameplate capacity) ethanol plant, located near Wentworth, South Dakota.  Dakota Ethanol sells ethanol and related products to customers located in North America.  
    
  In addition, the Company has investment interests in   five   companies in ethanol-related industries.  See note 4 for further details. 

NOTE 2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The unaudited financial statements contained herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information not misleading. 
    
  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the accompanying financial statements.  The results of operations for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year. 
    
  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , contained in the annual report on Form 10-K for 2015. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of its wholly owned subsidiary, Dakota Ethanol.  All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Revenue from the production of ethanol and related products is recorded when title transfers to customers. Generally, ethanol and related products are shipped FOB shipping point, based on written contract terms between Dakota Ethanol and its customers.  Collectability of revenue is reasonably assured based on historical evidence of collectability between Dakota Ethanol and its customers.  Interest income is recognized as earned. 
    
  Shipping costs incurred by the Company in the sale of ethanol, dried distiller's grains and corn oil are not specifically identifiable and as a result, revenue from the sale of those products is recorded based on the net selling price reported to the Company from the marketer. 
    
  Cost of Revenues    
    
  The primary components of cost of revenues from the production of ethanol and related co-product are corn expense, energy expense (natural gas and electricity), raw materials expense (chemicals and denaturant), and direct labor costs.  
    
  Shipping costs on modified and wet distiller s grains are included in cost of revenues.   
    
  Inventory Valuation 
    
  Inventories are generally valued using methods which approximate the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value.  In the valuation of inventories and purchase commitments, net realizable value is based on estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Investment in commodities contracts, derivative instruments and hedging activities 
    
  The Company is exposed to certain risks related to our ongoing business operations.  The primary risks that the Company manages by using forward or derivative instruments are price risk on anticipated purchases of corn and natural gas and the sale of ethanol, distillers grains and distillers corn oil.  
     
  The Company is subject to market risk with respect to the price and availability of corn, the principal raw material the Company uses to produce ethanol and ethanol by-products.  In general, rising corn prices result in lower profit margins and, therefore, represent unfavorable market conditions.  This is especially true when market conditions do not allow us to pass along increased corn costs to our customers.  The availability and price of corn is subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather conditions, farmer planting decisions, governmental policies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global demand and supply.  
    
  Certain contracts that literally meet the definition of a derivative may be exempted from derivative accounting as normal purchases or normal sales.  Normal purchases and normal sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of something other than a financial instrument or derivative instrument that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business.  Contracts that meet the requirements of normal purchases or sales are documented as normal and exempted from the accounting and reporting requirements of derivative accounting.   
    
  The Company does not apply the normal purchase and sales exemption for forward corn purchase contracts.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is committed to purchasing approximately   3.9 million   bushels of corn on a forward contract basis with an average price of   $3.43   per bushel.  The total corn purchase contracts represent   20%   of the annual plant corn usage. 
    
  The Company enters into firm-price purchase commitments with natural gas suppliers under which the Company agrees to buy natural gas at a price set in advance of the actual delivery of that natural gas.  Under these arrangements, the Company assumes the risk of a price decrease in the market price of natural gas between the time this price is fixed and the time the natural gas is delivered.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company does not have any firm-price purchase commitments for natural gas.  The Company accounts for these transactions as normal purchases, and accordingly, does not mark these transactions to market. 
    
  The Company enters into firm-price sales commitments with distillers grains customers under which the Company agrees to sell distillers grains at a price set in advance of the actual delivery of the distillers grains.  Under these arrangements, the Company assumes the risk of a price increase in the market price of distillers grain between the time this price is fixed and the time the distillers grains are delivered.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company is committed to selling approximately   31,000   dry equivalent tons of distillers grains with an average price of   $115   per ton.  The Company accounts for these transactions as normal sales, and accordingly, does not mark these commitments to market.  The distillers grains sales represent approximately   20%   of the projected annual plant production. 
    
  The Company enters into firm-price sales commitments with distillers corn oil customers under which the Company agrees to sell distillers corn oil at a price set in advance of the actual delivery of the distillers corn oil.  Under these arrangements, the Company assumes the risk of a price increase in the market price of distillers corn oil between the time this price is fixed and the time the distillers corn oil is delivered.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company is committed to selling approximately   1,970,000   pounds of distillers corn oil with an average price of   $0.28   per pound.  The Company accounts for these transactions as normal sales, and accordingly, does not mark these commitments to market.  The distillers corn oil sales represent approximately   17%   of the projected annual plant production. 
    
  The Company does not have any firm-priced sales commitments for ethanol as of   September 30, 2016  .

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The Company enters into short-term forward, option and futures contracts for corn and natural gas as a means of managing exposure to changes in commodity and energy prices. The Company enters into short-term forward, option and futures contracts for sales of ethanol to manage exposure to changes in energy prices.  All of the Company's derivatives are designated as non-hedge derivatives, and accordingly are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Although the contracts are considered economic hedges of specified risks, they are not designated as and accounted for as hedging instruments.  
    
  Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

*Derived from audited financial statements. 
    
  Futures contracts and cash held by broker are all with one party and the right of offset exists.  Therefore, on the balance sheet, these items are netted in one balance regardless of position.   
    
  Forward contracts are with multiple parties and the right of offset does not exist.  Therefore, these contracts are reported at the gross amounts on the balance sheet. 
    
  Realized and unrealized gains and losses related to derivative contracts related to corn and natural gas purchases are included as a component of cost of revenues and derivative contracts related to ethanol sales are included as a component of revenues in the accompanying financial statements.

Investments 
    
  The Company has investment interests in   five   companies in related industries.  All of these interests are at ownership shares less than 20%. These investments are flow-through entities and are being accounted for by the equity method of accounting under which the Company s share of net income is recognized as income in the Company s statements of income and added to the investment account.  Distributions or dividends received from the investments are treated as a reduction of the investment account.  The Company consistently follows the practice of recognizing the net income from investments based on the most recent reliable data. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Significant estimates include the fair value of derivative financial instruments, lower of cost or net realizable value accounting for inventory and forward purchase contracts and goodwill impairment evaluation. 

NOTE 3.     INVENTORY 
    
  Inventory consisted of the following as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

NOTE 7.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  
    
  The Company complies with the fair value measurements and disclosures standard which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure for those assets and liabilities carried on the balance sheet on a fair value basis.   
    
  The Company s balance sheet contains derivative financial instruments that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.  Fair value measurements and disclosures require that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed according to the process for determining fair value.  There are three levels of determining fair value. 
    
  Level 1 uses quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
    
  Level 2 uses observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 
    
  Level 3 uses unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. 
    
  A description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below.  
    
  Derivative financial instruments  . Commodity futures and options contracts are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 inputs. For these contracts, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes and live trading levels from the CBOT and NYMEX markets.  Over-the-counter commodity options contracts are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs.  For these contracts, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service.  The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes and live trading levels from the over-the-counter markets.  Forward purchase contracts are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs.  For these contracts, the Company obtains fair value measurements from local grain terminal bid values. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include live trading bids from local elevators and processing plants which are based off the CBOT markets. 
    
  The following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value:

  Overview 
    
  Lake Area Corn Processors, LLC is a South Dakota limited liability company that owns and manages its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dakota Ethanol, LLC.  Dakota Ethanol, LLC owns and operates an ethanol plant located near Wentworth, South Dakota that has a nameplate production capacity of 40 million gallons of ethanol per year.  Lake Area Corn Processors, LLC is referred to in this report as "LACP," the "company," "we," or "us."  Dakota Ethanol, LLC is referred to in this report as "Dakota Ethanol" "we" "us" or the "ethanol plant." 
    
  Our revenue is derived from the sale and distribution of our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil.  The ethanol plant currently operates in excess of its nameplate capacity, producing approximately 50 million gallons of ethanol per year.  Corn is supplied to us primarily from our members who are local agricultural producers and from purchases of corn on the open market.  We have engaged Renewable Products Marketing Group, Inc. ("RPMG, Inc.") to market all of the ethanol and corn oil that we produce at the ethanol plant.  Further, RPMG, Inc. markets all of the distillers grains that we produce that we do not market internally to local customers. 
    
  We are in the process of expanding our railroad siding to accommodate shipping unit trains. The project reached substantial completion during the third quarter of 2016.  We are using cash from our continuing operations and amounts we have available to borrow on our long-term revolving debt to finance this capital project which is expected to cost approximately $7 million.  
    
  On September 23, 2016, the Chinese government instituted a 33.8% anti-dumping duty on all distillers grains produced in the United States and exported to China.  The Chinese claimed that ethanol producers in the United States were unfairly benefiting from subsidies which artificially lowered the price of distillers grains.  China is the world's top buyer of dried distillers grains and nearly all of the distillers grains China purchases come from the United States.  This trade dispute has resulted in fewer exports of distillers grains to China which has had a negative impact on market distillers grains prices received by ethanol producers in the United States.  Further, the Chinese duty is preliminary and it is possible that the final duty could be higher, further impacting distillers grains demand and prices.  Management believes that this trade dispute has negatively impacted our profitability which could continue.

Results of Operations  
    
  Comparison of the Fiscal Quarters Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  The following table shows the results of our operations and the percentage of revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and other items to total revenues in our consolidated statements of income for the fiscal quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Revenues     
    
  Revenue from ethanol sales decreased by approximately   6%   during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .  Revenue from distillers grains sales decreased by approximately   6%   during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .  Revenue from corn oil sales increased by approximately   2%   during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .  
    
  Ethanol 
    
  Our ethanol revenue was approximately   $960,000   less during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to our   third quarter of 2015  , a decrease of approximately   6%  .  This decrease in ethanol revenue was due to a decrease in the total gallons of ethanol we sold during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to our   third quarter of 2015  , along with a lower average ethanol price we received per gallon of ethanol sold during the 2016 period.  We sold approximately   2%   fewer gallons of ethanol during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , a decrease of approximately   201,000   gallons, due to decreased throughput at the ethanol plant.  Management anticipates relatively stable production for the rest of our 2016 fiscal year.           
    
  The average price we received for our ethanol was approximately   $0.05   less per gallon during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to our   third quarter of 2015  , a decrease of approximately   4%  .  Management attributes this decrease in ethanol prices with excess ethanol supply in the market and lower gasoline prices which both impacted ethanol demand and prices during our   third quarter of 2016  .  In addition, management believes the price of ethanol was negatively impacted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) renewable volume obligations under the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) which were finalized in November 2015 along with the proposed reduction in the renewable volume obligations for 2017 which were released in May 2016.  These renewable volume obligations were set by the EPA lower than the statutory requirements in the RFS.   
    
    Distillers Grains 
    
  Our total distillers grains revenue was approximately   6%   less during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to decreased total tons of distillers grains we sold.  For our   third quarter of 2016  , we sold approximately   44%   of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately   56%   of our total distillers grains in the modified/wet form.  By comparison, for our   third quarter of 2015  , we sold approximately   47%   of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately   53%   of our total distillers grains in the modified/wet form. We determine the mix between dried distillers grains and modified/wet distillers grains we sell based on market conditions and the relative profitability of selling the different forms of distillers grains.  Due to the lack of Chinese exports, prices in the modified/wet distillers grains market were better compared to the dried distillers grains market.  We consume additional natural gas when we produce dried distillers grains as compared to  
  
    17 

     Table of Contents  

modified/wet distillers grains which can impact the profit we generate from sales of dried distillers grains.  Management anticipates that we will maintain the current mix between dried distillers grains and modified/wet distillers grains going forward unless market conditions change in a way that favors one product over the other.    
    
  The average price we received for our dried distillers grains was approximately   9%   less during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , a decrease of approximately   $12   per ton.  Management attributes the decrease in dried distillers grains prices during the 2016 period with uncertainty in the export market for distillers grains due to the Chinese anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation.  The average price we received for our modified/wet distillers grains, on a dry-equivalent basis, was approximately   4%   less for our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , a decrease of approximately   $5   per ton.  Management attributes this decrease in modified/wet distillers grains prices with ample corn supplies in our local market along with additional distillers grains supply due to the Chinese anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation.  However, the local market prices did not decrease as much as the export market which resulted in a smaller decrease in our modified/wet distillers grains prices.  China instituted an anti-subsidy and countervailing duty investigation in January 2016 which essentially closed the Chinese market to United States produced distillers grains.  Since that time, the Chinese have sporadically taken distillers grains exports but at a lower level than in the past.  On September 23, 2016, China instituted a 33.8% duty on distillers grains exported from the United States.  Management believes this has resulted in decreased worldwide demand for distillers grains which has negatively impacted domestic distillers grains prices.  While we do not export a significant amount of distillers grains, the Chinese investigation has increased the domestic supply of distillers grains which has impacted local prices.  In addition, there are ample corn supplies in the United States which has also impacted demand for distillers grains.  Management expects distillers grains prices to remain lower in the near term, especially due to the strong corn crop which was harvested in the fall of 2016.  
       
    Corn Oil 
    
  Our total pounds of corn oil sold decreased by approximately   9%   during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , a decrease of approximately   258,000   pounds, primarily due to increased downtime for our corn oil extraction equipment and decreased corn oil yield per ton of distillers grains.  Management anticipates that corn oil production will return to more normal levels in the future and will continue to be variable based on the total production of ethanol at our plant and by operating efficiencies we achieve at the ethanol plant.  The average price we received for our corn oil was approximately   12%   greater for our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , an increase of approximately   $0.03   per pound.  Management believes this increase in market corn oil prices was primarily due to increased biodiesel demand which positively impacts corn oil prices along with increased soybean oil prices.  Soybean oil is another feedstock which is used to produce biodiesel so when soybean oil prices increase, it typically benefits the market price of corn oil.  The biodiesel blenders' tax credit was renewed at the end of December 2015 which management believes has positively impacted corn oil demand during 2016.  However, the tax credit is scheduled to expire again at the end of December 2016.  As a result, this increase in corn oil demand may not continue past our 2016 fiscal year.   
    
  Cost of Revenues     
    
  Our cost of revenues for our   third quarter of 2016   was lower compared to the same period of    2015   due primarily to decreased corn and natural gas consumption along with lower corn and natural gas prices.  The decrease in our corn consumption was due in part to decreased total production during the 2016 period along with greater efficiency in converting corn into ethanol during the 2016 period.  We have also improved our energy efficiency in producing ethanol and have produced more modified/wet distillers grains which decreases the amount of natural gas we consume in our production facility.  
    
  Our cost of revenues relating to corn was approximately   13%   less for our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to lower corn consumption and corn costs per bushel during the 2016 period.  Our average cost per bushel of corn decreased by approximately   10%   for our   third quarter of 2016   compared to our   third quarter of 2015  .  Management attributes the decrease in corn prices with anticipation regarding the size of the corn corp harvested in the fall of 2016 along with ample market supplies of corn.  Management anticipates that corn prices will remain relatively lower into the foreseeable future as corn is plentiful with relatively stable corn demand. 
    
  We consumed approximately   3%   fewer bushels of corn during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to decreased total production at the plant during 2016 and increased efficiency at the plant which increased the number of gallons of ethanol we produced per bushel of corn ground.  Management anticipates that our corn consumption will be relatively stable for the final quarter of our 2016 fiscal year compared to our 2015 fiscal year.   
    
  Our cost of revenues related to natural gas decreased by approximately   $71,000  , a decrease of approximately   6%  , for our   third quarter of 2016   compared to our   third quarter of 2015  .  This decrease was due to a decrease in market natural gas prices  
  
    18 

     Table of Contents  

during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   along with a decrease in our natural gas usage during the 2016 period.  Our average cost per MMBtu of natural gas during our   third quarter of 2016   was approximately   6%   lower compared to the cost per MMbtu for our   third quarter of 2015  .  Management attributes this decrease in our average natural gas costs with generally lower energy prices and ample supplies of natural gas in the market.  Management anticipates that natural gas prices will remain relatively stable.  However, if natural gas production problems occur, it could result in higher natural gas prices which could negatively impact our profitability.  
    
  We used approximately   1%   fewer MMBtus of natural gas during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due primarily to decreased total production, energy improvement projects we completed along with more production of modified/wet distillers grains which requires less natural gas to produce.  Management anticipates that our natural gas consumption will remain at current levels for the final quarter of our 2016 fiscal year and into our 2017 fiscal year.    
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  Our operating expenses were greater for our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due primarily to increased environmental costs.  
    
  Other Income and Expense    
    
  Our interest income was less for our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to having less cash on hand during the 2016 period.  Our income related to our investments was greater during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to improved profitability in the ethanol industry which impacts our portion of the net income generated by our investments, including Guardian Hankinson, LLC and RPMG, because both are involved in the ethanol industry.  Our interest expense was lower during our   third quarter of 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to having less borrowings outstanding on our loans during the 2016 period.   
    
  Comparison of the Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  The following table shows the results of our operations and the percentage of revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and other items to total revenues in our consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Revenues     
    
  Revenue from ethanol sales was approximately   2%   less during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to the net effect of increased production and decreased average ethanol prices.  Revenue from distillers grains sales decreased by approximately   6%   during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .  Revenue from corn oil sales decreased by approximately   9%   during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .

Ethanol 
    
  Our ethanol revenue was approximately   $1,113,000   less during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to our   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , a decrease of approximately   2%  .  This decrease in ethanol revenue was due to the net effect of an increase in the total gallons of ethanol we sold during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to our   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , offset by a decrease in the average price we received per gallon of ethanol sold during the 2016 period.  We sold approximately   2%   more gallons of ethanol during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , an increase of approximately   663,000   gallons, due to increased production capacity at the ethanol plant due to various plant improvement projects which were completed during our 2015 fiscal year.  
    
  The average price we received for our ethanol was approximately   $0.05   less per gallon during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to our   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , a decrease of approximately   4%  .  Management attributes this decrease in ethanol prices with excess ethanol supply in the market and lower gasoline prices which both impacted ethanol demand and prices during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
    Distillers Grains 
    
  Our total distillers grains revenue was approximately   6%   less during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to decreased average distillers grains prices, partially offset by an increase in the total tons of distillers grains we sold.  For our   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold approximately   32%   of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately   68%   of our total distillers grains in the modified/wet form.  By comparison, for our   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we sold approximately   36%   of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately   64%   of our total distillers grains in the modified/wet form.    
    
  The average price we received for our dried distillers grains was approximately   9%   less during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , a decrease of approximately   $12   per ton.  Management attributes the decrease in dried distillers grains prices during the 2016 period with decreased export demand for distillers grains.  The average price we received for our modified/wet distillers grains, on a dry-equivalent basis, was approximately   6%   less for our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , a decrease of approximately   $8   per ton.  
       
    Corn Oil 
    
  Our total pounds of corn oil sold decreased by approximately   10%   during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , a decrease of approximately   815,000   pounds, primarily due to increased downtime for our corn oil extraction equipment.  The average price we received for our corn oil was comparable for our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the same period of   2015  .   
    
  Cost of Revenues     
    
  Our cost of revenues for our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   5%   lower compared to the same period of   2015   due to decreased consumption and prices for our primary raw materials, corn and natural gas.  The decreases in consumption were primarily due to improved yields and energy efficiency during the 2016 period.  
    
  Our cost of revenues relating to corn was approximately   6%   less for our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to decreased corn consumption and average corn costs per bushel during the 2016 period.  Our average cost per bushel of corn decreased by approximately   4%   for our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to our   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Management attributes the decrease in corn costs with a strong corn harvest in the fall of 2015 along with increased corn carryover and relatively stable corn demand.  Management anticipates that corn prices will remain lower into the foreseeable future as corn is plentiful with relatively stable corn demand.  We consumed approximately   2%   fewer bushels of corn during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to improved corn to ethanol yields during the 2016 period.   
    
  Our cost of revenues related to natural gas decreased by approximately   $937,000  , a decrease of approximately   25%  , for our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .  This decrease was due to a decrease in market natural gas prices during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   along with a decrease in our natural gas usage during the 2016 period.  Our average cost per MMBtu of natural gas during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   24%   lower compared to the price for our   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Management attributes this decrease in our average natural gas costs with generally lower energy prices and ample supplies of natural gas in the market.  We used approximately   1%   fewer MMBtus of natural gas during our   nine months ended September

     Table of Contents  

30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to energy efficiency improvements in the plant and we have produced more modified/wet distillers grains which decreases the amount of natural gas we consume in our production facility.  
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  Our operating expenses were more for our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to insurance claim proceeds we received during 2015 that reduced the operating expenses for that period.  
    
  Other Income and Expense    
    
  Our interest income was less for our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to having less cash on hand during the 2016 period.  We received a business interruption insurance payment during the 2015 period which we included in our other income related to storm damage at the plant.  Our income related to our investments was less during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to reduced profitability in the ethanol industry which impacts our portion of the net income generated by our investments, including Guardian Hankinson, LLC and RPMG, because both are involved in the ethanol industry.  Our interest expense was lower during our   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to having less borrowings outstanding on our loans during the 2016 period.   
    
  Changes in Financial Condition for the   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016 
    
  Current Assets 
    
  We had less cash on hand at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   due to cash we used during the year for our capital expenditures and distributions to our members.  We had more accounts receivable at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   due to the timing of payments from our marketers at the end of each period.  We had less other receivables at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   due to payment of insurance claim receivables received in the first quarter of 2016.  The value of our inventory was lower at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   due to less corn inventory on hand.  We also had less finished goods inventory as a result of the timing of our ethanol shipments in relation to the end of our fiscal quarter.  Due to volatility in the corn market, we had a larger unrealized gain on our derivative instruments at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   which increased our current assets.  
    
  Property and Equipment 
    
  The value of our property and equipment was greater at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   as a result of capital improvements we made during our 2016 fiscal year, partially offset by regular depreciation of our equipment.  We are in the process of completing railroad track improvements which have been placed into service.  
    
  Other Assets 
    
  The value of our investments were lower at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   primarily due to a reduction in the value of our investment in Guardian Hankinson, LLC, Renewable Products Marketing Group, LLC and Lawrenceville Tank, LLC as a result of distributions we received from these investments during our 2016 fiscal year, offset by income generated by our investments since that time.     
    
  Current Liabilities 
    
  We had more outstanding checks in excess of bank balances at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   due to the timing of transfers between our accounts and increased corn payments following the end of our 2015 fiscal year.  We use our revolving loan to pay any checks which are presented for payment which exceed the cash we have available in our accounts.  Our accounts payable was significantly lower at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   because our corn suppliers typically seek to defer payments for corn that is delivered at the end of the year for tax purposes, which increases our accounts payable at that time.  These deferred payments were made early in our first quarter of 2016.  We had a greater liability associated with our derivative financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   due to having more unrealized losses on our forward corn purchase contracts at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   due to market volatility.     
    
  Long-Term Liabilities 
    
  Our long-term liabilities were less at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   due to the other liability related to long-term pledges payable.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our main sources of liquidity are cash generated from our continuing operations and amounts we have available to draw on our revolving lines of credit.  Management does not anticipate that we will need to raise additional debt or equity financing in the next twelve months and management believes that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to continue our operations during that time period.  
    
  Currently, we have two revolving loans which allow us to borrow funds for working capital.  These two revolving loans are described in greater detail below in the section entitled "  Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Indebtedness  ."  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1,000   outstanding and   $15,023,000   available to be drawn on these revolving loans, after taking into account the borrowing base calculation.  Management anticipates that this is sufficient to maintain our liquidity and continue our operations. 
    
  The following table shows cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Cash Flow From Operations  .    Our operating activities provided less cash during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , primarily due to decreased net income and a decrease in the distributions we received from our investments during the 2016 period. 
    
    Cash Flow From Investing Activities  .    Our investing activities used less cash during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to less capital expenditures during the 2016 period. 
    
  Cash Flow From Financing Activities  .   Our financing activities used more cash during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   because of a smaller increase in our checks issued in excess of bank balances partially offset by a smaller distribution during the 2016 period. 
    
  Indebtedness 
    
  Effective May 15, 2013, we entered into a comprehensive credit facility with Farm Credit Services of America, PCA and Farm Credit Services of America, FLCA (collectively "FCSA"). Our FCSA credit facility replaced our prior loans with First National Bank of Omaha. Our FCSA credit facility was originally comprised of a $10 million revolving operating line of credit (the "Operating Line") and a $5 million revolving term commitment (the "Term Revolver"). Our FCSA credit facility was amended in December 2013 to add an additional $10 million term loan (the "Term Loan"). We amended our FCSA loans on November 11, 2014, the primary purpose of which was to replace our $5 million Term Revolver and our $10 million Term Loan with a new $15 million reducing revolving loan (the "Reducing Revolving Loan").  All of our assets, including the ethanol plant and equipment, its accounts receivable and inventory, serve as collateral for our loans with FCSA. 
    
  Operating Line 
    
  The Operating Line's term was extended in our October 28, 2016 amendment to November 1, 2018.  The total amount that we can draw on the Operating Line is restricted by a formula based on the amount of inventory, receivables and equity we have in certain CBOT futures positions. Interest on the Operating Line accrued at the one month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 300 basis points. There is a fee of 0.25% on the portion of the Operating Line that we are not using, which is billed quarterly.  The interest rate for this loan at   September 30, 2016   was   3.50%  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $0   outstanding on the Operating Line and   $2,274,000   available to be drawn, taking into account the borrowing base calculation.   
    
  Reducing Revolving Loan 
    
    On November 11, 2014, we executed a loan amendment with FCSA which eliminated our prior Term Loan and Term Revolver and replaced them with a new $15 million Reducing Revolving Loan. Interest accrues on the Reducing Revolving Loan at a rate of 325 basis points in excess of the one-month LIBOR and we agreed to pay a fee of 0.50% for any unused amount of  
  
    22 

     Table of Contents  

the Reducing Revolving Loan. The amount we can borrow on the Reducing Revolving Loan decreases by $750,000 semi-annually starting on April 1, 2015 until the maximum balance reaches $7.5 million on October 1, 2019. The Reducing Revolving Loan matures on October 1, 2024. The interest rate for this loan at   September 30, 2016   was   3.75%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1,000   outstanding on the Reducing Revolving Loan and   $12,749,000   available to be drawn. 
    
  Covenants 
    
  Our credit facilities with FCSA are subject to various loan covenants. If we fail to comply with these loan covenants, FCSA can declare us to be in default of our loans. The material loan covenants applicable to our credit facilities are our working capital covenant, local net worth covenant and our debt service coverage ratio. We are required to maintain working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of at least $6 million.   We are required to maintain local net worth (total assets minus total liabilities minus the value of certain investments) of at least $18 million. We are required to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of our loan covenants.  Management's current financial projections indicate that we will be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months and we expect to remain in compliance thereafter. Management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that we will fall out of compliance with our material loan covenants in the next 12 months. If we fail to comply with the terms of our credit agreements with FCSA, and FCSA refuses to waive the non-compliance, FCSA may require us to immediately repay all amounts outstanding on our loans. 
    
  Application of Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses.  Of the significant accounting policies described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following are the most critical: 
    
  Derivative Instruments 
    
  We enter into short-term forward grain, option and futures contracts as a means of securing corn and natural gas for the ethanol plant and managing exposure to changes in commodity and energy prices.  We enter into short-term forward, option and futures contracts for sales of ethanol to manage exposure to changes in energy prices.  All of our derivatives are designated as non-hedge derivatives, and accordingly are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Although the contracts are considered economic hedges of specified risks, they are not designated as and accounted for as hedging instruments.  
    
  As part of our trading activity, we use futures and option contracts offered through regulated commodity exchanges to reduce our risk and we are exposed to risk of loss in the market value of inventories. To reduce that risk, we generally take positions using cash and futures contracts and options. 
    
  Unrealized gains and losses related to derivative contracts for corn and natural gas purchases are included as a component of cost of revenues and derivative contracts related to ethanol sales are included as a component of revenues in the accompanying financial statements.  The fair values of derivative contracts are presented on the accompanying balance sheet as derivative financial instruments. 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  We record as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Annually, as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred, the Company performs an impairment test on goodwill. The first step tests for impairment, while the second step, if necessary, measures the impairment. We perform our annual analysis on December 31 of each fiscal year.  
    
  Inventory Valuation 
    
  Inventories are generally valued using methods which approximate the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value.  In the valuation of inventories and purchase commitments, net realizable value is based on estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. 

23 

     Table of Contents  

Revenue Recognition 
    
  Revenue from the production of ethanol and related products is recorded when title transfers to customers. Generally, ethanol and related products are shipped FOB shipping point, based on written contract terms between Dakota Ethanol and its customers.  Collectability of revenue is reasonably assured based on historical evidence of collectability between Dakota Ethanol and its customers.  Interest income is recognized as earned. 
    
  Shipping costs incurred by the Company in the sale of ethanol, dried distiller's grains and corn oil are not specifically identifiable and as a result, revenue from the sale of those products is recorded based on the net selling price reported to the Company from the marketer. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
    
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations associated with commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below.  We have no exposure to foreign currency risk as all of our business is conducted in U.S. Dollars. We have loans that are subject to variable interest rates.  We use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk. We use cash, futures and option contracts to hedge changes to the commodity prices of corn and natural gas. We do not enter into these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we designate these contracts as hedges for accounting purposes. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. Exposure to interest rate risk results primarily from holding loans which bear variable interest rates. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1,000   outstanding on our variable interest rate loans with interest accruing at a rate of   3.75%  . Our variable interest rates are calculated by adding a set basis to LIBOR. If we were to experience a 10% increase in LIBOR, the annual effect such change would have on our income statement, based on the amount we had outstanding on our variable interest rate loans as of   September 30, 2016  , would be less than $1. 
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  We are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices.  Exposure to commodity price risk results from our dependence on corn and natural gas in the ethanol production process.  We seek to minimize the risks from fluctuations in the prices of corn and natural gas through the use of hedging instruments.  In practice, as markets move, we actively manage our risk and adjust hedging strategies as appropriate.  Although we believe our hedge positions accomplish an economic hedge against our future purchases, they are not designated as such for hedge accounting purposes, which would match the gain or loss on our hedge positions to the specific commodity purchase being hedged.  We are marking to market our hedge positions, which means as the current market price of our hedge positions changes, the gains and losses are immediately recognized in our cost of revenues. 
    
  The immediate recognition of hedging gains and losses can cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the cost and use of the commodity being hedged.  We recorded a combined decrease to our cost of revenues of approximately $529,000 related to derivative instruments for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  We recorded a combined decrease to our cost of revenues of approximately $242,000 related to derivative instruments for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  There are several variables that could affect the extent to which our derivative instruments are impacted by price fluctuations in the cost of corn or natural gas.  However, it is likely that commodity cash prices will have the greatest impact on the derivatives instruments with delivery dates nearest the current cash price.   
     
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were committed to purchasing approximately 3.9 million bushels of corn with an average price of $3.43 per bushel.  These corn purchases represent approximately 20% of our expected corn usage for the next 12 months.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no purchase commitments related to natural gas.  As corn and natural gas prices move in reaction to market trends and information, our income statement will be affected depending on the impact such market movements have on the value of our derivative instruments.  Depending on market movements, crop prospects and weather, these price protection positions may cause immediate adverse effects to our financial results, but are designed to produce long-term positive growth for us.

     Table of Contents  

A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate our exposure to corn, natural gas and ethanol price risk. Market risk related to these factors is estimated as the potential change in income resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the average cost of our corn and natural gas prices and average ethanol price as of   September 30, 2016  , net of the forward and future contracts used to hedge our market risk for corn and natural gas usage requirements. The volumes are based on our expected use and sale of these commodities for a one year period from   September 30, 2016  .  The results of this analysis, which may differ from actual results, are as follows: 

For comparison purposes, our sensitivity analysis for our third quarter of 2015 is set forth below.  

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   
    
  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer), Scott Mundt, along with our Chief Financial Officer (the principal financial officer), Rob Buchholtz, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  .  Based on this review and evaluation, these officers believe that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information related to us is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required by the forms and rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.       
    
  For the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II.    OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
    
  From time to time in the ordinary course of business, Dakota Ethanol or Lake Area Corn Processors may be named as a defendant in legal proceedings related to various issues, including, worker's compensation claims, tort claims, or contractual disputes.  We are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings, directly or indirectly, and we are not aware of any claims pending or threatened against us or any of the managers that could result in the commencement of material legal proceedings.   

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
    
  The following risk factor is provided due to material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K. The risk factor set forth below should be read in conjunction with the risk factors section and the Management's Discussion and Analysis section for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , included in our annual report on Form 10-K. 
    
    Distillers grains demand and prices may be negatively impacted by the Chinese anti-dumping duty  . China is the world's largest importer of distillers grains produced in the United States. On January 12, 2016, the Chinese government announced that it would commence an anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation related to distillers grains imported from the United  
  
    25 

     Table of Contents  

States. On September 23, 2016, the Chinese instituted a preliminary anti-dumping duty of 33.8% in response to this investigation.  Both during the investigation and after the announcement of the duty, distillers grains demand and prices have been negatively impacted.  While we expect China to continue to import some distillers grains, we do not anticipate that the imports will be at the same level as previous years which could continue to negatively impact market distillers grains demand and prices.  This potential reduction in demand along with lower domestic corn prices could negatively impact our ability to profitably operate the ethanol plant.

 EXHIBIT 10.1 FOURTH AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT

Exhibit 

Form 6342 (10-2015) 
  FOURTH AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT 
  This Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement ( Amendment ) is made and entered into effective the 28th day of October, 2016, by and between   Dakota Ethanol, L.L.C., a South Dakota limited liability company   (hereinafter referred to as  Borrower ) and   Farm Credit Services of America, FLCA and Farm Credit Services of America, PCA,   (hereinafter referred to as  Lender ) to amend and modify the Credit Agreement dated May 15, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement and underlying Loan Documents are modified only to the extent necessary to give effect to the terms of this Amendment, and the remaining terms of said Loan Documents, not otherwise inconsistent herewith, are ratified by the parties. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein have the respective meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement. 
  In consideration of the mutual agreements, provisions and covenants herein contained, and furthermore to induce Lender to consider financial accommodations for the Borrower under the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement, the parties hereby agree as follows: 
    
  1.  Exhibit  C  (Borrowing Base) is hereby replaced by the new Exhibit  C  attached hereto. 
    
  2.  The following Sections are hereby revised and amended, to read: 
  Section 2.1.1   Loan Facility A (304761-69993)  .   Lender agrees to advance sums to Borrower up to the aggregate amount of $10,000,000.00 (Maximum Principal Balance) until November 1, 2018 (Final Advancement Date). Each Advance made will reduce the funds available for future advances by the amount of the Advance. Repayments of principal will be available for subsequent Advances. The commitment under said Loan will be used by Borrower to finance its working capital and operating needs. Borrower agrees not to request or use such proceeds for any other purpose. 
    
  (a)  Interest  .   Borrower hereby promises to pay interest on the principal indebtedness outstanding from time to time on each Advance from and including the date of such Advance and otherwise in accordance with statements issued by Lender. Interest shall be payable on the following dates, provided that interest accruing at the Default Rate, if applicable, shall be payable on demand. 
  Said interest shall be payable on the 1st day of each month continuing on November 1, 2016 at the following rate. 
  Interest shall accrue from the date of each Advance at a variable rate per annum equivalent to the One Month LIBOR Rate, plus 3.00%. The interest rate will continue to adjust higher or lower on November 15, 2016, and on the 15th of every month thereafter to reflect any change in the One Month LIBOR Rate and this higher or lower rate will thereafter apply to the outstanding principal indebtedness and remain in effect until a different rate of interest is established. The amount of any subsequent payments will be increased or decreased accordingly to reflect the different rate of interest without in any manner changing the due date of the payments. There is no limitation on the amount of the change in the interest rate. 
  The One Month LIBOR Rate is the London InterBank Offered Rate based on the LIBOR rate published on the last Business Day of the month in the 'Money Rates' column of the Wall Street Journal, rounded to the nearest 0.05%, defined therein as 'the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration Ltd. (or any successor administrator) average of interbank offered rates for dollar deposits in the London market.' If this index is no longer available, the Lender will select a new index which is based upon comparable information. 
    
  (b)  Principal  .   Borrower hereby promises to pay principal, plus all accrued interest and any unpaid fees, costs or expenses in full on November 1, 2018 ('Maturity Date'). 
  Section 2.5.2   Mandatory Prepayments  .   If, at any time, the outstanding unpaid principal amount on any Loan shall exceed the Maximum Principal Balance on said Loan or the Minimum Borrowing Base Margin is not maintained (as that term may be defined in this Agreement), Borrower shall immediately repay Advances in an amount sufficient to reduce the outstanding unpaid principal to the Maximum Principal Balance or an amount sufficient to restore the Minimum Borrowing Base Margin (if this Agreement provides for a Borrowing Base Report with respect to said Loan). 

Form 6342 (10-2015) 
  Section 4.1   Collateral  .   As security for the payment and performance of all Obligations, Borrower hereby grants to Lender a security interest in certain personal property and a lien on certain real estate, including the following described property whether now owned or hereafter acquired wherever located in which Borrower has or claims an interest, and in all increases, additions, accessions and substitutions ( Collateral ): 
  Section 4.1.1   Goods and Equipment  .   All goods, equipment, titled and nontitled vehicles, rolling stock, machinery, inventory, parts, tools, furniture and fixtures (including any accessions, additions, improvements, attachments and accessories thereto, and all operating manuals, service records, maintenance logs and warranties applicable thereto). 
  Section 4.1.2   Farm Products  .   All farm products including, but not limited to, all poultry and livestock, together with all issue, products, replacements, and produce thereof; all feed, hay, grain, medicines, and supplies used or produced in connection therewith; and all contracts, leases, licenses, permits and privileges for water, pasture, or grazing purposes, all crops now growing or hereafter planted or grown, whether harvested, unharvested or stored; all products of crops and all seed, fertilizer, chemicals and supplies used or produced in connection with any crop, and all other supplies used or produced in Borrower's operations or sold as inventory, and the rights to payments associated with all or any of the foregoing including without limitation crop insurance or other insurance policies and proceeds related to any of the foregoing. 
  Section 4.1.3   Inventory and Goods  .   All inventory, work in process and other goods owned by Borrower, and any inventory consigned to or by any Borrower, with any third party of any nature. 
  Section 4.1.4   Accounts, General Intangibles, and Other Rights to Payment  .   All accounts, receivables, promissory notes, deposit accounts, margin accounts, commodity accounts, hedging accounts, contract rights, general intangibles (including, without limitation, patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property), payment intangibles, letters of credit, letter of credit rights and supporting obligations, chattel paper, investment property, documents, instruments, insurance proceeds, money, all government subsidies, tax refunds and other government payments or rights thereto and all other rights to payment now existing and hereafter acquired, from any and all sources. 
  Section 4.1.5   Books and Records  .   All books, records, ledger sheets or cards, reports, invoices, purchase orders, customer lists, mailing lists, files, correspondence, computer programs, tapes, disks and other documents or data processing software that at any time relates to any of the foregoing or are otherwise necessary or helpful in realizing on or collecting on any Collateral (the 'Books and Records'). 
  Section 4.1.6   Investment Property/Hedging Accounts  .   All investment property, securities, commodity contracts, securities accounts, hedging accounts, commodity accounts, all commodity and securities entitlements and other rights contained in any such account. 
  Section 4.1.7   Fixtures/Irrigation Equipment/Construction Materials  .   All construction materials, fixtures and irrigation equipment including, without limitation, all silos, bins, removable structures, tanks, wells, pumps, motors, sprinkler systems and sprinkler heads, gear heads, pipe, and generators located on the real estate described in the mortgage(s) or deed(s) of trust pledged by mortgagor(s) or trustor(s), as therein defined, and as recorded in Lake County in the state of South Dakota. 
  Section 4.1.8   Real Estate Description (Fixtures and Irrigation Equipment  :   The above fixtures, irrigation equipment and construction materials are or will be located on the real estate described in the mortgage(s) or deed(s) of trust pledged by Dakota Ethanol, L.L.C., as therein defined, and as recorded in Lake County in the state of South Dakota 
  Section 4.1.9   Products and Proceeds  .   All products and proceeds of any of the above. 
  Collateral for the Loan includes any security interest or other lien on property granted to Lender under the terms of any Collateral Agreements executed by Borrower. Said security interest or other lien is continuing and shall include the proceeds and products of the Collateral, including, but not limited to, the proceeds of any insurance thereon. 

Form 6342 (10-2015) 
    
  Borrower further agrees that if Collateral includes titled vehicles, Borrower grants Lender a power of attorney (which is coupled with an interest) to execute and file applications for certificates of title or similar documents, as Borrower s agent and attorney-in-fact, all in such form and substance as Lender may determine. 
    
  Borrower agrees to execute and deliver security agreements and assignments of accounts / control agreements in form and substance satisfactory to Lender to grant Lender a first priority perfected security interest therein, with respect to any accounts that constitute Collateral. Lender agrees that it will not exert control over Borrowers' commodity accounts, as permitted by the terms of any security agreements and assignments of accounts and control agreements, unless an Event of Default exists or except to the extent Lender reasonably deems it necessary to take action to protect the Collateral. 
    
  Section 6.12   Borrowing Base  .   Borrower agrees to maintain a minimum Borrowing Base Margin in an amount equal to or greater than $0 ('Minimum Borrowing Base Margin'). Borrowing Base Margin shall mean the difference yielded after deducting the Borrowing Base Liabilities from the Borrowing Value of certain secured assets identified as Borrowing Base Assets included in and computed according to a Borrowing Base Report acceptable to Lender, an example of which is attached hereto as Exhibit C (Borrowing Base Report). 
    
  Borrower agrees to provide Lender with such Borrowing Base Report monthly (Reporting Period), or more often at the discretion of Lender, during the term of the Loan(s), commencing October 31, 2016. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower will not be required to provide Lender a Borrowing Base Report for any December Reporting Period if there is no outstanding balance on Loan Facility A on the Report Date of that December Reporting Period. Said Borrowing Base Report shall be dated the last day of the Reporting Period (Report Date) and reflect true and accurate inventory and calculation of: Borrowing Base Assets; Borrowing Value; Borrowing Base Liabilities; and Borrowing Base Margin current through the end of the Reporting Period. Said Borrowing Base Report shall be completed by Borrower and provided to Lender no later than the 30th day following the Report Date, by ordinary mail or electronic transmission. No item shall be included in the Borrowing Base Report if such item is subject to any Lien, claim or security interest (other than that granted to Lender). Lender shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to adjust any values set forth in the Borrowing Base Report and such adjusted values will be the values for the determination of the Borrowing Base Margin. 
    
  Borrowing Base Assets shall mean those secured assets meeting the criteria to be listed as Borrowing Base Assets in the Borrowing Base Report. 
    
  Borrowing Value shall mean the total lending value based upon the designated advance rates of those assets listed as Borrowing Base Assets in the Borrowing Base Report. 
    
  Borrowing Base Liabilities shall mean the total of those liabilities listed as Borrowing Base Liabilities in the Borrowing Base Report. 
    
  If the Borrowing Base Margin is less than the Minimum Borrowing Base Margin for any Reporting Period, Borrower agrees to restore compliance with the Borrowing Base Margin within 30 days from the Report Date and that during said restoration period Lender may advance credit to Borrower as Lender may deem reasonable to protect its collateral. It is agreed that if Borrower cannot, or will not, reduce the total Borrowing Base Liabilities to an amount sufficient to restore compliance with the Minimum Borrowing Base Margin within said restoration period, Lender may deem said failure to be a material breach of this Agreement and an Event of Default. 
    
  Collateral for the Loan includes any security interest or other lien on property granted to Lender under the terms of any Collateral Agreements executed by Borrower. Said security interest or other lien is continuing and shall include the proceeds and products of the Collateral, including, but not limited to, the proceeds of any insurance thereon. 
    
  Borrower further agrees that if Collateral includes titled vehicles, Borrower grants Lender a power of attorney (which is coupled with an interest) to execute and file applications for certificates of title or similar documents, as Borrower s agent and attorney-in-fact, all in such form and substance as Lender may determine. 
  Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Lender that, after giving effect to this Amendment, (  i  ) no Default or Event of Default exists under the Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and (  ii  ) the representations and warranties set forth in the Credit Agreement are true and correct in all material respects as of the date hereof (except for those which expressly relate to an earlier date). 

Form 6342 (10-2015) 
  Borrower hereby ratifies the Credit Agreement as amended and acknowledges and reaffirms (  i  ) that it is bound by all terms of the Credit Agreement applicable to it and (  ii  ) that it is responsible for the observance and full performance of its respective obligations. 
  Borrower hereby certifies that the person(s) executing this Amendment on behalf of Borrower is/are duly authorized to execute such document on behalf of Borrower and that there have been no changes in the name, ownership, control, organizational documents, or legal status of the Borrower since the last application, loan, or loan servicing action; that all resolutions, powers and authorities remain in full force and effect, and that the information provided by Borrower is and remains true and correct. 
  This Amendment may be executed by the parties hereto in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of executed counterparts of this Amendment by telecopy shall be effective as an original and shall constitute a representation that an original shall be delivered. 
  THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT MADE UNDER AND GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA. A CREDIT AGREEMENT MUST BE IN WRITING TO BE ENFORCEABLE UNDER NEBRASKA LAW. TO PROTECT YOU AND US FROM ANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS OR DISAPPOINTMENTS, ANY CONTRACT, PROMISE, UNDERTAKING OR OFFER TO FOREBEAR REPAYMENT OF MONEY OR TO MAKE ANY OTHER FINANCIAL ACCOMMODATION IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AMENDMENT MUST BE IN WRITING TO BE EFFECTIVE. 
  This Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have set their hand effective the day and year first above written.
