Notes
to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited)   

NOTE
1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The
condensed balance sheet of Thunderclap Entertainment, Inc. (the  Company ) as of September 30, 2016, and the condensed
statements of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, have not been audited.
However, in the opinion of management, such information includes all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments),
which are necessary to properly reflect the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016, and the results of operations
for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  

Certain
information and notes normally included in condensed financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted, although management believes that the disclosures are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be achieved for an entire year. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and notes to financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and calendar year then ended.  

NOTE
2 - NATURE OF BUSINESS   

The
Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of California on September 10, 2009, under the name Thunderclap Entertainment,
Inc. The Company has limited operations and is developing a business plan as a producer of low-budget motion pictures. To date,
its business activities have been limited to organizational matters, research of film scripts and raising capital. It is considered
a development stage company and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations.  

NOTE
3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements as of and for the six months ended September 30, 2016 have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( generally accepted
accounting principles ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. The accompanying unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s 2015
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 24, 2016.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The
Company does not have any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

Thunderclap
Entertainment, Inc.   

Income
Taxes   

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10,  Accounting for
Income Taxes.  Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for
the current year; and, (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized
in an entity s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period
that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the
weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.  

ASC
740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected
to be taken may be recognized only if it is  more likely than not  that the position is sustainable upon examination,
based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge
of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties, if applicable) is established to the extent a
current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain
tax position. Related interest and penalties, if any, are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.  

As
of January 1, 2009, we have analyzed filing positions in each of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to
file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. We have identified the U.S. federal and California
as our  major  tax jurisdictions. Generally, we remain subject to Internal Revenue Service examination of our 2009
through 2015 California Franchise Tax Returns. However, we have certain tax attribute carry forwards, which will remain subject
to review and adjustment by the relevant tax authorities until the statute of limitations closes with respect to the year in which
such attributes are utilized.  

We
believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that
will result in a material change to our financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax position have been
recorded pursuant to ASC 740. In addition, we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of ASC 740.
Related interest and penalties, if any, are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.  

Loss
per Share   

The
Company s basic income or loss per share is calculated by dividing its net income or loss available to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company s dilutive income or loss per share
is calculated by dividing its net income or loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares
adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company s financial instruments as defined by FASB ASC 825,   Financial Instruments   include cash, trade
accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses. All instruments are accounted for on a historical cost basis,
which, due to the short maturity of these financial instruments, approximates fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015.  

Thunderclap
Entertainment, Inc.   

FASB
ASC 820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;   

Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets,
    that are observable either directly or indirectly; and   

Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no
    market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.   

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

We
have adopted all recently issued accounting pronouncements. The adoption of the accounting pronouncements is not anticipated to
have a material effect on our operations.  

NOTE
4 STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT   

The
Company was formed with one class of common stock, no par value and is authorized to issue 50,000,000 common shares and no preferred
shares. Voting rights are not cumulative and, therefore, the holders of more than 50% of the common stock could, if they chose
to do so, elect all of the directors of the Company.  

In
September 2009, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock to its officer and sole director, Gary L. Blum. The Company
issued this stock to Mr. Blum in exchange for $100 of services rendered to the Company in its formation at a price of $0.0001
per share. In addition, the Company issued 250,000 shares of common stock to its president, Michael F. Matondi, in exchange for
$25 of services rendered in its formation at a price of $0.0001 per share.  

In
September 2009, the Company issued 13,000,000 common shares to Donald P. Hateley, its founder and legal counsel, for services
rendered in its formation and organization valued at $1,300 or $0.0001 per share and 500,000 common shares to Alena V. Borisova
for services rendered in its formation and organization valued at $500 or $0.0001 per share and 250,000 common shares to Sherry
Goggin for services rendered in its formation and organization valued at $250 or $0.0001 per share.  

From
September 29, 2009 to December 31, 2009, the Company issued 705,000 shares at a price of $0.10 per share for $70,500 to individuals
in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Act )
in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Act.  

From
January 1, 2010 to April 9, 2010, the Company issued 780,000 common shares at a price of $0.10 per share for $78,000 to individuals
in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Act in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Act.  

As
of September 30, 2016, there are 16,485,000 shares of common stock outstanding.  

NOTE
5 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

The
sole officer and director of the Company is involved in other business activities and may, in the future, become involved in other
business opportunities. If a specific business opportunity becomes available, he may face a conflict in selecting between the
Company and his other business interests. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts.  

Thunderclap
Entertainment, Inc.   

The
Company s majority shareholder is its legal counsel. In April 2011, a shareholder advanced the Company $12,000 to fund working
capital expenses. This advance is unsecured and does not carry an interest rate or repayment terms; however, the shareholder has
orally agreed not to seek repayment until the Company is financially able to repay it. From May 2011 to December 2015, our majority
shareholder advanced $42,848 to fund working capital expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, this
shareholder advanced $5,649 and $5,740, respectively. These advances are unsecured and do not carry an interest rate or repayment
terms; however, the shareholder has agreed not to seek repayment until the Company is financially able to repay it.  

The
Company does not own any property. It previously leased an office from a third party at 201 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 300, Santa
Monica, California 90401-2224. Its principal shareholder and legal counsel also use this location. Commencing April 1, 2011, the
Company s legal counsel provides it with office space, on a month-to-month basis, for no charge. The estimated cost of the
space he provides is $100 per month. Its executive officer, Gary L. Blum, also works from this location and also maintains an
office in Los Angeles, CA. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded rent expense of $300,
respectively.  

NOTE
6 GOING CONCERN   

The
Company s financial statements are prepared using GAAP, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of
liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established a source of revenues to cover its operating
costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the
Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate
capital, it could be forced to cease operations.  

Management
intends to focus on raising additional funds for the first and second quarters going forward. We cannot provide any assurance
or guarantee that we will be able to generate revenues. Potential investors must be aware if we are unable to raise additional
funds through the sale of our common stock and generate sufficient revenues, any investment made into the Company would be lost
in its entirety.  

The
Company has accumulated deficit as of to September 30, 2016 of $219,993. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure
other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
7   COMMITMENT   

The
Company does not own any property. It previously leased an office from a third party at 201 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 300, Santa

2015, respectively.

Forward
Looking Statements   

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations  in Item 2 of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (collectively, the  Reform
Act ). The Reform Act provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective
information about themselves so long as they identify these statements as forward-looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements
identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results. All statements, other than
statements of historical fact that we make in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking. The words  anticipates, 
 believes,   expects,   intends,   will continue,   estimates,   plans, 
 projects,  the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
However, the absence of these words does not mean the statement is not forward-looking.  

Forward-looking
statements involve risks, uncertainties or other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from the future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our management s
beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Certain risks, uncertainties or other important
factors are detailed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and may be detailed from time to time in other reports we file with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, including on Forms 8-K and 10-K.  

Examples
of forward looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, our expectations regarding
our ability to generate operating cash flows and to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Important assumptions
relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our future products, the timing
and cost of capital expenditures, competitive conditions and general economic conditions. These assumptions could prove inaccurate.
Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations
may prove to be incorrect. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results and events
anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements include:  

the
    risks of a development stage company;   

management s
    plans, objectives and budgets for its future operations and future economic performance;   

capital
    budget and future capital requirements;   

meeting
    future capital needs;   

our
    dependence on management and the need to recruit additional personnel;   

limited
    trading for our common stock, if listed or quoted   

the
    level of future expenditures;   

impact
    of recent accounting pronouncements;   

the
    outcome of regulatory and litigation matters; and   

the
    assumptions described in this report underlying such forward-looking statements. Actual results and developments may materially
    differ from those expressed in or implied by such statements due to a number of factors, including:   

those
    described in the context of such forward-looking statements;   

future
    product development and marketing costs;   

timely
    development and acceptance of our film or television projects;   

the
    markets of our domestic operations;   

the
    impact of competitive products and pricing;   

the
    political, social and economic climate in which we conduct operations; and   

the
    risk factors described in other documents and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Registration
    Statement on Form S-1/A (SEC File No. 333-172658).   

We
operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for us
to predict all of those risks, nor can we assess the impact of all of those risks on our business or the extent to which any factor
may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. We believe these forward-looking
statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on
current expectations. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and unless required by law,
we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations  

The
following is management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and is provided as a
supplement to the accompanying unaudited financial statements and notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows during the periods included in the accompanying unaudited financial statements.  

In
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,  Company,   the Company,   us,  and  our 
refer to Thunderclap Entertainment, Inc., a California corporation, unless the context requires otherwise.  

We
intend the following discussion to assist in the understanding of our financial position and our results of operations for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015. You should refer to the Financial Statements and related Notes in conjunction with this discussion.  

Results
of Operations  

General   

We
were incorporated under the laws of the State of California on June 10, 2009 with fiscal year end in December 31. We are a development
stage enterprise that seeks to become an independent film production company, to develop and produce low-budget, independent feature
films under $2,000,000. Since beginning operations in June 2009, we have not developed or produced any films and we have accumulated
losses in the amount of $218,597 as of June 30, 2016. We have never been party to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding,
nor have we undergone any material reclassification, merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets
not in the ordinary course of business.  

We
have yet to commence planned operations to any significant measure. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have
had only limited operations and have not generated any revenues. We will not be profitable until we derive sufficient revenues
and cash flows from the development, production and sale of film projects. Our chief executive officer and sole director, Gary
L. Blum, and our president, Michael F. Matondi, III, are our only employees. Mr. Blum and Mr. Matondi will devote at least ten
hours per week to us but may increase the number of hours as necessary.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had $154 cash on hand and in the bank. Management does not believe this amount will satisfy our cash
requirements for the next three months. We plan to satisfy our future cash requirements - primarily the working capital required
for operations by loans from our shareholders or additional equity financing. The additional equity financings will likely be
in the form of private placements of common stock. As of September 30, 2016, the Company borrowed $60,497 from two of our shareholders.  

Management
believes that if subsequent private placements are successful, we will generate sales revenue within the following twelve months
thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail
to satisfy our future cash requirements.  

If
we are unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering, we will then have to seek additional
funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company with nominal assets to secure.
Therefore, we are highly dependent upon the success of a future private placement offering and failure thereof would result in
our having to seek capital from other resources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to us. However, if such
financing were available, because we are a development stage company with no operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional
costs associated with high-risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required,
management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth
and manage the debt load. If we cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of our common stock or secure debt financing
we would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors in our common stock would lose all of their investment.  

We
have no current plans, preliminary or otherwise, to merge with any other entity although we may consider such plans in the future.
We are in discussions with a number of producers to acquire their completed films for distribution.  

At
the present time, we are negotiating with various investors to obtain additional equity financing. There can be no assurance that
we will be successful in obtaining additional capital from these negotiations. If are unable to raise additional capital, we will
either suspend marketing operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Other than as described in this
paragraph and the preceding paragraphs, we have no other financing plans.  

Thunderclap
Entertainment, Inc.  

Management
does not plan to hire additional employees at this time. Our officers and directors will be responsible for the initial product
and service sourcing. We have hired an independent consultant to build the site.  

Critical
Accounting Policy and Estimates.  Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
section discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including
those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases
its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the
appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. In addition, these
accounting policies are described at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to the financial statements
included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

The following discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, together with notes thereto, which are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015  

Revenues .
We had no revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Operating
expenses.  Operating expenses include general and administrative expenses, professional fees and rent expense. In total, operating
expenses increased by $56, or 4.18%, to $1,396 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,340 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The components of operating expenses are discussed below.  

Net
loss.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net loss was $1,396, an increase of $56, or 4.18%, from $1,340 for
the comparable period in 2015. The increase is attributable to operating expenses discussed above.  

Nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015  

Revenues .
We had no revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Thunderclap
Entertainment, Inc.   

Operating
expenses.  Operating expenses include general and administrative expenses, professional fees and rent expense. In total, operating
expenses increased $125, or 1.37%, to $6,518 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6,393 for the comparable
period ended September 30, 2015. The components of operating expenses are discussed below.  

Other
Income.  Other income decreased by $2,626, or 100%, to $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,626 for
the comparable period in 2015. The decrease in other income is a result of a one-time write-off of $2,626 in accounts payable
in 2015 due to a vendor forgiving the payable.  

Net
loss.  Our net loss increased $2,751, or 73.03%, to $6,518 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss
of $3,767 for the comparable period in 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to a $2,626 one-time write off of an accounts
payable balance to a vendor.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources . In 2016, we did not issue any shares for capital. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our
majority shareholder loaned us $5,649. We intend to seek additional financing for our working capital, in the form of equity or
debt, to provide us with the necessary capital to accomplish our plan of operation. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in our efforts to raise additional capital.  

Our
total assets are $154 as of September 30, 2016, consisting of $154 in cash. Our working capital deficit was $60,343 as of September
30, 2016.  

Our
total liabilities are $60,497 as of September 30, 2016, which consists of advances from shareholders of $60,497.  

Our
total stockholders  deficit is $60,343 as of September 30, 2016, and an accumulated deficit of $219,993 as of September
30, 2016.  

We
had $5,618 in net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included $6,518 in net
loss, which amount was offset by $900 in rent expense.  

We
had no cash provided by investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

We
had $5,649 in cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which is from related party
advances.  

We
do not now have funds sufficient for pursuing our plan of operation, but we are in the process of trying to procure funds sufficient
to fund our operations until we are able to finance our operations through cash flow. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to procure funds sufficient for such purpose. If operating difficulties or other factors (many of which are beyond our control)
delay our realization of revenues or cash flows from operations, we may be limited in our ability to pursue our business plan.
Moreover, if our resources from obtaining additional capital or cash flows from operations, once we commence them, do not satisfy
our operational needs or if unexpected expenses arise due to unanticipated pressures or if we decide to expand our business plan
beyond its currently anticipated level or otherwise, we will require additional financing to fund our operations, in addition
to anticipated cash generated from our operations. Additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at
all. If adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, take
advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would
be significantly limited. In a worst-case scenario, we might not be able to fund our operations or to remain in business, which
could result in a total loss of our stockholders  investment. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity
or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced, and these newly issued securities
might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders.  

The
Company had no formal long-term lines or credit or other bank financing arrangements as of September 30, 2016.  

Thunderclap
Entertainment, Inc.   

The
Company has no current plans for the purchase or sale of any plant or equipment.  

The
Company has no current plans to make any changes in the number of employees.  

Income
Tax Expense (Benefit)   

The
Company has a prospective income tax benefit resulting from a net operating loss carry forward and startup costs that may offset
any future operating profit.  

Impact
of Inflation   

The
Company believes that inflation has had a negligible effect on operations over the past quarter.  

Capital
Expenditures   

The
Company expended no amounts on capital expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015,
respectively.  

Plan
of Operation   

Our
business strategy is to continue to actively market our website ( www.thunderclapinc.com ), to writers and others to submit
treatments, screenplays and other ideas for production. We may set up a virtual data room whereby writers and others will be able
to view their submissions and the materials submitted by others. We have met with various producers and are reviewing their projects.
By the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, based on our efforts to use social media to increase our exposure, we hope to have additional
submissions of screenplays, treatments and other entertainment related projects to evaluate and intend to continue with this method
of seeking product from writers and others. We intend to use our stock as a form of payment for any submissions that we are interested
in acquiring. We intend to exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the underlying screenplay and any film derived
from it.  

The
number of screenplays to which we will be able to secure production rights during the development stage will depend upon the success
of securing financing for each project. We plan to develop at least one screenplay based on the submissions we anticipate being
uploaded to our website or from our in person meetings with other production companies. There are currently no agreements in place
between any funding sources and us for the production of any submissions. There can be no guarantee we will have enough funds
to secure the rights of any screenplay in the future. We have had numerous discussions with various producers and writers and
intend to joint venture or co-produce projects with them based on our ability to bring financing to the projects.  

We
intend to implement the following tasks within the next twelve months if we are able to obtain additional financing:  

Secure
Rights to Screenplay : (Estimated cost $10,000). We estimate it may take approximately six months to secure a screenplay based
on our evaluation and negotiations once we commence them. We will attempt to acquire any screenplay rights with the issuance of
our common stock to the writer.  

Pre-Production
Business Plan : (Estimated cost - None). Our officers and sole director will complete this without compensation. Once we complete
the above tasks, we estimate completing a pre-production business plan within 3 months. This pre-production business plan together
with the preliminary screenplay, budget, shooting schedule, production board and any talent commitment will be presented to prospective
directors, actors, investors and/or financiers by our management.  

If
we are able to successfully complete the above goals within the estimated timeframes set forth and are able to raise additional
proceeds above the minimum ($10,000) that may be needed to secure the screenplay, those funds would be allocated as follows:    

Retain
Screen Writer : (Estimated cost $10,000). After a screenplay has been secured, we estimate an additional three months thereafter
would be required to secure a screenwriter. We intend to pay for this expense from the funding source for the production.  

Completion
of Screenplay : (Estimated cost $10,000). We believe the screenplay can be finalized within three months.  

Thunderclap
Entertainment, Inc.   

Secure
Director, Actor(s) and Supporting Cast for Film Production : (Estimated cost $75,000- $125,000; this fee may be secured with
issuance of the Company s common stock   however, management cannot predict at this time if its common stock will
be attractive to secure the above personnel). We believe this can be completed within 30-45 days after the screenplay has been
written.  

The
following steps would require additional financing from a third party source or from the issuance of our common stock in the future.
We believe if we are able to complete the above goals we would be in a position to obtain additional financing to complete the
below tasks within the specified timeframe; however, there can be no guarantee or assurance that we will be successful in completing
any of the above described tasks.   

Secure
Financing : We cannot provide any estimated cost for the financing aspect of the film, as there are multiple variables to financing
the film. We anticipate that we will be in discussions regarding the financing of a film, with various potential investors and/or
participants, as soon as we identify a viable screenplay.  

Film/Production :
We plan to focus its business on the development and production of commercial feature-length motion pictures having budgets of
up to $2 million. Estimated time to complete filming and production is estimated at nine to twelve months.  

Secure
Distribution Agreements : (Estimated cost $2,500). Upon completion of the film/production process we plan to seek and secure
distribution agreements.  

Our
management does not anticipate the need to hire additional full or part-time employees over the next six (6) months, as the services
provided by our officers and director appear sufficient at this time. We believe that our operations are currently on a small
scale that is manageable by these two individuals. Our management s responsibilities are mainly administrative at this early
stage. While we believe that the addition of employees is not required over the next six (6) months, the professionals we plan
to utilize will be considered independent contractors. We do not intend to enter into any employment agreements with any of these
professionals. Thus, these persons are not intended to be employees of our Company.  

Our
management does not expect to incur research costs in the next twelve months; we currently do not own any significant plants or
equipment that we would seek to sell in the near future; we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements; and we have not paid
for expenses on behalf of our director. Additionally, we believe that this fact shall not materially change.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements  

None.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   

Our
financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (  GAAP  ). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective
interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported.
These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding
contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP
and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.  

Use
of Estimates:   

Areas
where significant estimation judgments are made and where actual results could differ materially from these estimates are the
carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources and the classification of net
operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.  

We
believe the following is among the most critical accounting policies that impact our financial statements:  

Thunderclap
Entertainment, Inc.   

We
evaluate impairment of our long-lived assets by applying the provisions of SFAS No. 144. In applying those provisions, we have
not recognized any impairment charge on our long-lived assets during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

We
suggest that our significant accounting policies, as described in our financial statements in the Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies, be read in conjunction with this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

As
a   smaller reporting company   as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information
required by this item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures  

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We
conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this quarterly report
on Form 10-Q were effective at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.  

(b) Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  

During
the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, there has been no change in internal control over financial reporting
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

INHERENT
LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS  

Our
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with the U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  

pertain
    to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of our assets;   

provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with the U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
    and directors; and   

provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets
    that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

Management
does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any
evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become
inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
