A.   ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  In our opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly our financial position as at   September 30, 2016  , and our results of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the three-month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and cash flows and changes in shareholders  equity for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The condensed consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   was derived from audited financial statements. 
    
  Reclassification.    Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the   2016   presentation in the condensed consolidated financial statements.   
    
  Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements.    We have revised the previously reported balances on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 to correct the classification for warranty claims not expected to be settled within the next year. Accrued liabilities decreased and Other liabilities increased from the amounts previously reported by   $102 million  .  This revision had no effect on our condensed consolidated statements of operations or condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.  This revision is not considered material to our prior period financial statements. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.    In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02 ( ASU 2015-02 )  Consolidation (Topic 810)   Amendments to the Consolidations Analysis,  which modifies certain aspects of both the variable interest entities and voting interest entities models. We adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016. The adoption of the new standard did not have an impact on our financial position or our results of operations. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015 03 ( ASU 2015 03 )  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835 30) - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  that requires that all costs incurred to issue debt be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 to clarify that debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements may remain classified as an asset. We retrospectively adopted both ASU 2015 03 and ASU 2015 15 on January 1, 2016. As a result of the retrospective adoption of the standards, we reclassified   $15 million   of debt issuance costs from Other assets to Long-term debt, and   $1 million   of debt issuance costs from Other assets to Notes payable, as of December 31, 2015. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard for revenue recognition, Accounting Standards Codification 606 ( ASC 606 ).  The purpose of ASC 606 is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability across industries. ASC 606 is effective for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2018.  We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our results of operations.  
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01 ( ASU 2016-01 ),  Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our financial position and results of operations. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard for leases, Accounting Standards Codification 842 ( ASC 842 ), which changes the accounting model for identifying and accounting for leases. ASC 842 is effective for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our financial position and results of operations. 
       
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ),  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which requires the tax effects related to share-based payments to be recorded through the income statement and simplifies the accounting requirements for forfeitures and employers' tax withholding requirements. ASU 2016-09 is effective for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2017. We anticipate the impact of the adoption of this ASU to be limited to the reclassification of certain items within our statement of cash flows, which we intend to adopt retrospectively.

A.   ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Concluded) 
       
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15 ( ASU 2016-15 ),  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which is intended to reduce diversity in practice as to how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  ASC 2016-15 is effective for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our statement of cash flows. 

B.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
    
  The presentation of discontinued operations includes a component or group of components that we have or intend to dispose of, and represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results.  For spin off transactions, discontinued operations treatment is appropriate following the completion of the spin off. 
    
  On September 30, 2014, we announced a plan to spin off   100 percent   of our Installation and Other Services businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company named TopBuild Corp. ( TopBuild ) through a tax-free distribution of the stock of TopBuild to our stockholders.  We initiated the spin off as TopBuild was no longer considered core to our long-term growth strategy in branded building products.  We completed the spin off on June 30, 2015 at which time we accounted for it as a discontinued operation. Losses from this discontinued operation were included in loss from discontinued operations, net, in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  The major classes of line items constituting loss from discontinued operations, net, were as follows, in millions: 

(A)    The unusual relationship between income tax expense and income before income tax for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 resulted primarily from certain non-deductible transaction costs related to the spin off of TopBuild. 
    
  Other selected financial information for TopBuild during the period owned by us was as follows, in millions:   

In conjunction with the spin off, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement with TopBuild under which we provide administrative services to TopBuild subsequent to the separation.  The fees for services rendered under the Transition Services Agreement are not material to our results of operations.

C.   GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
    
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , by segment, were as follows, in millions:  

(A)      Other principally includes the effect of foreign currency translation. 
    
  The carrying value of our other indefinite-lived intangible assets was   $136 million   and   $137 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and principally included registered trademarks. The carrying value of our definite-lived intangible assets was   $19 million   (net of accumulated amortization of   $17 million  ) and   $23 million   (net of accumulated amortization of   $49 million  ) at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and principally included customer relationships.   

D.   DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense, including discontinued operations, was   $100 million   for both of the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   

E.   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS 
    
  We have maintained investments in available-for-sale securities, equity method investments and a number of private equity funds, principally as part of our tax planning strategies, as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future tax capital losses. Financial investments were as follows, in millions:

     Table of Contents  
  MASCO CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Continued) 

E.   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS (Concluded) 
    
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements.    Our auction rate securities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and have been estimated using a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 input).  The significant inputs in the discounted cash flow model used to value the auction rate securities include: expected maturity of auction rate securities, discount rate used to determine the present value of expected cash flows and the assumptions for credit defaults, since the auction rate securities are backed by credit default swap agreements.  
    
  In the second quarter of 2016,   $10 million   of our auction rate securities were called by our counterparty and redeemed at a value that approximated our recorded basis. Our investments in auction rate securities had a recorded basis of   $12 million   and   $22 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which included cost basis of   $10 million   and   $19 million   and pre-tax unrealized gains of   $2 million   and   $3 million   at each respective date.  
    
  Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements.    During the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,  we did not measure any financial investments at fair value on a non-recurring basis, as there was no other-than-temporary decline in the estimated value of these investments. 
    
  We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets in the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
       
  Realized Gains (Losses).    Income from financial investments, net, included in other, net, within other income (expense), net, was as follows, in millions:  

Fair Value of Debt.    The fair value of our short-term and long-term fixed-rate debt instruments is based principally upon modeled market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.  The aggregate estimated market value of short-term and long-term debt at   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $3.3 billion  , compared with the aggregate carrying value of   $3.0 billion  .  The aggregate estimated market value of short-term and long-term debt at   December 31, 2015   was approximately   $3.6 billion  , compared with the aggregate carrying value of   $3.4 billion  . 

F.   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
    
  We are exposed to global market risk as part of our normal daily business activities.  To manage these risks, we enter into various derivative contracts.  These contracts include interest rate swap agreements, foreign currency contracts and metals contracts intended to hedge our exposure to copper and zinc. We review our hedging program, derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis. 
    
  Interest Rate Swap Agreements.    In 2012, in connection with the issuance of   $400 million   of debt, we terminated the interest rate swap hedge relationships that we had entered into in 2011.  These interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and effectively fixed interest rates on the forecasted debt issuance to variable rates based on 3-month LIBOR.  Upon termination, the ineffective portion of the cash flow hedges of an approximate   $2 million   loss was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations in other, net within other income (expense), net.  The remaining loss of approximately   $23 million   from the termination of these swaps is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt, through March 2022. 
    
  Foreign Currency Contracts.    Our net cash inflows and outflows exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates arise from the sale of products in countries other than the manufacturing source, foreign currency denominated supplier payments, debt and other payables, and investments in subsidiaries.  To mitigate this risk, we, including certain of our European operations, entered into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency exchange contracts.

F.   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (Concluded) 
    
  Gains (losses) related to foreign currency forward and exchange contracts are recorded in our condensed consolidated statements of operations in other, net, within other income (expense), net.  In the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of the foreign currency forward or exchange contracts, our exposure is limited to the aggregate foreign currency rate differential with such institutions. 
    
  Metals Contracts.    We have entered into several contracts to manage our exposure to increases in the price of copper and zinc.  Gains (losses) related to these contracts are recorded in our condensed consolidated statements of operations in cost of sales. 
    
  The pre-tax gains (losses) included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations are as follows, in millions: 

We present our derivatives net by counterparty, due to the right of offset under master netting arrangements, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

G.   WARRANTY LIABILITY 
    
  Changes in our warranty liability were as follows, in millions:  

During 2016, a business in the Windows and Other Specialty Products segment recorded a   $31 million   increase as a change in estimate of expected future warranty claims resulting from recent warranty claim trends, including, among other items, the nature and type of claim and estimate of costs to service claims.  

H.   DEBT 
    
  On   March 17, 2016  , we issued   $400 million   of   3.5%   Notes due April 1, 2021 and   $500 million   of   4.375%   Notes due April 1, 2026.  We received proceeds of $  896 million  , net of discount, for the issuance of these Notes. The Notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at our option at the applicable redemption price.  On April 15, 2016, proceeds from the debt issuances, together with cash on hand, were used to repay and early retire all of our   $1 billion  ,   6.125%   Notes which were due on October 3, 2016 and all of our   $300 million  ,   5.85%   Notes which were due on March 15, 2017.  In connection with these early retirements, we incurred   $40 million   of debt extinguishment costs, which we recorded as interest expense.  
  On March 28, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with a bank group, with an aggregate commitment of   $1.25 billion   and a maturity date of March 28, 2018.  On May 29, 2015 and August 28, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement with the bank group (the  Amended Credit Agreement ).  The Amended Credit Agreement reduced the aggregate commitment to   $750 million   and extends the maturity date to May 29, 2020.  Under the Amended Credit Agreement, at our request and subject to certain conditions, we can increase the aggregate commitment up to an additional   $375 million   with the current bank group or new lenders. 
    
  The Amended Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility available to us and one of our foreign subsidiaries, in U.S. dollars, European Euro and certain other currencies. Borrowings under the revolver denominated in euros are limited to   $500 million  , equivalent. We can also borrow swingline loans up to   $75 million   and obtain letters of credit of up to   $100 million  ; any outstanding letters of credit under the Amended Credit Agreement reduce our borrowing capacity. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   outstanding standby letters of credit under the Amended Credit Agreement. 
    
  Revolving credit loans bear interest under the Amended Credit Agreement, at our option, at (A) a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds effective rate plus   0.50%   and (iii) LIBOR plus   1.0%   (the  Alternative Base Rate  plus an applicable margin based upon our then-applicable corporate credit ratings; or (B) LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon our then-applicable corporate credit ratings. The foreign currency revolving credit loans bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon our then-applicable corporate credit ratings. 
    
  The Amended Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain (A) a maximum net leverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, of   4.0   to 1.0, and (B) a minimum interest coverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, equal to or greater than   2.5   to 1.0.

  In order for us to borrow under the Amended Credit Agreement, there must not be any default in our covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement (i.e., in addition to the two financial covenants, principally limitations on subsidiary debt, negative pledge restrictions, legal compliance requirements and maintenance of properties and insurance) and our representations and warranties in the Amended Credit Agreement must be true in all material respects on the date of borrowing (i.e., principally no material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a material adverse change, since December 31, 2014, in each case, no material ERISA or environmental non-compliance, and no material tax deficiency). We were in compliance with all covenants and had   no   borrowing under the Amended Credit Agreement at   September 30, 2016  .  

I.   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
    
  Our 2014 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ) provides for the issuance of stock-based incentives in various forms to our employees and non-employee Directors.  At   September 30, 2016  , outstanding stock-based incentives were in the form of long-term stock awards, stock options, phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights.  Pre-tax compensation expense and the related income tax benefit for these stock-based incentives were as follows, in millions:  

Long-Term Stock Awards.    Long-term stock awards are granted to our key employees and non-employee Directors and do not cause net share dilution provided we continue the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares in the open market.  We granted   1,050,380   shares of long-term stock awards in the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  .

(A)                      In connection with the spin off of TopBuild, TopBuild employees forfeited their outstanding Masco equity awards. 
  (B)                      Subsequent to the separation of TopBuild, we modified our outstanding equity awards to employees and non-employee Directors such that all individuals received an equivalent fair value both before and after the separation.  The modification to the outstanding stock awards was made pursuant to existing anti-dilution provisions in our 2014 Plan and 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there was   $49 million   and   $47 million  , respectively, of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards; such awards had a weighted average remaining vesting period of   three   years at both   September 30,     2016   and   2015  . 
    
  The total market value (at the vesting date) of stock award shares which vested during the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $43 million   and   $54 million  , respectively. 
    
  Stock Options.    Stock options are granted to our key employees.  The exercise price equals the market price of our common stock at the grant date.  These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over   five years   beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than   10 years   after the grant date. 
    
  We granted   474,500   of stock option shares in the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   with a grant date exercise price approximating   $26   per share. In the   nine  -month period ended   September 30,     2016  ,   no   stock option shares were forfeited (including options that expired unexercised).

(A) 
    Subsequent to the separation of TopBuild, we modified our outstanding equity awards to employees and non-employee Directors such that all individuals received an equivalent fair value both before and after the separation.  The modification to the outstanding options was made pursuant to existing anti-dilution provisions in our 2014 Plan and 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan.  The modification contributed to the lower exercise price. 
              (B) 
    Aggregate intrinsic value is calculated using our stock price at each respective date, less the exercise price (grant date price), multiplied by the number of shares.

    In connection with the spin off of TopBuild, TopBuild employees forfeited their outstanding Masco equity awards.

I.   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Concluded) 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there was   $7 million   and   $6 million  , respectively, of unrecognized compensation expense (using the Black-Scholes option pricing model at the grant date) related to unvested stock options; such options had a weighted average remaining vesting period of   three   years at   September 30, 2016   and   two   years at   September 30, 2015  .

J.   EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS 
    
  Net periodic pension cost for our defined-benefit pension plans was as follows, in millions:  

In the second quarter of 2016, we contributed   $51 million   to certain qualified defined-benefit pension plans, which was not included in our previous 2016 expected contributions.  At September 30, 2016, we now expect to contribute a total of approximately   $96 million   to our qualified defined-benefit pension plans in 2016.     
    
  We froze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and foreign and domestic non-qualified defined benefit pension plans several years ago.

L.   SEGMENT INFORMATION 
    
  Information by segment and geographic area was as follows, in millions:  

(A) 
    Inter-segment sales were not material. 
              (B) 
    In the first quarter of 2016, we renamed our Cabinetry Products and Windows and Other Specialty Products segments. The name change did not impact the review of financial information by our corporate operating executive or the composition of the segments. 

M.   SEVERANCE COSTS 
    
  We recorded charges related to severance of   $1 million   and   $5 million   for the three-month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $1 million   and   $8 million   for the three-month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.

O.   EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 
    
  Reconciliations of the numerators and denominators used in the computations of basic and diluted earnings per common share were as follows, in millions:  

For the three-month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we allocated dividends and undistributed earnings to the unvested restricted stock awards. 
    
  Additionally,   609,000   common shares for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   and   4 million   and   6 million   common shares for the three-month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, related to stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share due to their antidilutive effect. 
    
  On September 30, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   50 million   shares for retirement of our common stock in open-market transactions or otherwise, replacing the previous Board of Directors authorization established in 2007. In the first   nine   months of   2016  , we repurchased and retired   8.3 million   shares of our common stock (including   1.1 million   shares to offset the dilutive impact of long-term stock awards granted in the first half of the year), for approximately   $252 million   of which   $242 million   was paid in cash during the first   nine   months of   2016  .  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   19.4 million   shares remaining under the authorization. 
    
  On the basis of amounts paid (declared), cash dividends per common share were   $0.095   (  $0.100  ) and   $0.285   (  $0.290  ) for the three-month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $0.090   (  $0.095  ) and   $0.270   (  $0.275  ) for the three-month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  

P.   OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  We are subject to claims, charges, litigation and other proceedings in the ordinary course of our business, including those arising from or related to contractual matters, intellectual property, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, product recalls, construction defect, insurance coverage, personnel and employment disputes, anti-trust issues and other matters, including class actions.  We believe we have adequate defenses in these matters and that the likelihood that the outcome of these matters would have a material adverse effect on us is remote.  However, there is no assurance that we will prevail in these matters, and we could, in the future, incur judgments, enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of these matters, which could materially impact our results of operations.

Q.   INCOME TAXES  
    
  Our effective tax rate was   36 percent   and   35   percent for the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   39   percent and   41   percent for the three-month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The decrease in the 2016 rates results primarily from the tax benefit of the domestic production deduction which allows a deduction for certain qualified production activities within the U.S.  This deduction was not available in 2015 due to the utilization of our U.S. Federal loss carryforward.  Additionally, the decrease in the nine-month rate is impacted by an   $18 million   valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of TopBuild recorded as a non-cash charge to income tax expense in the second quarter of 2015.  The TopBuild deferred tax assets have been impaired by our decision to spin off TopBuild into a separate company that on a stand-alone basis as of June 30, 2015, the spin off date, was unlikely to be able to realize the value of such deferred tax assets as a result of its history of losses.

We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States.  However, we believe that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods.  Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results under GAAP. 
  NET SALES 
    
  Net sales increased two percent and three percent for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2015. Excluding acquisitions and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, net sales increased three percent and four percent for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2015. The following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales, excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, in millions: 

North American net sales increased two percent and three percent for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2015. Net sales were positively impacted by increased sales volume of plumbing products, paints and other coating products and builders  hardware, which, in aggregate, increased North American sales by three percent and four percent for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2015. A favorable sales mix of cabinets and windows increased sales by one percent for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable periods of 2015. An increase in net selling prices of windows, cabinets and plumbing products increased sales one percent for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable periods of 2015. Such increases were partially offset by decreased sales volumes in cabinets and windows (three-month period only) and a decrease in net selling prices of paints and other coating products, which, in aggregate, decreased sales by three percent for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable periods of 2015. 
  International net sales increased one percent and two percent for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2015. In local currencies (including sales in currencies outside their respective functional currencies), net sales from International operations increased six percent for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable periods of 2015, primarily due to increased sales volume of international plumbing products, which increased sales by five percent  for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable periods of 2015. A favorable product mix of cabinets and windows, coupled with net selling price increases of international plumbing products, increased sales by one percent and two percent for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2015. An acquisition also increased sales by one percent for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable periods of 2015. Such increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency and lower sales volume of cabinets. 
    
  Net sales in the Plumbing Products segment increased for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable periods of 2015, due to increased sales volume of both North American and International operations, which, on a combined basis, increased sales by six percent for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable periods of 2015. Net selling price increases of both North American and International operations also increased sales by one percent for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable periods of 2015.  Such increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency, which decreased net sales by one percent in both the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable periods of 2015. 

21 

Net sales in the Decorative Architectural Products segment increased for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable periods of 2015, due to increased sales volumes of paints and other coating products and increased net selling prices of builder s hardware. An increase in sales volume of builder s hardware also increased net sales for the nine-month period. These increases were partially offset by lower net selling prices of paints and other coating products. 
    
  Net sales in the Cabinetry Products segment decreased for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable periods of 2015, due to decreased sales volume of both North American and international cabinets, which, in aggregate, decreased sales by 11 percent for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, and a stronger U.S. dollar which decreased sales by one percent for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods of 2015. Such decreases were partially offset by a positive sales mix for North American and international cabinets and net selling price increases for North American cabinets, which on a combined basis increased sales six percent for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable periods of 2015.  
    
  Net sales in the Windows and Other Specialty Products segment decreased for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable period of 2015, due to a stronger U.S. dollar, which decreased sales by four percent, and decreased sales volume of North American windows, which decreased sales by three percent, from the comparable period of 2015. Such decreases were partially offset by a favorable sales mix of North American and international windows and net selling prices of North American windows, which, in aggregate, increased sales five percent for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable period of 2015.  Net sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 increased from the comparable period of 2015, due to favorable net selling prices of North American windows, increased sales mix of North American and international windows, and an international acquisition, which, in aggregate, increased sales five percent, from the comparable period of 2015. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by two percent for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, from the comparable period of 2015. 

OPERATING MARGINS 
    
  Our gross profit margins were 32.7 and 33.6 percent for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with 32.0 percent and 31.7 percent for the comparable periods of 2015. 
    
  Gross profit margins for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 were positively affected by increased sales volume, a more favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs, as well as the benefits associated with other cost savings initiatives, partially offset by an increase in warranty costs resulting from a change in expected future warranty claim costs. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 18.4 percent and 18.7 percent for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 18.0 percent and 18.8 percent for the comparable periods of 2015. 
    
  Operating profit for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 includes   $6 million   and   $16 million  , respectively, of costs and charges related to our business rationalizations and other initiatives, compared with   $2 million   and   $9 million   for the comparable periods of 2015. 
    
  Operating margins in the Plumbing Products segment for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 were positively impacted by increased sales volume and a more favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs (including the favorable impact of the metal hedge contracts) and the benefits associated with business rationalization activities and other cost savings initiatives, partially offset by increases in certain variable expenses, such as selling and marketing costs and compensation expense, and an unfavorable product mix (nine-month period only).  
    
  Operating margins in the Decorative Architectural Products segment for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 were positively affected by increased sales volume of paints and other coating products, a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs of builder s hardware, as well as the benefits associated with cost savings initiatives, and, for the nine-month period, increased sales volume of builder's hardware. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs of paints and other coating products. 

22 

Operating margin in the Cabinetry Products segment for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was negatively affected by a decrease in sales volume for North American cabinets due primarily to the strategic decision to exit certain low margin business in our direct-to-builder channel as well as an increase in certain variable expenses such as costs supporting new product launches.  This decrease was partially offset by the benefits associated with business rationalization and cost savings initiatives, a positive product mix and a more favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs in our North America business. Operating margin for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was positively impacted by the benefits associated with business rationalization and other cost savings initiatives, a positive product mix and a more favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs in our North American business.  This increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales volume for both North American and international cabinets.  
    
  Operating margins in the Windows and Other Specialty Products segment for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 reflect an increase in warranty costs and certain other expenses, such as higher labor costs and ERP system implementation costs at our North American windows business.  Such costs were partially offset by a more favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with cost savings initiatives. 

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET 
    
  Interest expense for the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   was   $43 million   and   $186 million  , respectively, compared to   $54 million   and   $171 million   for the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Interest expense decreased for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   due to the issuance of notes at more favorable interest rates and the subsequent early retirement of debt. Interest expense increased for the nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016   due primarily to the   $40 million   of additional interest expense recorded in April 2016 in connection with the early retirement of debt, partially offset by the interest savings due to the discharge of indebtedness.  
    
  Other, net, for the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   included gains of   $1 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, related to distributions from private equity funds. The nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016   also included $1 million of earnings from equity investments and gains of   $1 million   on the redemption of auction rate securities. Other, net for the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2015   included gains of $1 million and $5 million, respectively, related to distributions from private equity funds and $2 million of earnings from equity investments for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.  

INCOME PER COMMON SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS   ATTRIBUTABLE TO MASCO CORPORATION 
    
  Income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   was   $134 million   and   $393 million  , respectively, compared with   $111 million   and   $281 million  , respectively, for the comparable periods of   2015  . Diluted earnings per common share for the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   was   $.40   and   $1.17  , respectively, per common share, compared with   $.32   and   $.81  , respectively, per common share for the comparable periods of   2015  . 
    
  Our effective tax rate was   36 percent   and   35   percent for the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   39   percent and   41   percent for the three-month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The decrease in the 2016 rates results primarily from the tax benefit of the domestic production deduction which allows a deduction for certain qualified production activities within the U.S.  This deduction was not available in 2015 due to the utilization of our U.S. Federal loss carryforward.  Additionally, the decrease in the nine-month rate is impacted by an   $18 million   valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of TopBuild recorded as a non-cash charge to income tax expense in the second quarter of 2015.  The TopBuild deferred tax assets have been impaired by our decision to spin off TopBuild into a separate company that on a stand-alone basis as of June 30, 2015, the spin off date, was unlikely to be able to realize the value of such deferred tax assets as a result of its history of losses.

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
    
  Our current ratio was   2.1   to 1 and   1.4   to 1 at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The increase in the current ratio was primarily due to the net debt reduction of   $400 million  .   
    
  For the   nine-month period ended     September 30, 2016  , net cash of   $382 million   was generated from operating activities.  
    
  For the   nine-month period ended     September 30, 2016  , net cash used by financing activities was   $759 million  , primarily due to the early retirement of all of our   $1 billion  ,   6.125%   Notes which were due on October 3, 2016 and all of our   $300 million  ,   5.85%   Notes which were due on March 15, 2017, $  242 million   for the repurchase and retirement of Company common stock (including 1.1 million  shares repurchased to offset the dilutive impact of long-term stock awards granted in 2016), $  95 million   for the payment of cash dividends and   $31 million   for dividends paid to noncontrolling interests.  This usage was partially offset by the issuance of   $400 million   of   3.5% Notes due April 1, 2021   and   $500 million   of   4.375% Notes due April 1, 2026  .   
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, our Board of Directors announced an increase to our annual dividend by $0.02 per common share, to $0.40 per common share, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  For the   nine-month period ended     September 30, 2016  , net cash used by investing activities was   $40 million  , and included   $117 million   for capital expenditures, partially offset by   $72 million   net proceeds from the sale of short-term bank cash deposits. 
    
  Our cash, cash investments and short-term bank deposits were   $1.2 billion   and   $1.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand accounts, time deposit accounts, and money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations.  Our short-term bank deposits consist of time deposits with maturities of 12 months or less. 
    
  Of the   $1.2 billion   and the   $1.7 billion   of cash, cash investments and short-term bank deposits held at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , $629 million and $630 million, respectively, is held in foreign subsidiaries.  If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., their repatriation into the U.S. would not result in significant additional U.S. income tax or foreign withholding tax, as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings, except for those that are legally restricted. 
    
  On   March 17, 2016  , we issued   $400 million   of   3.5%   Notes due April 1, 2021 and   $500 million   of   4.375%   Notes due April 1, 2026.  We received proceeds of $  896 million  , net of discount, for the issuance of these Notes. The Notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at our option at the applicable redemption price.  On April 15, 2016, proceeds from the debt issuances, together with cash on hand, were used to repay and early retire all of our   $1 billion  ,   6.125%   Notes which were due on October 3, 2016 and all of our   $300 million  ,   5.85%   Notes which were due on March 15, 2017.  In connection with these early retirements, we incurred $40 million of debt extinguishment costs, which we recorded as interest expense.  
    
  On March 28, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with a bank group, with an aggregate commitment of $1.25 billion and a maturity date of March 28, 2018.  On May 29, 2015 and August 28, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement with the bank group (the  Amended Credit Agreement ).  The Amended Credit Agreement reduces the aggregate commitment to $750 million and extends the maturity date to May 29, 2020.  Under the Amended Credit Agreement, at our request and subject to certain conditions, we can increase the aggregate commitment up to an additional $375 million with the current bank group or new lenders.  See Note H to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The Amended Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain (A) a maximum net leverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, of 4.0 to 1.0, and (B) a minimum interest coverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, equal to or greater than 2.5 to 1.0.  We were in compliance with all covenants and had no borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We believe that our present cash balance, cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, bank borrowings and future financial market activities, are sufficient to fund our working capital and other investment needs. 

24 

OUTLOOK FOR THE COMPANY 
    
  We continue to successfully execute against our long-term growth strategies by leveraging our brand portfolio, industry-leading positions, and Masco Operating System, our methodology to drive growth and productivity. We believe we will continue to see strong demand for our market-leading products, as the fundamentals for long-term demand in both repair and remodel and new home construction continue to be positive. We believe that our strong financial position, together with our current strategy of investing in our industry-leading branded building products, our continued focus on innovation and our commitment to operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation will allow us to drive long-term growth and create value for our shareholders.

    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

a.     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
    
  The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded, based on an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  b.     Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company continued a phased deployment of a new Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) system at Milgard. The system implementation is designed, in part, to enhance the overall system of internal control over financial reporting through further automation and improve business processes and is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. However, this system implementation is significant in scale and complexity and has resulted in modification to certain Milgard internal controls.
