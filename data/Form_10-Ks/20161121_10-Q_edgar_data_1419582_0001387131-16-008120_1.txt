NOTE
1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual consolidated financial
statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary
to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of Blue Sphere Corporation (the  Company ). These
condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the Company s
audited financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2015, as filed with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The results of operations for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 are
not necessarily indicative of results that could be expected for the entire fiscal year.  

NOTE
2   GENERAL  

Blue Sphere Corporation
(the  Company ), together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Eastern Sphere Ltd. ( Eastern ), BinoSphere
LLC ( Binosphere ), Johnstonsphere LLC ( Johnstonsphere ), Sustainable Energy Ltd. ( SEL ),
and Blue Sphere Brabant B.V. ( BSB ), is focused on project integration in the clean energy production and waste to
energy markets.  

The Company was incorporated
in the state of Nevada on July 17, 2007 and was originally in the business of developing and promoting automotive internet sites.
On February 17, 2010, the Company conducted a reverse merger, name change and forward split of its common stock, and in March 2010
current management took over operations, at which point the Company changed its business focus to become a project integrator in
the clean energy production and waste to energy markets. 

As of September 30, 2016, Johnstonsphere
and BSB had not commenced operations. 

On May 12, 2015 the
Company formed Bluesphere Pavia (formerly called Bluesphere Italy S.r.l.), a subsidiary of Eastern, in order to
acquire certain biogas plants located in Italy (see note 3 below).

3   INVESTMENT IN BLUE SPHERE PAVIA  

On August 18, 2015, the Company
and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Eastern and Bluesphere Pavia, entered into
a Long Term Mezzanine Loan Agreement (the  Helios Loan Agreement ) with Helios Italy Bio-Gas 1 L.P. ( Helios ).
Under the Helios Loan Agreement, i  Helios will make up to $5,646,628 ( 5,000,000) available to Bluesphere Pavia
(the  Helios Loan ) to finance (a) ninety percent (90%) of the total required investment of the first four SVPs acquired,
(b) eighty percent (80%) of the total required investment of up to three SVPs subsequently acquired, (c) certain broker fees incurred
in connection with the acquisitions, and (d) any taxes associated with registration of an equity pledge agreement (as described
below). Each financing of an SVP acquisition will be subject to specified conditions precedent and will constitute a separate loan
under the Helios Loan Agreement. Subject to specified terms, representations and warranties, the Helios Loan Agreement provides
that each loan thereunder will accrue interest at a rate of 14.5% per annum, paid quarterly. Helios will also be entitled to an
annual operation fee, paid quarterly. The final payment for each loan will become due no later than the earlier of (a) thirteen
and one half years from the date such loan was made available to Bluesphere Italy, and (b) the date that the Feed in Tariff license
granted to the relevant SVP expires. Pursuant to the Helios Loan Agreement and an equity pledge agreement, Eastern Sphere pledged
all its shares in Bluesphere Pavia to secure all loan amounts utilized under the Helios Loan Agreement. 

On December 14, 2015 ( Closing
Date ), and pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement, dated May 14, 2015 (the  Share Purchase Agreement ), by
and among the Company s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Bluesphere Pavia, Volteo Energie S.p.A., Agriholding S.r.l., and
Overland S.r.l. (collectively, the  Sellers ), Bluesphere Pavia completed the acquisitions of one hundred percent
(100%) of the share capital of Agricerere S.r.l., Agrielektra S.r.l., Agrisorse S.r.l. and Gefa S.r.l . (each, an  SPV 
and collectively, the  SPVs ) from the Sellers. Each SPV owns and operates an anaerobic digestion biogas plant in
Italy for the production and sale of electricity to Gestore del Servizi Energetici GSE, S.p.A., a state-owned company, pursuant
to a power purchase agreement. Pursuant to the Italy Projects Agreement, the Company also issued a corporate guarantee to the
Sellers, whereby the Company will secure the obligations of Bluesphere Pavia under the Italy Projects Agreement. 

Pursuant to the Share Purchase
Agreement, the Company to pay $5,646,628 ( 5,200,000) (the  Purchase Price ), subject to certain post-closing
adjustments, to acquire the share capital of the SPVs. The Purchase Price for each SPV was determined based on a Base Line EBITDA
guaranteed by the Sellers and an Equity IRR Target calculated on the Purchase Price of no less than twenty-five percent (25%).
Fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase Price, adjusted for certain post-closing adjustments and closing costs, in the amount of $2,143,181
( 1,952,858) was paid at closing, and the balance is due to the Sellers on the third anniversary of the closing date. The
remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase Price, prior to and after closing date, and any variation of EBITDA results in the
18 months following the closing date , will be promised by a note from each Seller, to be paid on the third anniversary of the
closing, along with interest on the unpaid balance due at an annual rate of two percent (2%).. The portion of the Purchase Price
paid at closing was primarily financed by a loan of $3,149,081 ( 2,900,000) pursuant to the Helios Loan Agreement whereas
the Company repaid $404,000 ( 365,303) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

3   INVESTMENT IN BLUE SPHERE PAVIA (continued)  

In accordance with a
Framework EBITDA Guarantee Agreement, dated July 17, 2015 (the  EBITDA Agreement ), between the Company and
Austep S.p.A. ( Austep ), Austep will operate, maintain and supervise each biogas plant owned by the SPVs. In
addition, Austep guaranteed a monthly aggregate EBITDA of $204,147 ( 188,000) from the four SPVs for the initial six
months following the acquisition, and thereafter Austep will guarantee an annual aggregate EBITDA of $4,082,946
( 3,760,000) from the four SPVs. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements with Austep, the Company will receive the
guaranteed levels of EBITDA and Austep will receive ninety percent (90%) of the revenue in excess of these levels. 

The Company applied the equity method of accounting for those investments because the Framework EBITDA Guarantee
Agreement between the Company and Austep whereas Austep operates, maintains and supervises each biogas
plants prevents us from exercising a controlling influence over operating policies of the plants. Under this method, our equity
investment is reflected as an investment in non-consolidated subsidiaries on our Condensed Balance Sheets and the net earnings
or losses of the investments is reflected as equity in net earnings of non-consolidated companies on our Consolidated Statements
of Operations. 

NOTE
4   CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the nine and three months then ended have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States relating to the preparation of financial statements
for interim periods. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required for annual financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  

The September 30, 2015 Condensed
Balance Sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2015.

STATEMENTS (unaudited) 

NOTE 5   SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The significant accounting policies
applied in the annual financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2015, are applied consistently in these financial
statements except for the following: 

a.   
     
           Business Combinations and
Goodwill     

The Company accounts for its
business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. Under this method, the Company allocates the purchase price to tangible
and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, with the excess
of the purchase price amount being allocated to goodwill. Acquisition-related and integration costs associated to the business
combination are expensed as incurred. Changes in estimates associated with future income tax assets after measurement period are
recognized as income tax expense with prospective application to all business combinations regardless of the date of acquisition.
Goodwill for each reporting unit is assessed for impairment at least annually, or when an event or circumstance occurs that more
likely than not reduces the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recorded when the
carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value and is determined as the difference between the goodwill s carrying
amount and its implied fair value. 

b.   
     
           Investment in non-consolidated and affiliated companies     

Investments in non-consolidated
and affiliated companies that are not controlled but over which the Company can exercise significant influence (generally, entities
in which the Company holds approximately between 20% to 100% of the voting rights of the investee) are presented using the equity
method of accounting. Profits on intercompany sales, not realized outside the Company, are eliminated. The Company discontinues
applying the equity method when its investment (including advances and loans) is reduced to zero and the Company has not guaranteed
obligations of the affiliate or otherwise committed to provide further financial support to the affiliate. 

Investments in preferred
shares, which are not in substance common stock, are recorded on a cost basis according to ASC 323-10-15-13,  Investments
- Equity Method and Joint Ventures - In-substance Common Stock  and ASC 323-10-40-1,  Investment -Equity Method and
Joint Ventures - Investee Capital Transactions . 

A change in the Company s
proportionate share of an investee s equity, resulting from issuance of common or in-substance common shares by the investee
to third parties, is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated income statements in accordance with ASC 323-10-40-1. 

Investments in non-marketable
equity securities of entities in which the Company does not have control or the ability to exercise significant influence over
their operation and financial policies, are recorded at cost (generally when the Company holds less than 20% of the voting rights). 

Management evaluates
investments in affiliated companies, partnerships and other non-marketable equity securities for evidence of other-than-temporary
declines in value. Such evaluation is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances. Accordingly, in determining whether other-than-temporary
declines exist, management evaluates various indicators for other-than-temporary declines and evaluates financial information (e.g.
budgets, business plans, financial statements, etc.). During 2015 and 2014, no material impairment was recognized. 

c.   
     
           Intangible Assets     

Intangible assets consist of
non-monetary and separately identifiable assets, which can be controlled and are expected to generate future economic benefits.
Such assets are recognized at acquisition and/or production cost, including directly attributable expenses to make the asset ready
for use, net of accumulated amortization charges and any impairment losses. 

The costs incurred internally
to develop new services and platforms are considered intangible assets generated internally and are recognized as assets only if
the following requirements are met: 

1. 
     the cost incurred for the development of the assets can be reliably measured;  

2. 
     the entity has the intention, the availability of financial resources, the ability to complete the assets and to use or sell them;  

Capitalized development costs
include only expenses incurred that can be directly attributed to the process of developing new products and services. 

Intangible assets with a finite
useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives and are tested for impairment when circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for intangible assets with a finite
useful lives are reviewed at least at each reporting date. 

10  

BLUE SPHERE CORPORATION  

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (unaudited) 

NOTE 5   SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  

Changes in expected useful lives,
or in the way the future economic benefits will be generated by the assets, are either recognized through a change in the period
or in the amortization method and are accounted for as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization charges for intangible
assets with a finite useful life are classified in the statement of income, in the costs appropriate for the function of the related
intangible assets. 

d.   
     
           Long-Lived Assets   

When events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets, such as capital assets and intangible assets, may not be recoverable, undiscounted
estimated cash flows are projected over their remaining term and compared to the carrying amount. To the extent that such projections
indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets, a charge is
recorded to reduce the carrying amount to the projected future discounted cash flows. 

NOTE 6   GOING CONCERN  

The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company had approximately $375,000 in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $11,618,000 in negative working capital, a
stockholders  deficit of approximately $8,949,000 and an accumulated deficit of approximately $52,114,000. Management
anticipates their business will require substantial additional investments that have not yet been secured. Management is
continuing in the process of fund raising in the private equity markets as the Company will need to finance future
activities. Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising capital from financing
transactions and revenue from operations. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent
on its ability to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. 

NOTE 7   NEWLY ISSUED
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

No new accounting standards
have been adopted since the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was filed.

8   COMMON SHARES  

On January 26, 2016, the Company
issued 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock, pursuant to a subscription
agreement dated June 12, 2015. 

On February 1, 2016 the
Company issued 540,000 shares Common Stock to a consultant in respect of his consulting services for the Company. The Company
has estimated the fair value of such shares, and recorded an expense of $108,327.  

In February 2016, the Company
conducted an offering (the  February Offering ) consisting of (a) up to USD $1,925,000 of the Company s shares
of Common Stock, priced at the closing price for shares of Common Stock, as reported on the OTCQB Venture Marketplace, on the trading
day prior to the closing of the February Offering, and (b) 5-year warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock in an amount equal
to 50% of the number of shares of Common Stock so purchased by the subscriber (the  February Warrants , together with
the shares of Common Stock subscribed for, the  February Securities ). The February Securities have been offered pursuant
to subscription agreements with each investor (the  February Subscription Agreement ). In addition to other customary
provisions, each February Subscription Agreement provides that the Company will use its reasonable commercial efforts to register
all shares of Common Stock sold in the February Offering, including all shares of Common Stock underlying the February Warrants,
within 60 days of the closing of the February Offering. The February Warrants are exercisable for 5 years from the date of issuance
at $0.10 per share, include an option by which the holder may exercise the February Warrant by means of a cashless exercise, and
include customary weighted-average price adjustment and anti-dilution terms. On February 15, 2016, the Company completed the only
closing of the February Offering, representing aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $1,925,000. In connection with the closing,
the Company and subscribers entered into (a) February Subscription Agreements for, in the aggregate, 35,000,000 shares of Common
Stock at $0.055 per share, and (b) February Warrants to purchase, in the aggregate, up to 17,500,000 shares of Common Stock at
an exercise price of $0.10 per share. The warrants were accounted for as derivative liabilities. The Company has estimated the
fair value of such warrants at a value of $933,358 at the date of issuance and using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using
the following assumptions:

Maxim received commissions equal to 7% of the gross proceeds raised by Maxim in the February Offering, warrants to purchase, in
the aggregate, up to 2,800,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.0605 per share and to purchase, in the aggregate,
up to 1,400,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.11 per share. The Company has estimated the fair value of such
warrants at a value of $224,413 at the date of issuance and using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions:

Company Overview  

Summary of Current Operations   

We are an international Independent Power Producer
(IPP) that is globally active in the clean energy production and waste-to-energy markets. We are becoming a key player in these
rapidly growing markets by developing or acquiring projects with clean energy technologies, including but not limited to waste-to-energy
facilities that generate clean energy, such as electricity, natural gas, heat, compost and other by-products. These markets provide
tremendous opportunity, insofar as there is a virtually endless supply of waste and organic material that can be used to generate
power and valuable by-products. In particular, the disposal of organic material to landfills in most parts of the world is a costly
problem with environmentally-damaging consequences. We seek to offer a cost-effective, environmentally-safe alternative. 

We are currently developing or operating, as applicable,
the following projects: 

United States (Developing)  

Charlotte, NC Waste to Energy Anaerobic Digester 5.2 MW Plant   

Johnston, RI Waste to Energy Anaerobic Digester 3.2 MW Plant   

Italy (Operating)  

Soc. agr. AGRICERERE srl   Tromello (Pavia) 999 KW Plant   

Soc. agr. AGRIELEKTRA srl   Alagna (Pavia) 999 KW Plant   

Soc. agr. AGRISORSE srl - Garlasco (Pavia) 999 KW Plant   

Soc. agr. GEFA srl   Dorno (Pavia) 999 KW Plant   

We have also entered into nonbinding letters of
intent to acquire additional biogas facilities in Italy and construct and develop waste-to-energy facilities in the Netherlands,
and we continue to evaluate a pipeline of similar projects in a less mature phase. 

Results of Operations  

General   

On
December 14, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Bluesphere Pavia completed the acquisitions of one hundred percent (100%) of
the share capital of Agricerere S.r.l., Agrielektra S.r.l., Agrisorse S.r.l. and Gefa S.r.l. (each, an  SPV  and
collectively, the  SPVs ). Each SPV owns and operates an anaerobic digestion biogas plant in Italy for the
production and sale of electricity to Gestore del Servizi Energetici GSE, S.p.A., a state-owned company, pursuant to a power
purchase agreement. Our results of operation and have been significantly affected by this transaction. The Company applied
the equity method of accounting for those investments because the Framework EBITDA Guarantee Agreement between the Company
and Austep whereas Austep operates, maintains and supervises each biogas plants prevents us from exercising a controlling
influence over operating policies of the plants. Under this method, our equity investment is reflected as an investment in
non-consolidated subsidiaries on our Condensed Balance Sheets and the net earnings or losses of the investments is reflected
as equity in net earnings of non-consolidated companies on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.  

Deferred Revenue   

$1,481,900
 of development fees and reimbursements for the North Carolina and Rhode Island projects are recorded as deferred revenue.
Upon successful completion of the projects, this amount will be recorded as revenue. 

Results of Operations   For the Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

General and Administrative Expenses   

General and administrative expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 were $1,682,000 as
compared to $1,054,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Loss   

We incurred a net loss of $629,000 for the
three-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a net loss of $1,204,000 for the three-month period ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in net loss is mainly attributable to a decrease in financial expenses and decrease in increase in equity
losses in non-consolidated subsidiaries.  

Results of Operations   For the Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

General and Administrative Expenses   

General and administrative expenses for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016 were $6,287,000 as compared to $4,504,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.  

Net Loss   

We incurred a net loss of $7,422,000 for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a net loss of $6,148,000 for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2015. The increase in net loss is mainly attributable to increase in general and administrative expenses
and increase in equity losses in non-consolidated subsidiaries. 

Inflation and Seasonality  

In management s opinion, our results of operations
have not been materially affected by inflation or seasonality, and management does not expect that inflation risk or seasonality
would cause material impact on our operations in the future. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate
funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant
factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and
capital expenditures. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had
cash and cash equivalents of $375,000 as compared to $161,000 as of September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, we had a working
capital deficit of $11,618,000, as compared to $7,542,000 as of September 30, 2015. The increase in our working capital deficit
is mainly attributable to the increase in our deferred revenues from joint ventures in the amount of $4,302,000, the increase
in our current maturities of long term loans in the amount of $315,000, the increase in our accounts payables in the amount of
$759,000 and the increase in our other accounts payable and liabilities in the amount of $565,000. The increase in our working
capital deficit was mitigated by an increase in our other current assets in the amount of $1,651,000.  

Net cash used in operating activities
was $4,181,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to cash from operating activities of $108,000 for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.  

Net cash used in investing activities
was $60,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $23,000
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. 

Net cash provided by financing activities
was approximately $2,728,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to approximately $128,000 provided
by financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.  

We have principally financed our operations
through the sale of our Common Stock and warrants and the issuance of convertible debt, including the Debenture Offering,
February Offering, June Offering and the October Financing described in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this quarterly report. 

Change in Fiscal Year   

As previously reported, on January 24, 2016, the
Company s Board of Directors changed the Company s fiscal year end from September 30 to December 31, effective January
1, 2016. As a result of this change, the Company filed a Transition Report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended December
31, 2015, and the Company will file audited financials for the three-month period ended December 31, 2015 with its Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments
and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments
and estimates in the preparation of financial statements. No new accounting standards have been adopted since the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was filed. The significant accounting policies applied
in the annual financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2015 are applied consistently in these financial statements,
except for the following: 

a.      Business Combinations and Goodwill     

The Company accounts for its business
combinations using the purchase method of accounting. Under this method, the Company allocates the purchase price to tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, with the excess of
the purchase price amount being allocated to goodwill. 

Acquisition-related and integration costs
associated with the business combination are expensed as incurred. Changes in estimates associated with future income tax assets
after measurement period are recognized as income tax expense with prospective application to all business combinations regardless
of the date of acquisition. 

Goodwill for each reporting unit is assessed
for impairment at least annually, or when an event or circumstance occurs that more likely than not reduces the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recorded when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds
its fair value and is determined as the difference between the goodwill s carrying amount and its implied fair value. 

b.      Investment in non-consolidated and affiliated companies     

Investments in non-consolidated
and affiliated companies that are not controlled but over which the Company can exercise significant influence (generally, entities
in which the Company holds approximately between 20% to 100% of the voting rights of the investee) are presented using the equity
method of accounting. Profits on intercompany sales, not realized outside the Company, are eliminated. The Company discontinues
applying the equity method when its investment (including advances and loans) is reduced to zero and the Company has not guaranteed
obligations of the affiliate or otherwise committed to provide further financial support to the affiliate. 

Investments in preferred shares,
which are not in substance common stock, are recorded on a cost basis according to ASC 323-10-15-13,  Investments - Equity
Method and Joint Ventures - In-substance Common Stock  and ASC 323-10-40-1,  Investment -Equity Method and Joint Ventures
- Investee Capital Transactions . 

A change in the Company s
proportionate share of an investee s equity, resulting from issuance of common or in-substance common shares by the investee
to third parties, is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated income statements in accordance with ASC 323-10-40-1. 

Investments in non-marketable
equity securities of entities in which the Company does not have control or the ability to exercise significant influence over
their operation and financial policies, are recorded at cost (generally when the Company holds less than 20% of the voting rights). 

Management evaluates investments
in affiliated companies, partnerships and other non-marketable equity securities for evidence of other-than-temporary declines
in value. Such evaluation is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances. Accordingly, in determining whether other-than-temporary
declines exist, management evaluates various indicators for other-than-temporary declines and evaluates financial information (e.g.
budgets, business plans, financial statements, etc.). During 2015 and 2014, no material impairment was recognized. 

c.      Intangible Assets     

Intangible assets consist of non-monetary
and separately identifiable assets that can be controlled and are expected to generate future economic benefits. Such assets are
recognized at acquisition and/or production cost, including directly attributable expenses to make the asset ready for use, net
of accumulated amortization charges and any impairment losses. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line
basis over their useful lives and are tested for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
The amortization period and the amortization method for intangible assets with a finite useful lives are reviewed at least at each
reporting date. 

d.      Long-Lived Assets     

When events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets, such as capital assets and intangible assets, may not be recoverable, undiscounted
estimated cash flows are projected over their remaining term and compared to the carrying amount. To the extent that such projections
indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets, a charge is
recorded to reduce the carrying amount to the projected future discounted cash flows. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As at September 30, 2016, we had no off-balance
sheet arrangements of any nature. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK.  

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to provide the information required by this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules
and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

  Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under
the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation with the participation of the Company s management, including the
Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and the Company s Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ),
of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15 (e) under the Exchange
Act) as of the three months ended September 30, 2016. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that,
as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that (i) information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.  

  Management is in the process of
determining how best to change our current system and implement a more effective system to ensure that information required
to be disclosed has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately. Our management acknowledges the existence
of this issue, and intends to develop procedures to address it to the extent possible given limitations in financial and
human resources in and to remediate all the material weaknesses by the end of the fiscal year ending December 31,
2016.  

  Changes in Internal Controls  

Our management, with the participation
of our CEO and CFO, performed an evaluation to determine whether any change in our internal controls over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016. Based on
that evaluation, our CEO and our CFO concluded that changes occurred in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting
during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. Specifically, the Company consolidated the roles and responsibilities
of two individuals providing CFO services into one full-time CFO position.  

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.  

On
October 22, 2016, the law firm of JS Barkats PLLC filed a complaint against the Company and Shlomo Palas, the Company s
Chief Executive Officer, seeking allegedly unpaid legal fees for services rendered from June 9, 2011 through April 23, 2012 in
the amount of USD $428,964.70, plus interest for a total of USD $652,000 (the  Barkats Litigation ). The Barkats Litigation
was filed as JS Barkats PLLC v. Blue Sphere Corporation and Shlomo Palas with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the
County of New York (the  New York Court ), Index No. 655600/2016. On October 26, 2016, without notice to the Company
or Mr. Palas or an opportunity to be heard, the New York Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (the  TRO ) in
favor JS Barkats PLLC, prohibiting the Company and Mr. Palas from  transferring or dissipating their assets   to
the extent of $652,000 , pending the return date of JS Barkats PLLC s asset attachment motion, due November 17, 2016.
On October 31, 2016, the Company removed the Barkats Litigation to federal court, filed as JS Barkats PLLC v. Blue Sphere Corporation
and Shlomo Palas with the United Stated District Court, Southern District Court of New York, Docket No. 1:16-cv-08404. The Company
terminated the services of JS Barkats LLC in 2012 and believes the claims brought by JS Barkats PLLC are without merit, that the
TRO was improvidently granted, and that JS Barkats PLLC misrepresented, mischaracterized and omitted material facts and the law
in seeking the TRO. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the Barkats Litigation, the TRO and any other attempts to
attach the assets of the Company.
