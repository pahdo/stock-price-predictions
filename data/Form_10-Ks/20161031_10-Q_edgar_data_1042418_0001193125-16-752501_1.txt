  Corporate overview:        Overview   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of HedgePath Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ,
 HPPI ,  we ,  us ,  our  or similar terminology), have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to
present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of September 30, 2016, and for all periods presented, have been made.  
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the accompanying financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). These unaudited condensed
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on
February 1, 2016 (the  2015 Annual Report ). The accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all information and footnotes
required by GAAP for complete financial statements.    As used herein, the term  Common Stock  means the Company s common
stock, $0.0001 par value per share.    The results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year. Readers of this Quarterly Report are strongly encouraged to review the risk factors relating to the Company which are set forth in the
2015 Annual Report and our other filings with the SEC.    The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities of the Company in the normal course of business. If the Company is unable to general revenue or raise required funding to continue to pursue its business plan, it may have
to cease operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  
  Nature of the Business   
 The Company is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that is seeking to discover, develop and commercialize innovative therapeutics for
patients with certain cancers. The Company may also explore acquiring or licensing other innovative therapeutics addressing unmet needs and orphan indications beyond cancer. The Company s preliminary and current focus is on the
development of therapies for skin, lung and prostate cancers in the United States of America ( U.S. ) market, with the first indication targeting basal cell carcinoma in patients with Basal Cell Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome (also known as
Gorlin Syndrome) for which the Company is presently conducting an open label Phase II(b) clinical trial.   The Company s proposed
therapy is based upon the use of SUBA -Itraconazole, which is a patented, oral formulation of the currently marketed anti-fungal drug Itraconazole to which the Company holds an exclusive U.S. license. The Company believes that the dosing of
oral capsules of this formulation can affect the Hedgehog signaling pathway, a major regulator of many fundamental cellular processes, which, in turn, can impact the development and growth of cancers such as basal cell carcinoma. Itraconazole has
been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the  FDA ) for, and has been extensively used to treat, fungal infections and has an extensive history of safe and effective use in humans. The Company has developed and licensed
intellectual property and know-how related to the treatment of cancer patients using itraconazole.     Relationship with Mayne Pharma
Ventures Pty Ltd.     The Company has exclusive rights in the U.S. to develop and to commercialize SUBA-Itraconazole capsules for the
treatment of human cancer via oral administration. SUBA-Itraconazole was developed and is licensed to the Company by the Company s

  (Unaudited)       

   1. Corporate overview (continued):   

manufacturing partner and significant shareholder Mayne Pharma Ventures Pty Ltd. and its affiliates ( Mayne Pharma ) under a supply and license agreement, originally dated
September 3, 2013 and most recently amended and restated on May 15, 2015 (the  SLA ). Mayne Pharma is an Australian specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and manufactures branded and generic products, which it
distributes directly or through distribution partners and also provides contract development and manufacturing services. In addition to being the Company s licensor and supply partner, under the SLA and related agreements, Mayne Pharma holds a
significant minority equity stake in the Company and holds important rights with respect to the Company, such as the right to appoint a member to the Company s Board of Directors.  
  May 2016 financing     On
May 25, 2016, the Company conducted the final closing (the  Final Closing ) of its previously announced  best efforts/no minimum  private placement offering to accredited investors (the  Offering ) of the
Company s units (each a  Unit ) at a price of $0.10 per Unit, with each Unit consisting of: (i) one (1) share of Common Stock, and (ii) a five-year warrant to purchase one (1) share of Common Stock at an exercise
price of $0.12 per share (each a  Warrant ). No actual Units were issued, and each investor received shares of Common Stock and Warrants only. During the course of the Offering, which began on March 30, 2016, the Company sold all
55,000,000 Units reserved for the Offering for aggregate gross proceeds of $5,500,000 including the Units sold to Mayne Pharma as described below.  
 The Company granted to investors in the Offering certain registration rights requiring the Company, following the Final Closing, to file a
registration statement with the SEC covering the resale by such investors and their assignees of the shares of Common Stock issued in the Offering and the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants issued in the Offering. The Company was
required to use its commercially best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective. The Company filed the registration statement with the SEC in June 2016, and it was declared effective on July 22, 2016.  
 In connection with the Final Closing, and pursuant to an existing right of Mayne Pharma to purchase its pro rata share, on a fully-diluted
basis, of new securities issuances of the Company (the  Mayne Right of First Refusal ), the Company entered into a definitive Securities Purchase Agreement ( SPA ) (in substantially the same form as the securities purchase
agreement executed by other investors in the Offering) with Mayne Pharma, and in connection therewith issued an aggregate of 27,885,000 Units to Mayne Pharma, consisting of an aggregate of 27,885,000 shares of Common Stock and a Warrant to purchase
up to an aggregate of 27,885,000 shares of Common Stock, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $2,788,500.   In connection with the
Offering, the Company engaged certain FINRA-member agents to help it secure investors for the Offering (the  Finders Arrangements ). Such agents secured investors for an aggregate of $582,500 for the Offering and received commissions equal
to an aggregate of $46,600 in cash and warrants (in substantially the form of the Warrants) to purchase 466,000 shares of Common Stock. Pursuant to the Mayne Right of First Refusal, the Company issued and sold to Mayne a warrant to purchase 479,236
shares of Common Stock for a purchase price of $47,924 (the  Mayne Finders Warrant ), which constituted Mayne s pro rata share, on a fully-diluted basis, of all warrants issued in connection with the Finders Arrangements, inclusive of
the Mayne Finders Warrant. For ease of administration, the 479,236 shares of Common Stock underlying the Mayne Finders Warrant were added to the Mayne Offering Warrant, resulting in the issuance to Mayne of a single Warrant to purchase 28,364,236
shares of Common Stock.

2.  
  Liquidity and management s plans:       At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and
cash equivalents of approximately $3.6 million. Based on the Company s current operational plan and budget, the Company expects that it has sufficient cash to manage its business into approximately the first quarter of 2018, although this
estimation assumes the Company does not accelerate the development of the existing product candidate, acquire other drug development opportunities, or otherwise face unexpected events, costs or contingencies, any of which could affect the
Company s cash requirements. Available resources may be consumed more rapidly than anticipated, potentially resulting in the need for additional funding. Additional funding from any source (including equity and debt financings) may be
unavailable on favorable terms, if at all.   Not included in the foregoing estimate of the timing for the availability of existing Company
cash reserves is the potential that the Company might be required to use cash to pay payroll taxes upon the vesting of certain restricted stock units ( RSUs ) in 2017 in the event the Company is unable to secure funding to cover the
payroll tax liability or otherwise employ strategies aimed at satisfying such liability. Such payment could significantly reduce the Company s cash resources and possibly require the Company to raise new funding earlier than expected in
order to fund planned operations as projected.      

3.  
  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:        Estimates   
 The preparation of condensed financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
  Revenue Recognition     The
Company currently has no ongoing source of revenues. Miscellaneous income is recognized when earned by the Company.     Cash and Cash
Equivalents     The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. At times, the Company may maintain cash balances in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured amounts which is $250,000 for substantially all depository accounts. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
approximately $3.2 million which exceeded these insured limits.     Research and Development Expenses   
 Research and development costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and include the expenses paid to third parties who conduct
research and development activities on behalf of the Company and purchased in-process research and development.     Stock-Based
Compensation     The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees and non-employees using Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718   Accounting for Share-Based Payments, which provides for the use of the fair value based method to determine compensation for all arrangements where shares of
stock or equity instruments are issued for compensation. Fair values of RSUs issued are determined by the Company based predominantly on the trading price of the common stock on the date of grant. Fair value of each common stock option is estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model that uses assumptions for expected volatility, expected dividends, expected term, and the risk-free interest rate. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer
group s common stock and other factors estimated over the expected term of the options. The expected term of the options granted is derived using the

  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued):         
  
 simplified method  which computes expected term as the average of the sum of the vesting term plus the contract term. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
yield. In applying the Black-Scholes options pricing model for options issued in July 2016 (see Note 5), the assumptions are as follows: expected price volatility of 113.16%; risk-free interest rate of 1.14%; weighted average expected life
in years of 6; and no dividend yield. The value of these awards is based upon their grant-date fair value. That cost is recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.  
  Income Taxes     Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributed to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using
enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to the differences in the periods that they are expected to reverse.     Recent accounting
pronouncements:     In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers,  which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition  and most industry-specific guidance on revenue recognition
throughout the ASC. The new standard is principles-based and provides a five step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized when a company transfers promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also requires disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information
surrounding the amount, nature, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new standard, as updated in 2015, will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of the year ending
December 31, 2018 and can be applied either retrospectively to all periods presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company will evaluate the impact of adoption of the new
standard on its financial statements upon commencement of revenue generating activities.    In August 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU
2014-15 is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosure. This ASU provides guidance
to an organization s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The
amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial
statements have not previously been issued. The Company is evaluating the impact the guidance will have on its financial statements.      

4.  
  Other liabilities       At December 31, 2015, other liabilities included $52,500 payable
to a third party service provider which was required to be settled in stock upon the completion of at least a $5 million stock offering. That liability was renegotiated and settled in May 2016 with $25,000 in cash resulting in a gain of $27,500
which is included as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the accompanying 2016 condensed statements of operations.

5.  
  Stockholders  Equity:        Employee Stock Plans   
 Total stock-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $1.7 million and is related to certain RSUs and
stock options issued in connection with the Company s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. The expense is classified as research and development expense and general and administrative expense in the accompanying condensed statements of operations.
The grant date fair value of RSUs was determined using the quoted market price of the Common Stock on the date of issuance and the number of shares expected to vest. 
 In June 2016, the vesting and payment dates for certain RSUs originally scheduled to vest in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was extended
until March 2017. These RSUs were revalued using the quoted market price of the Common Stock on the date the vesting was extended. The expense associated with the increase in value will be recognized over the extended vesting period
including approximately $0.4 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016.    On July 1, 2016, the three independent members of the
Company s Board of Directors and the Company s Secretary and Chief Compliance Officer received a total grant of 650,000 RSUs and 650,000 common stock options with an exercise price of $0.24 per share and Black-Scholes value of $0.192 per
share. The options vest over three years on the anniversary of the grant date and as of September 30, 2016 had an intrinsic value of approximately $0.1 million. As of September 30, 2016, there were 26,541,738 RSUs and 650,000 Common Stock
options granted to various members of the Board of Directors, management and other employees. There was approximately $1.9 million in unamortized stock-based compensation relating to RSUs and stock options as of September 30, 2016, which is
expected to be recognized over the next 33 months.     

6.  
  Legal Proceedings:       The Company is currently not subject to any material legal
proceedings. However, the Company may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.

Item 2.  
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Condensed Financial Statements and Notes thereto
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company s actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those
discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth herein and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in the Company s other filings with the SEC. See  Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements  below.      As used in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, unless otherwise indicated, the terms  the Company ,  we ,  us ,  our  and similar terminology refer to both, as the context requires, the present activity of HPPI and the
historic activity of CBI, as the context requires.      Critical Accounting Policies   
 See Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for a summary of significant
accounting policies and information on recently issued accounting pronouncements.     Results of Operations   
   For the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015    
  Research and Development Expenses.  We recognized approximately $0.7 million in research and development expenses during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily related to an approximately $0.1 million increase in stock compensation expense related primarily to the
deferral of vesting and payment of certain previously granted equity awards.     General and Administrative Expenses.  We recognized
approximately $1.0 million in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of compensation and related costs for corporate administrative staff, facility expenditures, professional fees, consulting and taxes. The increase is primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense of approximately $0.3 million
related primarily to the deferral of vesting and payment of certain previously granted equity awards.      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015       Research and Development Expenses.  We recognized approximately $1.9
million in research and development expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses for the both periods primarily
consist of expenses related to our clinical trial for Basal Cell Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome, regulatory activities, legal expenses relating to patents, and stock-based compensation. The increase is primarily related to approximately $0.6 million in
research and development expenses related to our clinical trial for Basal Cell Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome for which we commenced dosing patients in September 2015 and an increase of $0.1 million in stock compensation related primarily to the deferral
of vesting and payment of certain previously granted equity awards.    General and Administrative Expenses.  We recognized
approximately $2.4 million in general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of compensation and related costs for corporate administrative staff, facility expenditures, professional fees, consulting and taxes. The increase is primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense of approximately $0.3 million
related primarily to the deferral of vesting and payment of certain previously granted equity awards, an increase in consulting expense of approximately $0.1 million, and an increase in legal expense of approximately $0.1 million.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources     At
September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.6 million. Based on our current operational plan and budget, we expect that it has sufficient cash to manage its business into approximately the first quarter of 2018, although
this estimation assumes we do not accelerate the development of our existing product candidate, acquire other drug development opportunities, or otherwise face unexpected events, costs or contingencies, any of which could affect our cash
requirements. Available resources may be consumed more rapidly than anticipated, potentially resulting in the need for additional funding. Additional funding from any source (including equity and debt financings) may be unavailable on favorable
terms, if at all.

  Not included in the foregoing estimate of the timing for the availability of existing cash
reserves is the potential that we might be required to use cash to pay payroll tax upon the vesting of certain RSUs in 2017 in the event there is not a cash buyer for the portion of those stock awards sufficient to cover the payroll tax
liability. Such payment could significantly reduce our cash resources and possibly require us to raise new funding earlier than expected in order to fund planned operations as projected.  

Item 3.  
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       None.  

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the  Certifying Officers ), conducted evaluations of our disclosure controls and procedures. As defined under Sections 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the  Exchange Act ), the term  disclosure controls and procedures  means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including the Certifying Officers,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.    Based on this evaluation, the Certifying Officers have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.     Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the first nine months of 2016 that materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls   
 Readers are cautioned that our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial
reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our control have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any control design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
    CAUTIONARY NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   
 Certain information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including in Item 2,  Management s Discussion and Analysis

uncertainties, including those detailed in our filings with the SEC. Actual results, including, without limitation: (i) the results of our collaboration with Mayne Pharma, (ii) the application and availability of corporate funds and our
need for future funds, or (iii) the timing for completion, and results of, scheduled or additional clinical trials and the FDA s review and/or approval and potential commercial launch of our products and product candidates and regulatory
filings related to the same, may differ significantly from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements also involve other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to materially

period to reporting period. Such factors include, among others, those listed under Item 1A of our 2015 Annual Report and other factors detailed from time to time in our other filings with
the SEC. Although management believes that the assumptions made and expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, there is no assurance that the underlying assumptions will, in fact, prove to be correct or that actual
future results will not be different from the expectations expressed in this Report. We undertake no obligation to publically update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as
