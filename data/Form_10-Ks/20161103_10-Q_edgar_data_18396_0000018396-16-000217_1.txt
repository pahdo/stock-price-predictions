Note About Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q (including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, from time to time, we and our representatives may make statements that are forward-looking. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including, but not limited to, statements about our plans, strategies, adequacy of resources and future financial results (such as revenue, gross profit, operating profit, cash flow, and tax rate), are forward-looking statements. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by words like      anticipates,           believes,           expects,           may,           will,           could,           should,           intends,           plans,           estimates      and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Because these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: weakness or volatility in general economic conditions and levels of capital spending by clients in the industries we serve, including as a result of the U.S. elections; weakness or volatility in the financial and capital markets, which may result in the postponement or cancellation of our clients' projects or the inability of our clients to pay our fees; the termination of one or more major client contracts or projects; the uncertain timing and funding of new contract awards and renewals; a high concentration of our business with a few large clients; the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses with CDI; the inability to obtain favorable price and other terms for any acquisitions and divestitures we may do; delays or reductions in U.S. government spending; credit risks associated with our clients; competitive market pressures; foreign currency fluctuations; restrictions on the availability of funds and on our activities under our asset-based, secured credit facility; the availability, retention and cost of qualified labor; our level of success in attracting, training, and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; changes in tax laws and other government regulations, including the impact of health care reform laws and regulations; the possibility of incurring liability for our business activities, including, but not limited to, the activities of our professional employees and our temporary employees; our performance on client contracts; negative outcome of pending and future claims and litigation; improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential company, client, government, employee or candidate information, including personal data; and government policies, legislation or judicial decisions adverse to our businesses. More detailed information about these and other risks and uncertainties may be found in our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), particularly in the  Risk Factors  section in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We assume no obligation to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.  
  Unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to  CDI,  the "Registrant,  the "Company,   we,   us  or  our  are to CDI Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries  .

1.    Business  
    
  CDI Corp. and its subsidiaries (the  Company  or  CDI ) seek to create extraordinary outcomes with its clients by delivering solutions based on highly skilled and professional talent. CDI s business is comprised of four segments: Enterprise Talent, Specialty Talent and Technology Solutions, Engineering Solutions and Management Recruiters International (MRI). CDI s client offerings include an array of engineering design project solutions, information technology project solutions and managed services, specialty technology staff augmentation, and program and managed staffing services. CDI's clients are corporations in multiple industries, including energy, chemicals, infrastructure, aerospace, industrial equipment, technology, as well as municipal and state governments, and the United States (U.S.) Department of Defense. CDI has offices and delivery centers in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, CDI provides recruiting and staffing services through its global MRINetwork        of franchisees. 
    
  In September 2016, the Company approved a restructuring plan to further align its organizational structure, facilities and resource utilization with business volumes and strategic direction. See Note     6   Restructuring and Other Related Costs. 
    
  On September 16, 2016, CDI completed the sale of CDI AndersElite Limited, the Company's United Kingdom (UK) staffing and recruitment business included in the Enterprise Talent reporting segment. The Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include the results of CDI AndersElite Limited for the period prior to disposition. See Note     7 Acquisitions and Dispositions. 
    
  On September 16, 2016, the Company announced that Scott Freidheim, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), resigned from the Company effective September 15, 2016, and Michael Castleman, CDI s Chief Financial Officer, was elected as President of the Company and agreed to serve as interim CEO. 

2.    Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation  
    
  Principles of Consolidation   - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CDI Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  
    
  Basis of Presentation   - The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial reporting. These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 3, 2016. Results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full year. 

3.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
    
  Use of Estimates   - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts disclosed in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
    
  Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the assumptions used in the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, impairment assessment of goodwill, determination of the recoverability of long-lived assets, assessment of legal contingencies and calculation of income taxes. 
    
  Reclassifications   - Certain historical financial information in the prior period consolidated financial statements has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Historical segment financial information has been reclassified as a result of an operational realignment plan adopted in December 2015. This reclassification did not impact any previously reported consolidated revenues, gross profit or results of operations. See Note 12-Reporting Segments.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09 (Topic 606)   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , and most industry-specific revenue guidance in addition to some cost guidance. ASU 2014-09 establishes a five-step model under the core principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company may apply this guidance using either a full retrospective approach, subject to certain practical expedients, or a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of initial application. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date that allows the Company to defer the effective date to January 1, 2018 but still permit the Company to adopt the standard as of the original January 1, 2017 effective date. In 2016, the FASB issued two amendments that are effective as of the effective date selected for the original standard. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements, but has determined that it will utilize the deferred effective date of January 1, 2018 to adopt the standard.  
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation   (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   (ASU 2015-02). The standard changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a variable interest entity (VIE), and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 during the first quarter of 2016, which adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which supersedes ASC 840,   Leases   (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change the lessees  recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard. Lessors  accounting is largely unchanged from the previous accounting standard. In addition, ASU 2016-02 expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. Lessees and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not determined the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 makes several modifications to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 during the first quarter of 2016, which adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after  December 15, 2018. The Company has not determined the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows   (Topic 320):   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   (ASU 2016-15)  .   ASU 2016-15 clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments should be presented in the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods with retrospective application for all periods presented. The Company has not determined the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

4.    Fair Value Disclosures  
    
  The Company maintains a non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for highly compensated employees. The assets of the plan are held in the name of CDI at a third-party financial institution. Separate accounts are maintained for each participant to reflect the amounts deferred by the participant and all earnings and losses on those deferred amounts. The assets of the plan are held in publicly traded mutual funds. The fair value of the plan assets is calculated using the market price of the mutual funds as of the end of the period. 
    
  The following tables summarize the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level of the fair value hierarchy for the indicated periods: 

(1)   
    As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $1.2 million   and   $7.2 million   are included in  Prepaid expenses and other current assets  (liability offset in  Other accrued expenses and other current liabilities ) and  Other non-current assets  (liability offset in  Deferred compensation ), respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets reflecting the non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan assets. 

(1)   
    As of December 31, 2015,   $0.9 million   and   $7.5 million   are included in  Prepaid expenses and other current assets  (liability offset in  Other accrued expenses and other current liabilities ) and  Other non-current assets  (liability offset in  Deferred compensation ), respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets reflecting the non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan assets.

5.    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  
    
  The following table summarizes the changes in the Company's carrying value of goodwill by reporting segment for the indicated periods: 

The Company performs its annual assessment for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets using a measurement date of July 1 of each fiscal year. The Company performs an assessment for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is below its carrying value.  
    
  The Company performed its annual assessment as of July 1, 2016 and determined that the fair values for each of the Company's reporting units were substantially in excess of their related carrying values. The Company estimated the fair values of all reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy. The key assumption used to determine the fair values was management's estimate of future earnings. The Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and used reasonable assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If actual future results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, the Company may have to take impairment charges in the future. 
    
  The following tables summarize the changes in the Company's carrying value of other intangible assets during the indicated periods: 

6.    Restructuring and Other Related Costs 
    
  In September 2016, the Company approved a restructuring plan (the  2016 Restructuring Plan ) to further align its organizational structure, facilities and resource utilization with business volumes and strategic direction. The 2016 Restructuring Plan is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2016 with certain payments related to the consolidation of facilities expected through 2018. 
    
  In December 2015, the Company approved a restructuring plan (the  2015 Restructuring Plan ) to better align its organization and operations with the Company's strategy. The 2015 Restructuring Plan was substantially completed during 2016 with certain payments related to the consolidation of facilities expected through 2022.

In December 2014, the Company approved a restructuring plan (the  2014 Restructuring Plan ) to optimize its operations and facility footprint. The 2014 Restructuring Plan was substantially complete during 2015 with certain payments related to the consolidation of facilities expected through 2019 and certain employee severance expected through 2016.  
    
  The following table summarizes the provision, activity and balances related to the Restructuring Plans by cost type for the indicated periods: 

The consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   include provisions related to the foregoing restructuring plans of   $4.2 million   and   $4.1 million   in  Other accrued expenses and other current liabilities , and   $1.3 million   and   $1.0 million   in "Other non-current liabilities", respectively. 

7.    Acquisition and Dispositions 
    
  EdgeRock Technologies, LLC Acquisition 
  On October 6, 2015, the Company acquired EdgeRock Technologies, LLC (EdgeRock), a provider of ERP and other specialist IT staffing, including business intelligence and data analytics, for cash consideration of   $33.4 million  , including a working capital adjustment that was paid in 2016, plus up to an additional   $4.0 million   of cash contingent on EdgeRock's operating performance for the twelve months ending October 31, 2016. EdgeRock currently comprises the Specialty Talent business within the Specialty Talent and Technology Solutions reporting segment. During the   first three months   of   2016  , the Company recorded a benefit of   $0.8 million   to "Operating and administrative expenses" in the consolidated statements of operations related to the reversal of the estimated contingent earnout liability. 
    
  CDI AndersElite Limited Disposition 
  On September 16, 2016, the Company completed the sale of CDI AndersElite Limited (Anders), the Company's UK-based staffing and recruitment business in the Enterprise Talent  reporting segment, to AndersElite Holdings Ltd. (Holdings), an entity controlled by certain members of Anders' management. The Company received purchase consideration that included    4.5 million   cash,    1.75 million   subordinated debt in Holdings and warrants representing   19.99%   of the fully diluted equity in Holdings. The Company valued the non-cash purchase consideration at    0.5 million   and recorded it to "Other non-current assets" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded a loss of   $11.3 million   to "Loss on disposition of business interests" in the consolidated statements of operation related to the disposition of Anders. Anders does not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation under ASU 2014-08; accordingly, Anders' results are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within continuing operations. See Note 12     Reporting Segments, for Anders summarized results included in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
    
  CDI-Pycopsa Disposition 
  On March 20, 2015, the Company completed the sale of its   67%   interest in CDI-Pycopsa Ingenier a y Construcci n, S. de R.L. de C.V. ( CDI-Pycopsa ), a Mexico-based engineering design company in the Engineering Solutions (formerly GETS) reporting segment. CDI-Pycopsa does not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation under ASU 2014-08, which was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2015. Accordingly, CDI-Pycopsa's results are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within continuing operations. Excluding the   $0.3 million   loss on disposition, CDI-Pycopsa's pretax results

attributable to CDI were not material for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company received   $0.1 million   of proceeds related to the sale. 

8.    Credit Facility  
    
  On October 30, 2015, the Company and certain domestic subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the  U.S. Borrowers ), certain Canadian subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, the "Canadian Borrowers"), and certain UK subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, the "UK Borrowers"), collectively (the "Borrowers") entered into an agreement for a secured lending facility (the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. and other lenders. The Credit Agreement established a   $150.0 million   revolving line of credit facility which also includes an option to expand the facility by up to   $75.0 million   subject to agreement by the lenders, with a   five  -year term ending on   October 30, 2020  . In connection with the sale of Anders, the Company executed an amendment to the Credit Agreement to release all liens and security interests on the UK collateral and allocate the available UK borrowings to the U.S. Borrowers. As of   September 30, 2016  , the facility is comprised of two subfacilities with   $135.0 million   available to the U.S. Borrowers and   $15.0 million   available to the Canadian Borrowers. It also includes a   $25.0 million   sublimit for swing line loans and a   $15.0 million   sublimit for letters of credit.  
    
  Availability under the Credit Agreement is tied to a borrowing base, measured by   85%   of eligible billed accounts receivable, plus   80%   of eligible unbilled accounts receivable, less customary reserve amounts; provided however that the portion of the borrowing base consisting of   80%   of eligible unbilled accounts receivable may not exceed   30%   of the sum of (i)   85%   of the eligible billed accounts receivable, plus (ii)   80%   of the eligible unbilled accounts receivable. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used by the Company and the other Borrowers for general business purposes including capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions and investments. Accounts receivable, used in the determination of the borrowing base, are subject to lender discretion and, in certain circumstances, the lender may use cash balances in a dominion account established with the administrative agent to repay outstanding balances. As a result, amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement are presented as current in the consolidated balance sheets.   
    
  The Borrowers  obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first lien security interest in all of the Borrowers  personal property (subject to customary exceptions), including, among other things, accounts receivable, equity interests, deposit accounts, intellectual property, and leased properties where books and records are kept. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had total outstanding borrowings of   $15.0 million  , letters of credit outstanding of   $3.3 million   and   $110.4 million   available to borrow under the Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . Interest was payable at a rate of   1.77%   per annum for outstanding borrowings as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had total outstanding borrowings of   $18.8 million  , letters of credit outstanding of   $3.3 million   and   $120.7 million   available to borrow under the Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of   December 31, 2015  . 

9.    Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Although management cannot predict the timing or outcome of these matters with certainty, management does not believe that the final resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

10.    Income Taxes  
    
  The Company calculates an effective income tax rate each quarter using the estimated annual effective rate method based upon forecasted annual income by jurisdiction, statutory tax rates and other tax-related items. The impact of discrete items is recognized in the interim period in which they occur. Discrete items and the mix of domestic and foreign pre-tax income and losses with no tax benefit may significantly impact the interim period income tax provision and increase the volatility of the interim period effective tax rate at low levels of pre-tax results. 
    
  A valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on an assessment of positive and negative evidence, including estimates of future taxable income necessary to realize future deductible amounts. In the fourth quarter of 2015 the company booked a valuation allowance against federal deferred tax assets due to cumulative losses.

In connection with the sale of Anders, the Company will take a   $19.1 million   worthless stock deduction associated with CDI AndersElite Limited on its 2016 U.S. federal income tax return, which will be treated as an ordinary loss for tax purposes. This loss will result in a deferred tax asset of   $6.6 million  , which can be carried forward for up to 20 years and used against future taxable income. There is no net income tax benefit related to this item due to the full valuation allowance against federal deferred tax assets. 
  The effective tax rates for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   (4.2)%   and   (4.1)%  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was impacted by U.S. and certain foreign losses that do not generate tax benefits in the current period as the benefits are fully offset by valuation allowances. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was   (4.1)%   was impacted by discrete items, the mix of domestic and foreign pre- tax income and certain foreign losses with no tax benefit. 
    
  Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. Management s assessment is made for each taxpayer on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. A full valuation allowance has been recorded against the deferred tax asset related to federal taxes and part of the group s U.S. state taxes as these are not more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased or decreased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.  

11.    Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) Data  
    
  The following table reconciles the denominator used to compute basic EPS to the denominator used to compute diluted EPS for the indicated periods: 

There were   0.5 million   shares and   0.7 million   shares excluded from the computation of EPS for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. There were   0.5 million   shares and   0.4 million   shares excluded from the computation of EPS for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  

12.    Reporting Segments 
    
  During December 2015, the Company adopted a plan to deliver improved performance and efficiencies through increased strategic focus and operational realignment. As a result of this realignment, certain historical segment financial information has been reclassified to conform to the current period segment presentation that became effective during the first quarter of 2016. This reclassification did not impact any previously reported consolidated revenues, gross profit or results of operations.

  Third Quarter 2016 Overview 
  Revenue during the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased by   $24.4 million   or   10.0%   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   primarily due to decreases in Enterprise Talent and Engineering Solutions, partially offset by an increase in Specialty Talent and Technology Solutions. Enterprise Talent revenue decreased primarily due to reduced staffing volumes at a large information technology client as well as reduced UK staffing revenue in part associated with the disposition of CDI AndersElite Limited prior to the end of the quarter and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Engineering Solutions revenue decreased primarily due to decreases in EC I and, to a lesser extent, AIE. Specialty Talent and Technology Solutions revenue increased primarily due to the inclusion of EdgeRock, which was acquired on October 6, 2015. Gross profit   decreased   by   $6.3 million     primarily due to the decrease in revenue and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in gross profit margin in each reporting segment, partially offset by a shift in revenue mix to higher margin Specialty Talent and Technology Solutions business as a result of the inclusion of EdgeRock. Operating and administrative expenses were reduced in response to lower business volumes and reduced corporate costs partially offset by the inclusion of EdgeRock. For the third quarter of 2016, the Company reported an operating loss of   $17.9 million   compared to an operating loss of   $22.1 million   in the prior year period and a net loss attributable to CDI of   $17.8 million   compared to   $20.2 million   in the prior year period, respectively. 
  In September 2016, the Company approved a restructuring plan (the  2016 Restructuring Plan ) to further align its organizational structure, facilities and resource utilization with business volumes and strategic direction. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a charge of   $3.5 million   to "Restructuring and other related costs" in the consolidated statement of operations. The 2016 Restructuring Plan is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2016 with certain payments related to the consolidation of facilities expected through 2018.  
  On September 16, 2016, the Company completed the sale of CDI AndersElite Limited (Anders), the Company's UK-based staffing and recruitment business in the Enterprise Talent  reporting segment, to AndersElite Holdings Ltd., an entity controlled by certain members of Anders' management. The Company recorded a loss of   $11.3 million   to "Loss on disposition of business interests" in the consolidated statements of operation related to the disposition of Anders. See Note     7 Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q Report. 
  On September 16, 2016, the Company announced that Scott Freidheim, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), resigned from the Company effective September 15, 2016, and Michael Castleman, CDI s Chief Financial Officer, was elected as President of the Company and agreed to serve as interim CEO.

  The following table presents changes in revenue by segment along with selected financial information for the indicated periods: 

NM - Not meaningful. 
  Revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in Enterprise Talent and Engineering Solutions, partially offset by an increase in Specialty Talent and Technology Solutions. Enterprise Talent revenue decreased primarily due to reduced staffing volumes at a large information technology client, reduced Canadian pipeline staffing and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as well as reduced UK staffing revenue in part associated with the disposition of Anders prior to the end of the quarter. Engineering Solutions revenue decreased primarily due to decreases in EC I and, to a lesser extent, AIE. Specialty Talent and Technology Solutions revenue increased primarily due to the inclusion of EdgeRock, which was acquired on October 6, 2015, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in Technology Solutions. MRI revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease in royalties and, to a lesser extent, contract staffing revenue, partially offset by an increase in franchise fees. 
  Gross profit decreased primarily due to the decrease in revenue and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in overall gross profit margin in each of the reporting segments, partially offset by a shift in revenue mix to higher margin Specialty Talent and Technology Solutions business as a result of the inclusion of EdgeRock.  
  Excluding the   $11.3 million   loss on disposition in 2016 and   $21.5 million   impairment charge in 2015, operating results decreased primarily due to the decrease in gross profit and an increase in restructuring and other related costs, partially offset by reductions in operating and administrative expenses. Operating and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to actions taken by the company to reduce personnel-related and other costs in response to lower business volumes, reduced corporate costs, and the disposition of the UK Staffing business on September 16, 2016, partially offset by the inclusion of EdgeRock. Corporate operating costs decreased primarily due to reduction in prior costs associated with international business development activities. 
  Income tax expense   increased     $1.0 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The effective income tax rate for the   third   quarter of   2016   was impacted by U.S. and certain foreign losses that do not generate tax benefits in the current period as the benefits are fully offset by valuation allowances. The effective income tax rate for the   third   quarter of   2015   was impacted by discrete items, the mix of domestic and foreign pre-tax income and certain foreign losses with no benefit. As such, comparison of effective tax rates for the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   is not meaningful. See Note 10   Income taxes  , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q Report for more information.

  The following table presents changes in revenue by segment along with selected financial information for the indicated periods: 

NM - Not meaningful. 
  Revenue   decreased   due to a decrease in Enterprise Talent, Engineering Solutions and MRI, partially offset by an increase in Specialty Talent and Technology Solutions. Enterprise Talent revenue decreased primarily due to reduced staffing at a large information technology client, reduced Canadian pipeline staffing, the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and reduced UK Staffing revenue, in part due to the disposition of the UK Staffing business on September 16, 2016. Engineering Solutions revenue decreased primarily due to decreases in EC I and AIE, partially offset by an increase in Government Services. Specialty Talent and Technology Solutions revenue increased primarily due to the inclusion of EdgeRock and, to a lesser extent, an increase in Technology Solutions. MRI revenue decreased due to a decrease in royalties and contract staffing revenue, partially offset by an increase in franchise fees. 
  Gross profit   decreased   primarily due to the decrease in revenue as overall gross profit margin remained flat. Overall gross profit margin remained flat as decreases in Enterprise Talent, Engineering Solutions and Technology Solutions gross profit margins were offset by a shift in revenue mix to higher margin Specialty Talent and Technology Solutions business, primarily as a result of the inclusion of EdgeRock.  
  Excluding the   $11.3 million   loss on disposition in 2016 and   $21.5 million   impairment charge in 2015, operating results decreased primarily due to the decrease in gross profit and an increase in restructuring and other related costs and operating and administrative expenses. Operating and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the inclusion of EdgeRock. Excluding EdgeRock, operating and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to actions taken by the company to reduce personnel-related and other costs in response to lower business volumes, reduced corporate costs, and the disposition of the UK Staffing business on September 16, 2016. Corporate operating costs decreased primarily due to a reduction in prior costs associated with international business development activities. 
  Income tax expense   increased     $0.4 million   during the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to the   first nine months   of   2015  . The effective income tax rate for the   first nine months   of   2016   was impacted by U.S. and certain foreign losses that do not generate tax benefits in the current period as the benefits are fully offset by valuation allowances. The effective income tax rate for the   first nine months   of   2015   was impacted by discrete items, the mix of domestic and foreign pre-tax income and certain foreign losses with no tax benefit. As such, comparison of effective tax rates for the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to the   first nine months   of   2015   is not meaningful.

     NM - Not meaningful. 
    
  Revenue   decreased   in both the North America and UK Staffing businesses. North America Staffing revenue decreased primarily due to reduced staffing volumes at a large information technology client, reduced spend at several large U.S. staffing programs and discrete client projects, partially offset by growth at a large engineering client. UK Staffing revenue decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the disposition of the UK Staffing business on September 16, 2016 and reductions across the engineering and construction sectors, in part associated with the uncertainty following the Brexit referendum.  
    
  Gross profit   decreased   primarily due to the decrease in revenue and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin decreased primarily due to a shift in mix to North American Staffing, in part associated with the disposition of the UK Staffing business on September 16, 2016, as well as negative pricing pressure, particularly in Canadian pipeline staffing. 
    
  Operating and administrative expenses   decreased   primarily due to actions taken by the Company to reduce personnel-related and other costs in response to lower business volumes, the disposition of the UK Staffing business on September 16, 2016 and, to a lesser extent, the reversal of bad debt reserves from earlier in 2016. 
    
  Excluding the   $11.3 million   loss on disposition in 2016 and   $10.7 million   impairment charge in 2015, both related to the UK staffing business, operating results decreased due to the reduction in gross profit, partially offset by the decrease in operating and administrative expenses.

  Excluding the   $11.3 million   loss on disposition in 2016 and   $10.7 million   impairment charge in 2015, both related to the UK staffing business, operating results decreased primarily due to the reduction in gross profit, partially offset by the decrease in operating and administrative expenses.

  The following table presents changes in revenue by category along with selected financial information for the indicated periods: 

(1)   
    In the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a charge of   $10.9 million   related to the impairment of goodwill and certain fixed assets within the EC I business.  
     NM - Not meaningful. 
    
  Revenue   decreased   in EC I and AIE, partially offset by an increase in Government Services. The decrease in EC I is primarily due to reduced demand for engineering services by downstream and midstream clients as a result of the completion of several large projects as well as the impact of the decline in oil and gas prices on new spending. The decrease in AIE revenue is primarily due to reduced spending by a large commercial aviation client and, to a lesser extent, the wind down of the Company's data acquisition and analysis business during 2015. The slight increase in Government Services is primarily due to growth in existing naval defense contracts. 
    
  Gross profit decreased primarily due to a reduction in revenue and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin decreased primarily due to deterioration in margin of certain fixed price contracts in EC I and reduction in AIE margins associated with the wind down of the Company's data acquisition and analysis business during 2015. 
    
  Operating and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to actions taken by the Company to reduce personnel-related and other costs in response to lower business volumes, partially offset by an increase in reserves for project-related disputes.  
    
  Excluding the   $2.5 million   restructuring charge in 2016 and   $10.9 million   impairment charge in 2015, operating results decreased primarily due to a reduction in gross profit, partially offset by the decrease in operating and administrative expenses.

     NM - Not meaningful. 
    
  Revenue   decreased   in EC I and AIE, partially offset by an increase in Government Services. The decrease in EC I is primarily due to reduced demand for engineering services by downstream and midstream clients as a result of the completion of several large projects as well as the impact of the decline in oil and gas prices on new spending. The decrease in AIE revenue is primarily due to reduced spending by a large commercial aviation client. The increase in Government Services is primarily due to new naval defense contracts. 
    
  Gross profit   decreased   primarily due to a reduction in revenue and, to a lesser extent, a slight reduction in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin decreased slightly primarily due to a reduction in AIE margins associated with the wind down of the Company's data acquisition and analysis business during 2015 and the effect of an increase in pass-through materials revenue in Government Services. 
    
  Operating and administrative expenses   decreased   primarily due to actions taken by the Company to reduce personnel-related and other costs in response to lower business volumes and wind down of the Company's data acquisition and analysis business during 2015, partially offset by an increase in reserves for project-related disputes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under credit facilities. The Company's principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and debt service. Management expects that the Company's current cash balances, cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to support the Company's working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. 
    
  On October 30, 2015, the Company and several of its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Borrowers ) entered into a secured lending facility (the  Credit Agreement ) with Bank of America, N.A. and other lenders. The Credit Agreement established a   $150.0 million   revolving line of credit facility which also includes an option to expand the facility by up to   $75.0 million   subject to agreement by the lenders, with a   five  -year term ending on   October 30, 2020  . In connection with the sale of Anders, the Company executed an amendment to the Credit Agreement to release all liens and security interests on the UK collateral and allocate the available UK borrowings to the U.S. Borrowers. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used by the Borrowers for general business purposes including capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions and investments. See Note 8     Credit Facility  , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q Report for more information relating to the Credit Agreement. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had total outstanding borrowings of   $15.0 million   and letters of credit outstanding of   $3.3 million   under the Credit Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of   $10.2 million   and   $110.4 million   is available to borrow under the Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately 84% of the Company's cash and cash equivalents were held by certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, principally by Canadian entities and denominated in Canadian dollars. The repatriation of cash and cash equivalent balances from non-U.S. subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, such cash and cash equivalent balances are generally available, without legal restrictions, to fund ordinary business operations at the local level. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the unremitted earnings of such non-U.S. subsidiaries because it is management's intention to reinvest such earnings in non-U.S. subsidiaries for the foreseeable future. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents   decreased   from   $16.9 million   on   December 31, 2015   to   $10.2 million   on   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  On January 25, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (the "Stock Repurchase Program"). Under the Stock Repurchase Program, CDI is authorized to repurchase up to $20 million of its common stock from time to time and at prices considered appropriate by the Company. Repurchases have been and may be made via privately negotiated transactions, open market purchases, block trades or by other means at management's discretion in compliance with applicable securities laws. The timing of repurchases and number of shares of common stock to be purchased will depend upon market conditions and other factors. The Company is not required to repurchase any specific number of shares and the Stock Repurchase Program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Through   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   1,190,356   shares for   $7.3 million   in cash under the Stock Repurchase Program. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $12.7 million   remained authorized for repurchase of shares. During the month of October 2016, the Company did not repurchase any shares under the Stock Repurchase Program. 
    
  The following table summarizes the net cash flows, by category, from the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows for the indicated periods: 

Operating Activities 
  For the   first nine months   of   2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $6.5 million  , an increase in net cash provided by operating activities of   $4.1 million   as compared to   2015  . The increase in net cash provided by operations is primarily due to decreased working capital requirements partially offset by lower net income and non-cash items. Working capital requirements on a comparative basis were impacted by the timing of receipts and payments that include a generation of cash from accounts

  (  Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated  ) 

receivable and accounts payable and the receipt of a federal tax refund in 2016, partially offset by payroll-related requirements due to the timing of pay cycles. 
  Investing Activities  
  For the   first nine months   of   2016  , the Company used   $3.1 million   net cash in investing activities, which is a   $1.8 million   decrease from the comparable period in   2015  . The decrease in the use of cash is due the net proceeds of   $5.7 million   related to the sale of the Company's UK-based staffing and recruitment business, partially offset by the payment of a working capital adjustment of   $2.1 million   related to the EdgeRock Technologies, LLC acquisition and, to a lesser extent, the   2015   receipt of   $1.2 million   in proceeds from the sale of a non-operating corporate asset. 
    
  Financing Activities 
  For the   first nine months   of   2016  , net cash used in financing activities was   $10.3 million   compared to net cash used in financing activities of   $6.1 million   during the comparable period in   2015  . The increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to the stock repurchased under the Stock Repurchase Program and the net repayments under the Company's credit facility, and is partially offset by the elimination of the Company's dividend. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts disclosed in this Form 10-Q Report. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain accounting policies, methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from current judgments. 
  The critical accounting estimates and assumptions identified in the Company's 2015 annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 3, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission have not materially changed. 

Item 3.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  The Company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company monitors this risk to limit the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates on earnings and cash flows. 
    
  Foreign Currency Risk 
  The Company's exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates primarily to its operations denominated in Canadian dollars. Exchange rate fluctuations impact the U.S. dollar value of reported earnings derived from these foreign operations as well as the Company's investment in the net assets related to these operations. The sale of Anders, the Company's UK-based staffing and recruitment business, on September 16, 2106, significantly reduced the Company's exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions denominated in British pounds sterling. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
  The interest rate risk associated with the Company's borrowing activities as of   September 30, 2016   was not material in relation to its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While it may do so in the future, the Company has not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of its debt instruments. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had total outstanding borrowings of   $15.0 million   with interest payable at rates during the period of   1.77%   per annum.

Item 4.        Controls and Procedures  
    
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
  The management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date to provide reasonable assurance that information reported in this Form 10-Q Report is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
  There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the Company's   third   quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.        Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Although management cannot predict the timing or outcome of these matters with certainty, management does not believe that the final resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
  There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the  Risk Factors  section (Part I, Item 1A) of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

  Stock Repurchase Program 
  On January 25, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (the "Stock Repurchase Program"). Under the Stock Repurchase Program, CDI is authorized to repurchase up to $20 million of its common stock from time to time and at prices considered appropriate by the Company. Repurchases have been and may be made via privately negotiated transactions, open market purchases, block trades or by other means at management's discretion in compliance with applicable securities laws. The timing of repurchases and number of shares of common stock to be purchased will depend upon market conditions and other factors. The Company is not required to repurchase any specific number of shares and the Stock Repurchase Program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, suspended or discontinued. 
    
  A total of   1,190,356   shares of CDI Corp. common stock were repurchased by the Company at an average price of   $6.09   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and there remained an outstanding authorization to repurchase approximately   $12.7 million   of outstanding stock as represented in the table below:

Exhibit 10.2 

Change to Director Compensation 

As part of their compensation for service on the Board of Directors of CDI Corp. (the  Company ), each non-employee director of the Company receives, at the beginning of the one-year period between annual meetings of the shareholders of the Company, a grant of shares of Time-Vested Deferred Stock (TVDS).  The shares of TVDS vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, at which time they are converted into an equivalent number of shares of CDI common stock.  Prior to May 2016, the value of the annual TVDS grant to each non-employee director was $100,000.  In May 2016, the Board approved an amendment to this arrangement, imposing a cap of 10,000 shares of TVDS for each annual grant to a director.  Under this amendment, the number of shares of TVDS to be granted to each director annually will equal to the lesser of (a) $100,000 divided by the market price of CDI stock on the date of grant and (b) 10,000 shares.  This change went into effect with the May 2016 TVDS grants to directors, with the result that the number of shares of TVDS awarded to each director was limited to 10,000.  The closing price on the date of grant was $5.64 and, accordingly, the grants had an award date value of $56,400 as compared to $100,000.

  CERTIFICATION  
  I, Michael S. Castleman, certify that:  
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of CDI Corp.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  
       
           (a) 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  
              (b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  
              (c) 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and  
              (d) 
    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           (a) 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
