SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

(UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1- NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Ionix Technology, Inc. (the  Company ), formerly known as Cambridge Projects Inc., is a Nevada corporation that was formed on March 11, 2011.  By and through its wholly owned subsidiaries, the Company develops, designs, manufactures and sells lithium batteries for electric vehicles in China.

On May 19, 2016, the Company, as the sole member of Well Best International Investment Limited ( Well Best ), formed Xinyu Ionix Technology Company Limited ( Xinyu Ionix ), a company formed under the laws of China. As a result Xinyu Ionix is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Well Best and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Between May 19, 2016 and August 19, 2016, the date the Board ratified the incorporation, Xinyu Ionix conducted no business. Xinyu Ionix will focus on developing and designing lithium batteries as well as to act as an investment company that may acquire other businesses located in China

NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has not generated income from its operations and had an accumulated deficit of $243,082 at September30, 2016. These circumstances, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

The Company expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future and may need to raise additional capital from external sources or obtain loans from officers and shareholders in order to continue the long-term efforts contemplated under its business plan. The Company is in the process of reevaluating its current marketing strategy as it relates to the sale of its current product line. In addition, the Company is pursuing other revenue streams which could include strategic acquisitions or possible joint ventures of other business segments.

NOTE 3  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of presentation 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the interim financial statements related to these periods are unaudited. The results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent periods or for the entire year ending June 30, 2017 or for any subsequent periods. The balance sheet at June 30, 2016 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and regulations. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended June 30, 2016 as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on October 11, 2016.

Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation

F-5 

Impairment of long-lived assets 

In accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360,  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , all long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.

Revenue recognition 

In accordance with the ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, transfer of title has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.

The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of finished products upon delivery to the customer, whereas the title and risk of loss are fully transferred to the customers. The Company records its revenues, net of value added taxes ( VAT ). The Company is subject to VAT which is levied on the majority of the products at the rate of 17% on the invoiced value of sales.

Foreign currencies translation 

Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.

The reporting currency of the Company is the United States Dollar ("US$"). The Company's subsidiaries in the People s Republic of China ( PRC ) maintain their books and records in their local currency, the Renminbi Yuan ("RMB"), which is the functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which these entities operate.

In general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30,  Translation of Financial Statement , using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. Stockholders  equity is translated at historical rates. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders  equity.

The exchange rates used to translate amounts in RMB into U.S. Dollars for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements are as follows:

There were no foreign operations during the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts and retention receivable, prepayments and other receivables, accounts payable, income tax payable, other payables and accrued liabilities approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.

Management believes, based on the current market prices or interest rates for similar debt instruments, the fair value of short-term bank borrowings and note payable approximate the carrying amount.

F-6 

The Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ("ASC 820-10"), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level 1: Inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets;

Level 2: Inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. Black-Scholes Option-Pricing model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs; and

Level 3: Inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

NOTE 4  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On February 8, 2012, the Company obtained exclusive licensing rights of the QI System from Quadra International Inc. ( Quadra ), the manufacturer of the QI System, to sub-license, establish joint ventures to commercialize, use and process organic waste, and sell related by-products in the states of Johore and Selangor, Malaysia for a period of 25 years.  The QI System processes organic waste to marketable by-products and is proprietary technology. This business was terminated on November 15, 2015.The Company has excluded results of QI system operations from its continuing operations to present this business in discontinued operations.

The following table shows the results of operations for fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 which are included in the loss from discontinued operations for the termination of QI System:

On August 19, 2016, Well Best entered into a share transfer agreement whereby Well Best sold 100% of its equity interest in Taizhou Ionix Technology Co. Ltd. ( Taizhou Ionix ) to Mr. GuoEn Li, the sole director and officer of Taizhou Ionix  for     approximately RMB 30,000 (approximately $5,000USD). Well Best was the sole shareholder of Taizhou Ionix. The Company believed that the manufacturing contract between Taizhou Ionix and Taizhou Jiunuojie Electronic Technology Limited regarding the production of lithium batteries was not beneficial to the Company. As a result, (i) Taizhou is no longer an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and (ii) Mr. Li is no longer affiliated with the Company. Well Best recorded a gain of $24,364 on disposal of Taizhou Ionix which was recorded in the account of   additional paid in capital. 

F-7 

The following table shows the results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 which are included in the loss from discontinued operations for the disposal of Taizhou Ionix:

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, Xinyu Ionix advanced $913,380 (RMB 6,092,243) to Mr. Nan .  There was no formal agreement between the Company and Mr. Nan. The amounts are non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on demand.

From October 1 to November 7, 2016, Mr. Nan made payments to suppliers of Xinyu Ionix for approximately RMB 3,000,000 (approximately $450,000) for settlement of account payable on behalf of Xinyu Ionix. The repayment of the unpaid balance of approximately $460,000 was guarenteed by Mr. Ben Wong, who is the sole owner of the Company s major shareholder, Shining Glory Investments Limited.

Supplier who accounted for 10% or more of the Company s total purchases (materials and services) and its outstanding balance as of September30, 2016, are presented as follows:

All suppliers of the Company are located in the PRC.

NOTE 8- INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate in the years presented is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rate. The Company operates in various countries: United States of America Hong Kong and the PRC that are subject to taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate, as follows:

United States of America 

The Company is registered in the State of Nevada and is subject to the tax laws of United States of America.

The Company has shown losses since inception.  As a result it has incurred no income tax. Under normal circumstances, the Internal Revenue Service is authorized to audit income tax returns during a three year period after the returns are filed.  In unusual circumstances, the period may be longer.  Tax returns for the years ended June 30, 2011 to 2014 were still exposed to audit as of June 30, 2016.

The Company received a penalty assessment from the IRS in the amount of $10,000 for failure to provide information with respect to certain foreign owned US Corporations on Form 5472 - Information Return of a 25% Foreign Owned US Corporation for the tax period ended June 30, 2013. The Company disputed this claim and is working to reverse the penalty. The Company believes that the payment of this penalty is remote and did not accrue this liability as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Hong Kong 

The Well Best is registered in Hong Kong and for the three months ended September30, 2016, there is no assessable income chargeable to profit tax in Hong Kong.

The PRC 

The Company's subsidiaries, Taizhou Ionix and Xinyu Ionix, are subject to the Corporate Income Tax Law of the People s Republic of China at a unified income tax rate of 25%.

The reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. statutory rate of 35% to the Company's effective tax rate is as follows:

F-9 

The Company has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to be reinvested indefinitely. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, interest associated with unrecognized tax benefits is classified as income tax and penalties are classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations.

The extent of the Company s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.

NOTE 9  STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY

On August 19, 2016, Well Best sold 100% of its ownership in Taizhou Ionix to Mr. GuoEn Li, the sole director and officer of Taizhou Ionix for RMB30,000 (approximately $5,000) and recorded a gain of $24,364 which was recorded in the account of additional paid in capital. See Note 4 for more details.

We will require approximately $150,000 to fund our working capital needs for the year ending June 30, 2017 as follows:

Future Financings

We will not consider taking on any long-term or short-term debt from financial institutions in the immediate future.   We are dependent upon our director and the major shareholder to provide continued funding and capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our plan of operations.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606. This Update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The guidance in this Update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to illustrate the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements that will provide users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a reporting organization s contracts with customers. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016 for public companies and 2017 for non-public entities. Management is evaluating the effect, if any, on the Company s financial position and results of operations. 

14 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
