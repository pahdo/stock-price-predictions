      Table of Contents             FREEZE TAG, INC.    (A DELAWARE CORPORATION)    Notes to Condensed Financial Statements    Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016    (Unaudited)       NOTE 1   THE COMPANY      Freeze Tag, Inc. (the  Company ) is a leading creator of mobile social games that are fun and engaging for all ages. Based on a free-to-play business model that has propelled games like Candy Crush Saga to worldwide success, the Company employs state-of-the-art data analytics and proprietary technology to dynamically optimize the gaming experience for revenue generation. Players can download and enjoy the Company s games for free, or they can purchase virtual items and additional features within the game to increase the fun factor. The Company s games encourage players to compete and engage with their friends on major social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.       NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN      As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred net losses of $1,628,305 and $1,469,973 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s accumulated deficit was $10,612,815. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 3l, 2015, the Company experienced negative cash flows from operations largely due to its continued investment spending for product development of game titles for smartphones and tablets that are expected to benefit future periods. Those facts, along with our lack of access to a significant bank credit facility, create an uncertainty about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the Company is currently evaluating its alternatives to secure financing sufficient to support the operating requirements of its current business plan, as well as continuing to execute its business strategy of distributing game titles to digital distribution outlets, including mobile gaming app stores, online PC and Mac gaming portals, and opportunities for new devices such as tablet (mobile internet device) applications, mobile gaming platforms and international licensing opportunities.     The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its success in securing sufficient financing and in successfully executing its plans to return to positive cash flows during fiscal 2016. The Company s financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if it were unable to continue as a going concern.      NOTE 3     ACCRUED EXPENSES      Accrued liabilities consisted of the following at:                        7        
      Table of Contents          Accrued royalties consist of amounts owed to other parties with whom the Company has revenue-sharing agreements or from whom it licenses certain trademarks or copyrights.     Unearned royalties consist of royalties received from licensees, which have not yet been earned. Unearned royalties were $191,347 and $195,033 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.     As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had technology payable of $18,000 resulting from a technology transfer agreement with an unrelated party entered into in June 2011, payable in 24 installments of $1,500 without interest.       NOTE 4     DEBT       Notes Payable      On February 1, 2016, the Company entered into a Game Marketing Agreement with an investor whereby the investor agreed, at its option, to loan up to $250,000 (the  Marketing Fund ) to the Company to exclusively fund user acquisition efforts for the game Kitty Pawp (the  Game ). The investor will receive 50% of Net Receipts (as defined in the agreement) from the Game until the Marketing Fund is fully recouped. Once the Marketing Fund is recouped, the investor will receive 50% of Net Receipts from the Game until the investor receives a 50% return on the Marketing Funds advanced.     The Company has recorded Marketing Fund advances as notes payable in the accompanying condensed balance sheets. Upon receiving a Marketing Fund advance, the Company accrues the 50% return as interest expense and includes the obligation in accrued interest payable in the accompanying condensed balance sheets. As of September 30, 2016, total advances recorded as notes payable were $58,096 and accrued interest payable included a total of $22,046 of the 50% guaranteed return, net of repayments.      Convertible Notes Payable   Related Party      Convertible notes payable, related party consisted of the following at:           The  Holland Family Trust Convertible Note  is convertible into Company common stock at the greater of (i) the Variable Conversion Price and (ii) the Fixed Conversion Price. The  Variable Conversion Price  shall mean 50% multiplied by the Market Price (representing a discount rate of 50%).

Fixed Conversion Price  shall mean $0.00005.                   8        
      Table of Contents          The Company evaluated the Holland Family Trust Convertible Note and determined that the shares issuable pursuant to the conversion option were determinate due to the Fixed Conversion Price and, as such, does not constitute a derivative liability as the Company has obtained authorization from a majority of shareholders such that should conversion occur at the Fixed Conversion Price the appropriate number of shares will be available or issuable for settlement to occur. The note payable is convertible into common stock at the discretion of the Holland Family Trust. Furthermore, at any time, the Company may pay the balance of the unconverted note payable in cash.      As of September 30, 2014, $72,107 of accrued interest was added to the note principal and $813,602 of the note was transferred to Craig Holland. A new convertible note for $222,572 was issued to the Holland Family Trust with the same terms as the previous note, with the exception of the maturity date, which was extended to December 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued interest related to the Holland Family Trust Convertible Note was $44,530 and $27,867, respectively.     On September 30, 2014, $813,602 principal balance (including interest) of the Holland Family Trust Convertible Note was transferred to Craig Holland (the  Holland Transferred Convertible Note ).

The Holland Accrued Salary Note and the Donahoo Accrued Salary Note are convertible into Company common stock at the greater of (i) the Variable Conversion Price and (ii) the Fixed Conversion Price.

Market Price  means the average of the three lowest trading prices for the Company s common stock during the twenty-five (25) trading-day period ending on the latest complete trading day prior to the Conversion Date.  Fixed Conversion Price  shall mean $0.00005.      The Company evaluated the Holland Accrued Salary Note and the Donahoo Accrued Salary Note and determined that the shares issuable pursuant to the conversion option were determinate due to the Fixed Conversion Price and, as such, the conversion feature does not constitute a derivative liability as the Company has obtained authorization from a majority of shareholders such that should conversion occur at the Fixed Conversion Price the appropriate number of shares will be available or issuable for settlement to occur. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was $51,248 and $37,290, respectively, of accrued interest related to each of the notes.     On December 31, 2013, the Company converted a note payable to Mick Donahoo of $55,250 and accrued interest of $15,399 into a new convertible related party note in the amount of $70,649 (the  Mick Donahoo Convertible Note ).

The Mick Donahoo Convertible Note and the Craig Holland Convertible Note are convertible into Company common stock at the greater of (i) the Variable Conversion Price and (ii) the Fixed Conversion Price. The  Variable Conversion Price  shall mean 50% multiplied by the Market Price (representing a discount rate of 50%).  Market Price  means the average of the three lowest trading prices for the Company s common stock during the twenty-five (25) trading-day period ending on the latest complete trading day prior to the Conversion Date.  Fixed Conversion Price  shall mean $0.00005.                  9        
      Table of Contents          The Company evaluated the Mick Donahoo Convertible Note and the Craig Holland Convertible Note and determined that the shares issuable pursuant to the conversion option were determinate due to the Fixed Conversion Price and, as such, does not constitute a derivative liability as the Company has obtained authorization from a majority of shareholders such that should conversion occur at the Fixed Conversion Price the appropriate number of shares will be available or issuable for settlement to occur. The agreements modified the debt to make it convertible into common stock of the Company. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was accrued interest payable related to these notes totaling $7,989 and $5,146, respectively.

On October 8, 2015, Mick Donahoo converted $4,607 principal and $2,028 accrued interest into 12,637,860 shares of the Company's common stock.     Effective October 15, 2015, the Company entered into an Amendment to Convertible Promissory Note with each of Craig Holland and Mick Donahoo with respect to the Craig Holland Convertible Note and the Mick Donahoo Convertible Note. The parties agreed to modify the terms of the notes such that in the event the lender issues a valid conversion notice and the conversion notice results in a conversion price less than the then-par value of the Company's common stock, the conversion will be effected at par value with additional principal amounts added to the note equal to the value of the common shares that were not able to be issued due to the conversion price being less than the par value of the Company's common stock. As the amendment did not alter the shares received by converting the notes, no additional value was recorded by the Company as a result of these amendments.     Total accrued interest payable for the related party convertible notes was $317,791 and $209,461 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

The Convertible Cowdell Note is convertible into Company common stock at the greater of (i) the Variable Conversion Price and (ii) the Fixed Conversion Price.

The Company evaluated the Convertible Cowdell Note and determined that the shares issuable pursuant to the conversion option were determinate due to the Fixed Conversion Price and, as such, does not constitute a derivative liability as the Company has obtained authorization from a majority of shareholders such that should conversion occur at the Fixed Conversion Price the appropriate number of shares will be available or issuable for settlement to occur. The agreement modified the debt to make it convertible into common stock of the Company.

NOTE 5   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS      The Company adopted FASB ASC 820 on October 1, 2008. Under this FASB, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Under GAAP, certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value, and FASB ASC 820-10-50 details the disclosures that are required for items measured at fair value.           The Company has various financial instruments that must be measured under the new fair value standard including: cash and debt. The Company currently does not have non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows:     Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. The fair value of the Company s cash is based on quoted prices and therefore classified as Level 1.     Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).     Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.     Cash, accounts receivable, capitalized production costs, prepaid royalties, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued compensation, accrued royalties, accrued interest, accrued expenses, unearned royalties, notes payable   related party and technology payables reported on the balance sheet are estimated by management to approximate fair market value due to their short term nature.     The following tables provide a summary of the fair values of liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:                  NOTE 6   DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS      As discussed in Note 4, the Company issued convertible notes payable to non-related parties that contain anti-dilutive, or down round, price protection. Pursuant to ASC 815-15 Embedded Derivatives and ASC 815-40 Contracts in Entity s Own Equity, the Company recorded a derivative liability for the price protection provisions issued within the convertible debt transactions.     The fair values of the Company s derivative liabilities are estimated at the issuance date and are revalued at each subsequent reporting date using a multinomial lattice model simulation discussed below. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded current derivative liabilities of $1,625,117 and $841,677, respectively. The net change in fair value of the derivative liabilities resulted in a loss of $592,785 and $398,509 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and a gain of $145,300 and a loss of $75,222 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, which are reported as other income (expense) in the statements of operations.           The following table presents details of the Company s derivative liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:           The Company calculated the fair value of the compound embedded derivatives using a multinomial lattice model simulation. The model is based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model using projections of the various potential outcomes.     Key inputs and assumptions used in valuing the Company s derivative liabilities are as follows for issuances of notes:               Stock prices on all measurement dates were based on the fair market value            Down round protection is based on the subsequent issuance of common stock at prices less than the conversion feature            The probability of future financing was estimated at 100%            Computed volatility ranging from 258% to 271%     See Note 5 for a discussion of fair value measurements.      NOTE 7   STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT       Stock Issuances      The Company is authorized to issue up to 2,000,000,000 shares of its $0.00001 par value common stock, and up to 10,000,000 shares of its $.001 par value preferred stock.     As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had common stock payable of $16,800 resulting from a technology transfer agreement with an unrelated party that obligated the Company to issue a total of 96,000 shares of its common stock, payable in 8 quarterly installments of 12,000 shares.      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued a total of 188,954,515 shares of its common stock to accredited investors in conversion of $22,405 principal and $5,308 accrued interest payable at a conversion prices ranging from $0.00005 to $0.00045 per share and settled $42,365 of derivative liabilities. As a result of the debt conversions and derivative settlement, common stock was increased by $1,890 and additional paid-in capital was increased by $68,188.      2006 Stock Option Plan      The 2006 Stock Option Plan was adopted by our Board of Directors in March of 2006. A total of 550,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance to employees, consultants and directors upon exercise of incentive and non-statutory options and stock purchase rights which may be granted under the Company s 2006 Stock Plan (the  2006 Plan ). On October 15, 2009, 235,000 of those options were exercised, leaving 315,000 shares available for issuance to employees. Because of the 5.31-for-one forward stock split of the Company s common stock on October 15, 2009, there are now 1,512,650 shares available for issuance as a part of this stock plan. As of September 30, 2016, there were 560,000 options outstanding to purchase shares of Common Stock, and no shares of Common Stock had been issued pursuant to stock purchase rights under the 2006 Plan.           Under the 2006 Plan, options may be granted to employees, directors, and consultants. Only employees may receive  incentive stock options,  which are intended to qualify for certain tax treatment, and consultants and directors may receive  non-statutory stock options,  which do not qualify for such treatment. A holder of more than 10% of the outstanding voting shares may only be granted options with an exercise price of at least 110% of the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, and if such holder has incentive stock options, the term of the options must not exceed five years.     Options and stock purchase rights granted under the 2006 Plan generally vest ratably over a four year period (typically 1 4 or 25% of the shares vest after the 1st year and 1/48 of the remaining shares vest each month thereafter); however, alternative vesting schedules may be approved by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. Any unvested portion of an option or stock purchase right will accelerate and become fully vested if a holder s service with the Company is terminated by the Company without cause within twelve months following a Change in Control (as defined in the 2006 Plan).     All options must be exercised within ten years after the date of grant. Upon a holder s termination of service for any reason prior to a Change in Control, the Company may repurchase any shares issued to such holder upon the exercise of options or stock purchase rights. The Board of Directors may amend the 2006 Plan at any time. The 2006 Plan will terminate in 2016, unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors.     The Company did not grant any stock options or warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and did not record any stock-based compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     A summary of the status of the options and warrants issued by the Company as of September 30, 2016, and changes during the nine months then ended is presented below:            NOTE 8   LOSS PER COMMON SHARE      The computation of basic earnings per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted earnings per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average common stock equivalents which would arise from the exercise of stock options, warrants and rights outstanding using the treasury stock method and the average market price per share during the period.     For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the diluted weighted average number of shares is the same as the basic weighted average number of shares as the conversion of debt, options and warrants would be anti-dilutive.             NOTE 9   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      The Company had convertible notes payable to related parties totaling $1,447,041 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. See Note 4 for a detailed disclosure of this related party debt, including interest rates, terms of conversion and other repayment terms. Accrued interest payable to related parties was $317,791 and $209,461 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

The amendments in this ASU include specific guidance on eight statement of cash flows classification issues, thereby reducing the current and potential future diversity in related financial reporting practice. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently unable to determine the impact on our financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement.      NOTE 11   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company issued a total of 92,882,698 shares of common stock in the conversion of convertible notes payable principal totaling $5,818 and accrued interest payable totaling $1,363.     On October 11, 2016, we received additional proceeds of $50,000 from the April 7, 2016 Convertible Promissory Note to an Accredited Investor. The note bears interest at 10% per annum and matures 12 months from its effective date.               ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Our Management s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.     Although the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Statement reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.     The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, its unaudited condensed financial statements and related notes located elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.      Summary Overview      Freeze Tag, Inc. is a leading creator of mobile social games that are fun and engaging for all ages. Based on a free-to-play business model that has propelled games built and marketed by some of our competitors to worldwide success, we employ state-of-the-art data analytics and proprietary technology to dynamically optimize the gaming experience for revenue generation. Players can download and enjoy our games for free, or they can purchase virtual items and additional features within the game to increase the fun factor. Our games encourage players to compete and engage with their friends on major social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.     During our most recent fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, we generated revenues of $15,969 from the sales our games or in-app purchases in our games compared to $7,542 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated revenues of $62,794 compared to $23,068 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Going forward, with our shift to free-to-play games, we anticipate the vast majority of our revenue in future years will be derived from consumers making in-game purchases in one of our free-to-play games and that revenue from consumers paying to download a game will be minimal.     During the quarter, we launched several updates and events to our most popular title, Kitty Pawp: Bubble Shooter, including introducing new content (Kitty skins) and new challenge levels. These events have proven popular with our most loyal Kitty Pawp players.      In August of 2016, we announced a change in our company strategy to release more products. We have adjusted our strategy to put the company in a better position to compete in a mobile game market dominated by large multinational companies. Our new game release strategy will vary from the past in three important ways.             First of all, we will focus on less crowded sub-genres within the mobile gaming market such as word and trivia games. Secondly, we are moving to a more rapid launch cycle with multiple games of varying themes and styles published over the course of a year. Thirdly, we are adjusting our monetization strategy to focus on advertising by delivering more ad impressions in our new games. Our games will still include in app purchase options and players will always have an opportunity to pay to have ads removed.     As we develop and publish these new games, we will build our own network of games through which we can cross promote and launch new titles which will enable us to lower our user acquisition costs and more efficiently monetize new games. We will continue to support and develop Kitty Pawp and Black Forest and use this new game release strategy to build the player base for our existing titles.     During the quarter, we launched Word Quest and Word Witch word games on both iOS and Android platforms as we begin to roll out this new strategy. In Q4, we plan to launch several new games in the trivia, word, and casual puzzle categories.      We remain intent on growing the company through acquisition, and during the quarter we continued to have discussions with prospective acquisition targets and consultants who may lead us to prospective targets. We feel that the time is right to build an alliance of companies in the digital entertainment business who can become stronger and more successful by working together to build a company that can leverage market intelligence, development expertise and cross-promotional opportunities to achieve great results for our customers and shareholders.     During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reported a net loss of $984,867 and $1,628,305, respectively, primarily attributable to continued high levels of interest expense and losses on the change in our derivative liabilities, as discussed below.      Going Concern Uncertainty      As shown in the accompanying financial statements, we incurred net losses of $1,628,305 and $1,469,373 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s accumulated deficit was $10,612,815. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 3l, 2015, the Company experienced negative cash flows from operations largely due to its continued investment spending for product development of game titles for smartphones and tablets that are expected to benefit future periods. Those facts, along with our lack of access to a significant bank credit facility, create an uncertainty about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the Company is currently evaluating its alternatives to secure financing sufficient to support the operating requirements of its current business plan, as well as continuing to execute its business strategy of distributing game titles to digital distribution outlets, including mobile gaming app stores, online PC and Mac gaming portals, and opportunities for new devices such as tablet (mobile internet device) applications, mobile gaming platforms and international licensing opportunities.     Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our success in securing sufficient financing and in successfully executing its plans to return to positive cash flows during fiscal 2016. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if it were unable to continue as a going concern.      Results of Operations        Revenues      Our revenues increased $8,427 to $15,969 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $7,542 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased $39,726 to $62,794 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $23,068 mainly due to increased in-game purchases from the players of our  Kitty Pawp  title. Our revenues also increased due to positive results of our focused efforts on building games in the free-to-play game genre. Previously, the majority of our released game titles were "pay-per-download", where the consumer paid to download the game onto their device, leading to revenue per download. Now our games are free to download and play, but have built-in features that require the consumer to pay if they want to access the feature, which means our revenue is tied to when the consumer pays to access the features, if they do. Our revenue can typically fluctuate based on when we release our games and the popularity of the games we release.              Operating Costs and Expenses      Our cost of sales decreased $22,909 to $68,486 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $91,395 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased $117,280 to $215,484 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $332,764 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to fewer new titles that we have in development. Our cost of sales includes royalties, subcontractors and internal costs of programming, analytics, and design .      Our selling, general and administrative expenses were relatively constant compared to the prior year periods. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5,556 to $124,424 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $129,980 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased $3,033 to $417,553 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $414,520 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       Other Income (Expense)      Our interest expense increased $10,165 to $215,225 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $225,390 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased $12,564 to $657,271 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $669,835 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we continued to increase our convertible debt and the related debt discount that is amortized to interest expense. However, the increased interest expense attributable to the new debt was offset by decreased interest expense attributable to prior years' debt resulting from debt discount being fully amortized in prior periods.     Our estimate of the fair value of the derivative liability for the conversion feature of our convertible notes payable is based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility, and variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective loan agreements. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability will fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuation may be material. We reported a loss on change in derivative liabilities of $592,785 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and a gain on change in derivative liabilities of $145,300 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We reported a loss on change in derivative liabilities of $398,509 and $75,222 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      Net Loss      As a result of the above, our net loss increased to $984,867 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $293,923 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased to $1,628,305 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,469,673 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.      Liquidity and Capital Resources       Introduction      As of September 30, 2016, we had current assets of $27,474 and current liabilities of $6,403,569, resulting in a working capital deficit and a total stockholders  deficit of $6,376,095.                During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, because of our operating losses, we did not generate positive operating cash flows. Our cash balance as of September 30, 2016 was $22,257, and our current monthly operating cash flow burn rate is approximately $64,000. As a result, we have significant short-term cash needs. These needs are currently being satisfied primarily from the proceeds from short-term convertible debt. We intend to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt from third parties and other related parties until such time as our cash flows from operations will satisfy our cash flow needs. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.      Sources and Uses of Cash      We used net cash of $576,891 in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of our net loss of $1,628,305 and a decrease in unearned royalties of $3,686, partially offset by non-cash expenses totaling $780,430, decreases in accounts receivable, net of $3,732 and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $804, and increases in accounts payable of $59, accrued expenses of $1,727, accrued interest payable   related party of $108,330 and accrued interest payable of $160,018.     By comparison, we used net cash of $723,306 in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of our net loss of $1,469,674 and decreases in accrued expenses of $4,518 and unearned royalties of $5,708, partially offset by non-cash expenses totaling $551,201, decreases in accounts receivable, net of $7,428 and prepaid and other current assets of $3,477, and increases in accounts payable of $1,515, accrued interest payable   related party of $108,920 and accrued interest payable of $84,053.     We had no net cash provided by or used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     We had net cash provided by financing activities of $557,096 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, comprised of proceeds from notes payable of $58,096 and proceeds from convertible notes payable of $499,000. Net cash provided by financing activities was $738,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, comprised of proceeds from convertible notes payable.       Notes Payable      On February 1, 2016, we entered into a Game Marketing Agreement with an investor whereby the investor agreed, at its option, to loan us up to $250,000 (the  Marketing Fund ) to exclusively fund user acquisition efforts for the game Kitty Pawp (the  Game ). The investor will receive 50% of Net Receipts (as defined in the agreement) from the Game until the Marketing Fund is fully recouped. Once the Marketing Fund is recouped, the investor will receive 50% of Net Receipts from the Game until the investor receives a 50% return on the Marketing Funds advanced.     We recorded Marketing Fund advances as notes payable in the accompanying condensed balance sheets. Upon receiving a Marketing Fund advance, we accrue the 50% return as interest expense and includes the obligation in accrued interest payable in the accompanying condensed balance sheets. As of September 30, 2016, total advances recorded as notes payable were $58,096 and accrued interest payable included a total of $22,046 of the 50% guaranteed return, net of repayments.      Convertible Note Payable      On April 7, 2016, we entered into a Convertible Promissory Note (the "Note") with an accredited investor (previously defined as "Accredited Investor #2") under which Accredited Investor #2 agreed to loan us up to $500,000. The Note had an outstanding balance of $369,000 at September 30, 2016 and was funded by tranches of $60,000 in April 2016, $45,000 in May 2016, $55,000, $27,000 and $10,000 in June 2016, $48,000 and $24,000 in July 2016, $50,000 in August 2016 and $50,000 in September 2016. The note is convertible into Company common stock at the lesser of (i) the Variable Conversion Price and (ii) the Fixed Conversion Price. The  Variable Conversion Price  shall mean 50% multiplied by the Market Price (representing a discount rate of 50%).  Market Price  means the average of the three (3) lowest trade prices on three (3) separate trading days of Common Stock recorded after the original Effective Date of the note.  Fixed Conversion Price  shall mean $0.003. The note also includes conversion price reset features that are triggered when the Company issues certain new equity instruments; as a result, this feature caused the Company to consider this feature a derivative liability. The maturity date of the note is one year from the date of funding.              Debt Instruments, Guarantees, and Related Covenants      We have no disclosures required by this item.      Critical Accounting Policies      The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs, expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are often based on historical experience and judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made. However, all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and actual results may differ. For further information on our significant accounting policies see the notes to our condensed financial statements included in this filing and Note 2 to our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no changes to our significant accounting policies since December 31, 2015.       ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures        (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined) in Exchange Act Rules 13a   15(c) and 15d   15(e). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who are our principal executive officer and principal financial officers, respectively, concluded that, as of the end of the three month period ended September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to us, including our chief executive and chief financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.       (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting      There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.             PART II   OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings       We are not a party to or otherwise involved in any legal proceedings.     In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. The litigation process is inherently uncertain and it is possible that the resolution of such matters might have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. However, in the opinion of our management, other than as set forth herein, matters currently pending or threatened against us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.       ITEM 1A. Risk Factors       As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds       During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had the following unregistered sales of equity securities:     As discussed in detail above, on April 7, 2016, we entered into a Convertible Promissory Note (the "Note") with an accredited investor (previously defined as "Accredited Investor #2") under which Accredited Investor #2 agreed to loan us up to $500,000. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we received the following tranches under the Note: $48,000 and $24,000 in July 2016, $50,000 in August 2016 and $50,000 in September 2016. Based on the representations of the investors in the Note, the tranches were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. The investors were accredited and sophisticated, familiar with our operations, and there was no solicitation.     During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued a total of 171,803,099 shares of its common stock to two non-affiliate holders of two of our outstanding convertible promissory notes pursuant to notices of conversion submitted to us from the holders notifying us of their election to convert a total of $16,005 principal and $ 3,990 interest due under the promissory notes. Due to the length of time since the holders lent us the funds and that the holders have held the note, the shares were issued without a standard Rule 144 restrictive legend. Based on the representations of the investors in the Convertible Promissory Notes and the Notices of Conversion, the issuance of the shares was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. The investors were accredited and sophisticated, familiar with our operations, and there was no solicitation.       ITEM 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities       There is no information required to be disclosed by this Item.       ITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures       There is no information required to be disclosed by this Item.       ITEM 5. Other Information       On October 19, 2016, we entered into a licensing agreement with Munzee, Inc., allowing us to utilize Munzee s geolocation products in certain augmented reality games we are developing. Under the terms of the agreement we are not required to pay Munzee any up-front compensation for the use of its products, but we must pay them a royalty payment based on any net revenue we receive from games utilizing Munzee s products.             On November 1, 2016, we entered into a licensing agreement with Paws, Incorporated, allowing us to utilize graphic images of the characters in the GARFIELD    comic strip created by Jim Davis, namely  Garfield,   Odie,   Jon,   Arlene,   Nermal,  and  Pooky  in games we are developing. Under the terms of the agreement we are not required to pay Paws any up-front compensation for the use of the images, but we must pay them a royalty payment based on any net revenue we receive from games utilizing the graphic images of the GARFIELD    characters.

Before you may use the Licensed Property (or Paws  Trademarks) in any fashion, you agree to submit to Paws for approval such digital or other materials as Paws may reasonably request. You agree to get Paws' prior written approval for each Licensed Article, as well as Paws' prior written approval of any Collateral Materials for each Licensed Article. All non-English language text and explanatory material must be accompanied by an accurate and complete English language translation.      Upon approval of the prototypes and/or Collateral Materials, you agree that all Licensed Articles sold or distributed shall conform to the approved prototype(s) in all material respects, and that the Collateral Materials will not be modified in any material fashion without the advance consent of Paws.      Paws will respond to your requests for approval as soon as it reasonably can, and in case of disapproval, Paws will explain to you why. Paws will exercise its approval rights in good faith. Paws will have no duty to respond to requests for approval during any period of time that money owed by you to Paws is due and unpaid, or during any period of time that you are otherwise not in compliance with your duties and obligations under this Agreement.      You agree that Paws may require the artwork of the Licensed Property to be updated on any Licensed Articles or Collateral Materials three years after Paws' first approval of the item.      10. (a) Unless Paws gives you permission in writing, all character art and editorial for the Licensed Articles and Collateral Materials must be provided by Paws, and only current art may be used. So long as you are in full compliance with all of your obligations under this Agreement, Paws will allow you access to the Paws Licensing Support Site ("PLSS"). In order to obtain access to the PLSS system, you agree to provide Paws with an email address for the receipt of the information needed to enable you to log-in to PLSS.  You will be responsible for all uses or misuses of the PLSS site by all persons who use your account to access PLSS.  Artwork from PLSS will be made available to you on the same terms as it is generally made available to other Paws' Licensees. If you are unable to use art by downloading from PLSS, Paws will provide you with existing art at its standard rates for reproduction, handling and mailing. All custom art work must be done by Paws (unless you are authorized in writing by Paws), and you will be charged a competitive price.      (b) Paws offers a wide range of creative services ("Creative Services") such as custom art work, design layout, graphic design, writing/editorial, website design/enhancement, and other services. Should you elect to utilize any of the Creative Services, you agree to pay all properly issued invoices in accordance with their terms. Also, before utilizing the results of Creative Services, IT WILL BE YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO ERRORS OR OMISSIONS. If you discover any errors or omissions that were the fault of Paws, Paws will correct the work in the format or medium as originally submitted to you by Paws and without additional expense to you. Beyond this, however, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT PAWS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER TO YOU, OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY, FOR ANY SUCH ERRORS OR OMISSIONS, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS, DAMAGE OR EXPENSE.             (c) If Paws authorizes you to provide creative elements for a Licensed Article or Collateral Materials ("New Works"), such as graphical elements (e.g., portrayals of the Characters, backgrounds, et cetera) or written elements (e.g., gags, slogans, stories, content for speech/thought balloons, et cetera), you hereby assign and transfer to Paws, and you agree to assign and transfer to Paws, without charge, your entire, worldwide right, title and interest in and to the New Works (and elements thereof) including, but not limited to, all copyrights, and you waive and agree to waive all associated moral rights.  New Works  does not include (i) your proprietary software or proprietary software of others that is licensed by you, and (ii) characters created by you and which bear no resemblance to the Characters. If parties who are not your employees living in the United States make or have made any contribution to the creation of the New Works so that such parties might be deemed to be "authors" of the same as that term is used in present or future United States copyright statutes, you agree to obtain from such parties a full assignment of rights so that the foregoing assignment by you shall vest in Paws full rights in the New Works (and all elements thereof) free of any claims, interest, or rights of other parties. At the request of Paws, you agree to furnish Paws with all relevant information concerning the creation of the New Works and copies of assignments of rights obtained from other parties. You agree to execute and cause to be executed such documents as Paws may reasonably request in order to carry out the intent and purpose of this paragraph.      (d) All art which Paws provides to you, in whatever media and for whatever purpose, shall be promptly returned to Paws upon the request of Paws, except for art reasonably required for authorized current production of Licensed Articles. You acknowledge that all such art is proprietary to Paws, may only be used for your authorized activities under this Agreement, and you agree that such art shall not be delivered to or made available for use by any third party.      (e) You agree that you will not, during or after the term of this Agreement, directly or indirectly assert any interest in or property rights in the Licensed Property or the Characters. You further agree that you will not, during or after the term of this Agreement, directly or indirectly contest the validity of the copyrights in the Licensed Property, or Paws' ownership of the copyrights in the Licensed Property. During the term of this Agreement, you agree to conduct all of your activities in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and you also agree to not engage in or sanction any activity within your control which, in the reasonable judgment of Paws, reflects adversely upon Paws, Paws' Trademarks, or the Licensed Property.      11. (a) Paws will obtain in its own name and at its own expense trademark, copyright or other proprietary protection for the Licensed Property or the Licensed Articles and/or Collateral Materials as Paws deems appropriate. You agree that you will not seek or obtain any trademark, copyright or other protection or take any other action which might affect Paws' ownership of any of the rights in the Licensed Property (or Paws  Trademarks). You understand and agree that your use of the Licensed Property (and Paws  Trademarks) and all goodwill arising therefrom shall inure to Paws' exclusive benefit and that you will not acquire any rights by virtue of any use you may make of the Licensed Property (or Paws  Trademarks), other than as specifically set out in this Agreement.      (b) You agree that the Licensed Articles and all Collateral Materials shall bear such copyright and other proprietary rights notices as Paws may direct, and incorporate a Paws  Trademark if requested by Paws. References to website(s) owned or controlled by Paws shall also be included (if practicable) as reasonably directed by Paws.      (c) If Paws thinks it appropriate, you also agree to execute and cause to be executed by your employees and/or contractors such documents as Paws may request to carry out the intent of this paragraph.      (d) With respect to countries which require applications to register a license as a registered user of the Licensed Property, or which have a requirement of a similar nature, you agree to execute, deliver and record at your expense such documents as Paws may reasonably request.      12. (a) You agree that the quality and style of the Licensed Articles as well as the quality and style of all Collateral Materials shall be at least as high as the best quality of similar digital products and promotional and advertising material sold or distributed by you in the Licensed Territory. You also warrant that the Licensed Articles and Collateral Materials: (1) will not infringe upon or violate any rights of any third party; (2) will be of high standard in style, appearance and quality; (3) will be safe for use by consumers and others; (4) will be in compliance with all applicable governmental laws, rules or regulations (including, but not limited to, COPPA); and (5) will not be sold or distributed by you or your customers in any manner or in any place not specifically authorized by this Agreement.             (b) For avoidance of doubt, you understand that Paws does not conduct any trademark search or other inquiry concerning the use of words or images (other than the Licensed Property) on or in connection with the Licensed Articles. Therefore, you agree that Paws will have no liability to you or to others, and you will be solely responsible for, any claim or demand alleging that the use of such words or images (other than the Licensed Property) constitutes an infringement of trademark or other rights purportedly held by a third party, or constitutes unfair competition. You further understand that Paws has no expertise, and relies solely upon you, to competently design, develop and sell Licensed Articles which are safe for use, and suitable for their intended purposes. As such, you agree that you will be solely responsible for any claim or demand alleging that any Licensed Article is unsafe, defective, or otherwise unsuitable, even though Paws has approved the use of the Licensed Property thereon, and even though Paws may have offered suggestions relating to the design, development, or distribution of the Licensed Articles.      13. For avoidance of doubt, the license granted by this Agreement does not include the right to sell, distribute, or offer to sell or distribute, the Licensed Articles (a) in connection with or in relation to the release of a movie featuring the Licensed Property in any format, and whether a theatrical release, or release in any format principally designed for home entertainment, or in any other manner; or (b) in connection with or in relation to a themed attraction, such as a themed restaurant, theme park, themed attraction at a park, et cetera.      14. Within forty-five (45) days after the end of each calendar quarter, you agree to provide Paws with analytics for each Licensed Article sold or distributed in the calendar quarter, together with payment in U.S. Dollars (or a different local currency designated by Paws) of all royalties due on revenues received or credited in such calendar quarter. You agree to provide supporting documentation for the royalties due and owing on account of each Licensed Article, including information for each Licensed Article as to the quantity and gross selling price of each Licensed Article sold or distributed by you during each such period, earned royalties due, the nature and amount of any allowable deductions and/or credits as to each given Licensed Article, and such other information as Paws may reasonably request. Each statement shall be due regardless of whether or not royalties are payable with respect to such period. The reporting and payment period shall be changed from quarterly to monthly upon default by you under this Agreement, unless Paws otherwise agrees in writing.      Should Paws elect to do so during the term of this Agreement or within 2 years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, you agree to allow Paws (or its designee), upon not less than fifteen (15 business days prior notice, access to your books and records (which you agree to maintain and preserve while this Agreement is in effect and for 2 years after expiration or termination of this Agreement) and/or facilities during normal business hours and you agree to cooperate with Paws in conducting an audit of your activities relating to this Agreement. Acceptance by Paws of any statement furnished or royalty paid will not preclude Paws from questioning the correctness thereof. You agree to maintain your internal business records so that Licensed Articles sold by you are conspicuously and readily identifiable as Licensed Articles, and distinguishable from similar items sold by you which do not incorporate elements of the Licensed Property.      You also agree that time is of the essence with respect to all royalty payments to be made under this Agreement, and any other payments owed by you to Paws (such as for Creative Services), and that any sums of money that are owed to Paws by you under this Agreement and not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month. If any audit performed by Paws, or on Paws' behalf, identifies a shortfall of 5% or more in royalties due for any calendar quarter, you agree to reimburse Paws for its reasonable charges and expenses associated with conducting the audit, including but not limited to out of pocket expenses and professional fees paid. If any audit performed by Paws, or on Paws' behalf, identifies an overpayment by you in royalties for any calendar quarter, Paws agrees to reimburse you after first deducting its reasonable charges and expenses associated with conducting the audit, including but not limited to out of pocket expenses and professional fees paid.      All royalty payments and all royalty statements shall be submitted to Paws' Agent, or as may otherwise be directed by Paws in writing.             15. You agree to promptly advise Paws as soon as you become aware of any unauthorized use of the Licensed Property and to reasonably cooperate (without direct expense to you) with Paws in stopping or attempting to stop any such infringing activity. Paws shall have the exclusive right to initiate and pursue any and all legal actions involving the unauthorized use of the Licensed Property.      16. Paws represents to you that it has the exclusive right to grant this license for the Licensed Property to you, and if anyone claims that your use of the Licensed Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement infringes any ownership right or claim of another person, you agree to notify Paws immediately. Paws will then take over the handling of the claim and protect you against monetary losses (but excluding lost profits) that you sustain as a result of such a claim. You agree to reasonably cooperate with Paws in handling and resolving the claim (without direct expense to you), and to do nothing to interfere with the ability of Paws to defend and resolve the same.      17. You agree to defend, indemnify and save Paws harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, judgments, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from any claim or demand made against Paws by any third party and arising from or in connection with the conduct of your business, or your activities under this Agreement (except for claims covered by the preceding paragraph). Your obligation under this paragraph will include any claims or demands arising out of the activities of and/or made by your employees, agents, representatives, distributors, retailers, or manufacturers.      18. [Intentionally deleted.]      19. (a) Paws may, at its option, terminate this Agreement on written notice to you if: (i) you sell or offer to sell any item incorporating elements of the Licensed Property and not included within the description of Licensed Article(s); (ii) you sell or offer to sell any Licensed Article incorporating elements of the Licensed Property which has not been approved in advance by Paws as required by the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) you terminate or suspend your business, you go into either voluntary or involuntary liquidation, or you are subject to insolvency proceedings according to or under the law by which you are governed. Upon termination of this Agreement, all guarantees, nonrefundable advance payments, and accrued royalties shall become immediately due and payable, all licensed rights shall revert to Paws, and Paws shall be entitled to pursue any and all other available remedies.      (b) You shall also be considered in breach of this Agreement if you should fail to: (i) perform any of your other obligations under this Agreement; (ii) perform any of your obligations under any other Agreement that you have with Paws; or (iii) pay when due any invoice issued to you by Paws, and any such failure continues for fifteen (15) days after Paws has notified you in writing of the failure.      (c) If you are in breach of this Agreement, then Paws may, at its option, and upon written notice to you: (i) terminate this Agreement, whereupon all guarantees, and accrued royalties, shall be immediately due and payable; (ii) declare all guarantees immediately due and payable; (iii) suspend the performance of any of its duties, including the right to suspend responding to requests for approvals; and/or (iv) pursue any and all remedies available at law or in equity. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, all rights granted in this Agreement shall revert to Paws, and you agree to immediately stop doing everything relating to the Licensed Articles and the Licensed Property (or Paws  Trademarks), and your registrations (if any) as a registered user of Paws' Trademarks shall be cancelled. Paws will also be entitled to recover all of its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) which it incurs in the event of a breach of this Agreement by you. Written notice under 19(a), (b) or (c) may be given by mail, courier, facsimile transmittal, or email.      (d) Before Paws shall be considered in breach of this Agreement, or as having failed to perform any duty or obligation to you, you must first notify Paws in writing of any such failure, describing the alleged failure with specificity, whereupon Paws shall have a period of fifteen (15) business days to cure or remedy any such failure. If any such failure is not remedied within said fifteen (15) business days, then you are entitled to submit such failure to arbitration as provided in this Agreement; provided, that any such submission must be made within one (1) year of the date of the alleged failure by Paws or your right to seek redress shall be deemed forever barred.             20. Upon the earlier of (i) expiration of this Agreement; (ii) termination of this Agreement; or (iii) regular distributions are no longer being made for a particular Article(s), you agree to deliver to Paws all digital files from which the Licensed Articles and any Collateral Materials were made, together with all original art work, all of which shall be deemed as solely owned by Paws; provided, that the preceding sentence shall not apply to items created by you and which do not incorporate element(s) of the Licensed Property (or Paws  Trademarks) and which are readily distinguishable from the Licensed Property (or Paws  Trademarks). In addition, upon expiration or earlier termination, you agree to terminate all agreements with manufacturers, distributors, and others which relate to the manufacture, distribution, distribution and use of the Licensed Property (or Paws  Trademarks) and/or the Licensed Articles.      21. [Intentionally deleted.]      22. (a) All rights in the Licensed Property not specifically granted to you by the terms of this Agreement are reserved and retained by Paws for its sole use and benefit. (b) You agree that this Agreement does not create a partnership or joint venture between you and Paws, and that you will have no power to obligate or bind Paws in any manner whatsoever. (c) While this Agreement is in effect, you grant permission to Paws to use your name to notify others that you are an authorized GARFIELD Licensee, and to promote the Licensed Articles. (d) Unless you otherwise notify Paws, in writing, Paws will have the right to communicate with you and your employees by way of email communications, including unsolicited email communications relating to Paws or the Licensed Property (such as marketing and informational material).      23. You agree that no waiver by Paws of your failure to perform any of your obligations under this Agreement and/or any material breach of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of a subsequent failure and/or breach. You acknowledge that you have had this Agreement reviewed by your attorney (or have had the opportunity to do so), and that you have had the opportunity to request changes or revisions; accordingly, you agree that any rule of contract interpretation or construction to the effect that ambiguities or uncertainties will be construed against the drafting party shall not be applied to the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.      24. If and to the extent that the laws of any governmental authority limit the enforceability of any territorial restrictions contained in this Agreement, you agree that such provisions shall be deemed modified so as to be compatible with applicable law. In any event, you agree that you will not actively solicit distributions of any Licensed Articles outside the Licensed Territory without Paws' prior written consent. If you receive a request for export to a country outside the Licensed Territory, you agree to inform Paws prior to exportation.      25. Any statement by Paws or any of its employees or representatives as to future events, predictions or the like shall not constitute a warranty or representation or a legally binding commitment unless such statement is specifically included within the written terms of this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Paws and supersedes all prior discussions and agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof. You agree that this Agreement will be controlled by the laws of the State of Indiana, regardless of the place or places of its physical execution and performance. This Agreement is prepared in the English language and the English version will prevail over any foreign translation. This Agreement may only be modified in writing, signed by both parties. If any term or provision is declared invalid, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Each party agrees to notify the other of any change in mailing address or change in operational personnel.             26. The following paragraphs of this Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1, 3, 5, 6(c), 10-14, 16-21, 23, 25, and 26.
