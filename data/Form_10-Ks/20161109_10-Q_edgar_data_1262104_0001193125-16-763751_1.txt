   MEI PHARMA, INC.   
    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
 (Unaudited)     Note 1. The Company   
 MEI Pharma, Inc., or  the Company , is an oncology company focused on the clinical development of novel therapies for cancer. The
Company s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol  MEIP .    The Company s business purpose
is the development of drugs for the treatment of cancer. The Company s portfolio of drug candidates includes Pracinostat, an oral histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor being developed in combination with azacitidine for the treatment
of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) who are     75 years of age or unfit for intensive chemotherapy, and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). In August
2016, the Company entered into an exclusive worldwide license, development and commercialization agreement with Helsinn Healthcare SA, a Swiss pharmaceutical corporation ( Helsinn ) for Pracinostat in AML, MDS, and other potential
indications ( Helsinn License Agreement ). The Company s clinical development portfolio also includes ME-401, an oral inhibitor of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) delta currently in a Phase Ib study in patients with
recurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) or follicular non-Hodgkin s lymphoma ( fNHL ), and ME-344, a mitochondrial inhibitor currently in an investigator-sponsored study in combination with bevacizumab for the
treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 )-negative breast cancer. The Company owns exclusive worldwide rights to ME-401 and ME-344.  
  Basis of Presentation     The accompanying
unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and
Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying financial
statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) that are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The Company has evaluated subsequent
events through the date the financial statements were issued.    The accompanying unaudited financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K ( 2016 Annual Report ) filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on September 9, 2016. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.     Use of
Estimates     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and disclosures made in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. The Company uses estimates that affect the reported amounts (including assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses) and related disclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an adjustment of $1.0 million to reduce accrued expenses related to clinical
trials that were at or near completion for Pracinostat and ME-344 to reflect revised amounts expected to be invoiced upon final billing from third party vendors.  
  Revenue Recognition     The Company may
generate revenues from licensing technology rights and from the conduct of research and development activities as part of the Helsinn License Agreement. The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the Company s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  
 Payments received under commercial arrangements, such as licensing technology rights, may include non-refundable fees at the inception of the
arrangements, milestone payments for specific achievements designated in the agreements, and royalties on the sale of products. The Company considers a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of accounting under its license
agreements, including whether the various elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting. Deliverables under an arrangement will be separate units of accounting, provided (i) a delivered item has value
to the customer on a standalone basis; and (ii) the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company s
control.         Multiple Element Arrangements       
 The Company accounts for revenue arrangements with multiple elements by separating and allocating consideration according to the relative
selling price of each deliverable. If an element can be separated, an amount is allocated based upon the relative selling price of each element. The Company determines the relative selling price of a separate deliverable using the price it charges
other customers when it sells that element separately. If the element is not sold separately and third party pricing evidence is not available, the Company will use its best estimate of selling price.

   License Fee Revenue   
 The Company defers recognition of non-refundable upfront license fees if it has continuing performance obligations, without which the licensed
data, technology, or product has no utility to the licensee separate and independent of its performance under the other elements of the applicable arrangement. Non-refundable, up-front fees that are not contingent on any future performance by the
Company and require no consequential continuing involvement on the Company s part are recognized as revenue when the license term commences and the licensed data, technology or product is delivered. The specific methodology for the recognition
of the revenue is determined on a case-by-case basis according to the facts and circumstances of the applicable agreement.     Research
and Development Revenue     Research and development revenue represents ratable recognition of fees allocated to research and development
activities in accordance with the Helsinn License Agreement. The Company defers recognition of research and development revenue until the performance of the related research and development activities has occurred.  
  Cost of Research and Development Revenue   
 Cost of research and development revenue primarily includes internal compensation and related personnel expenses to support our research and
development revenue and external costs paid to third-party contractors to perform research, conduct clinical trials and develop and manufacture drug materials.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements     In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The standard provides companies with a single model for
accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The core principle of the model is to recognize revenue when control of the goods or
services transfers to the customer, as opposed to recognizing revenue when the risks and rewards transfer to the customer under the existing revenue guidance. The guidance permits companies to either apply the requirements retrospectively to all
prior periods presented, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Deferral of the Effective Date , which defers the required adoption date of ASU 2014-09
by one year. As a result of the deferred effective date, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company in its first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date of the new standard of the first
quarter of fiscal 2018. The following ASUs were subsequently issued by the FASB to clarify the implementation guidance in some areas and add practical expedients: In March 2016, ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Principal
versus Agent Considerations ; in April 2016, ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ; in May 2016, ASU 2016-11,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers and
Derivatives and Hedging Rescission of SEC Guidance ; and ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients . The Company is in the process of evaluating the transition method
that will be elected and the impact of adoption on its financial statements.    In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). The standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of
an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. Certain
disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after
December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Subsequent to adoption, the Company will apply the guidance in ASU 2014-15 to assess its ability to continue as a going concern.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by
lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all
leases with terms longer than 12 months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the
adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the
statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this
standard will have on our financial statements.

  In June 2016, the FASB issued No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments  Credit Losses
(Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . Topic 326 amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost
basis, Topic 326 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current U.S. GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that
is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current U.S. GAAP, however Topic
326 will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. ASU 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The
amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to
receive cash. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its
financial statements.     Note 2. Helsinn License Agreement   
 In August 2016, the Company entered into the Helsinn License Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Helsinn is granted a worldwide
exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pracinostat, and is primarily responsible for funding its global development and commercialization. As compensation for such grant of rights, the Company received a $15.0 million
upfront payment in August 2016, and will receive a $5.0 million payment upon the earlier of (i) dosing of the first patient in the upcoming Phase III study of Pracinostat in newly diagnosed AML patients who are     75 years of age or
unfit to receive induction therapy or (ii) March 1, 2017. The Company will also receive reimbursement related to agreements entered into by MEI in anticipation of the upcoming Phase III study of Pracinostat by Helsinn as well as a Phase II
study for Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of high and very high risk MDS, which will be conducted by MEI. The current expected external cost of the Phase II study will be shared equally by Helsinn and the Company.
Enrollment in the Phase II study is anticipated to commence in the first half of calendar year 2017. The Company will be eligible to receive up to $444 million in potential regulatory and sales-based milestones, along with royalty payments on
the net sales of Pracinostat.    The Company has determined that the exclusive license, development and commercialization agreement
represents a multiple-element arrangement for purposes of revenue recognition. Revenue related to the license will be recognized upon completion of the technology and data transfer, which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of
fiscal year 2017. Revenue related to research and development elements of the arrangement will be recognized ratably over the period of each research and development activity. Revenue associated with third-party costs will be recognized on a gross
basis as such costs are incurred.    Contemporaneously with the Helsinn License Agreement, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase
Agreement (the  Helsinn Equity Agreement ), dated as of August 5, 2016, with Helsinn Investment Fund SA (the  Purchaser ). Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Agreement, the Purchaser agreed to purchase and the Company
agreed to issue a number of shares of the Company s common stock determined by dividing $5,000,000 by the volume weighted-average price for shares of the Company s common stock for the ten trading day period beginning on August 1,
2016 and ending on August 12, 2016 (the  VWAP ), rounded to the nearest whole share. The VWAP was $1.911 per share. Accordingly, on August 16, 2016, the Company issued 2,616,431 shares of common stock. The difference between the
VWAP price of $1.911 per share and the closing price of the Company s common stock on August 5, 2016 of $1.61 of $788,000 has been allocated to the revenue elements.  
  Note 3. Net Loss Per Share     Basic and
diluted net loss per share are computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less any shares subject to repurchase or forfeiture. There were no shares of common stock subject to repurchase or
forfeiture for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.    Because the Company is in a net loss position, it has excluded
stock options, unvested RSUs and warrants from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because these securities are antidilutive for all periods presented. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the number of securities excluded from the
computation of diluted net loss per share totaled 8,389,808 and 6,543,678, respectively.     Note 4. Commitments and Contingencies   
 The Company has contracted with various consultants and third parties to assist it in pre-clinical research and development and clinical trials
work for its leading drug compounds. The contracts are terminable at any time, but obligate the Company to reimburse the providers for any time and costs incurred through the date of termination. The Company also has employment agreements with
certain of its current employees that provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting for share-based awards if their employment is terminated under specified circumstances.

  As of September 30, 2016, the Company leases approximately 8,800 square feet of office space
for the Company s executive and administrative offices. The monthly rental rate is approximately $29,000 during the remaining term of the lease, plus a pro-rata share of certain building expenses. The lease expires in June 2017. Total future
minimum payments under the lease are $257,000 through June 30, 2017.     Asset Purchase Agreement   
 In August 2012, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with S*Bio Pte Ltd ( S*Bio ), pursuant to which the
Company agreed to acquire certain assets comprised of intellectual property and technology including rights to Pracinostat, in exchange for $500,000 of common stock. In August 2012, the Company completed the asset purchase and issued 195,756 shares
of common stock to S*Bio. The Company has also agreed to make certain milestone payments to S*Bio based on the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and net sales-based milestones, as well as to make certain contingent earnout payments to
S*Bio. Milestone payments will be made to S*Bio up to an aggregate amount of $75.2 million if certain U.S., E.U. and Japanese regulatory approvals are obtained and if certain net sales thresholds are met in North America, the E.U. and Japan. The
first milestone payment of $200,000 payable in cash, plus $500,000 payable in cash or in shares of the Company s common stock, will be due upon the first dosing of a patient in a Phase III clinical trial or other pivotal trial, for any
indication. Subsequent milestone payments will be due upon certain regulatory approvals and sales-based events. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has accrued $700,000 for potential future payments.  
  CyDex License Agreement   
 In September 2012, the Company entered into a license agreement with CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( CyDex ). Under the license
agreement, CyDex granted to the Company an exclusive, nontransferable license to intellectual property rights relating to Captisol    for use with the Company s isoflavone-based drug
compounds. The Company agreed to pay to CyDex a non-refundable license issuance fee, future milestone payments, and royalties at a low, single-digit percentage on future sales of the Company s approved drugs utilizing Captisol.
Contemporaneously with the license agreement, the Company and CyDex entered into a commercial supply agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase 100% of its requirements for Captisol from CyDex. The Company may terminate both the
license agreement and the supply agreement for convenience at any time upon 90 days  prior written notice. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not accrued any amounts for potential future payments.  
  Note 5. Short-Term Investments     As of
September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company s short-term investments consisted of $45.1 million and $35.1 million, respectively, in U.S. government securities. The short-term investments held as of September 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2016 had maturity dates of less than one year, are considered to be  held to maturity  and are carried at amortized cost. Due to the short-term maturities of these instruments, the amortized cost approximates the related fair
values. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the gross holding gains and losses were immaterial.     Note 6. Stockholders  Equity
     Equity Transactions      Shelf
Registration Statement     In April 2014, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC ( shelf
registration statement ). The shelf registration statement was declared effective by the SEC in April 2014. The shelf registration statement permits the Company to sell, from time to time, up to $150.0 million of common stock, preferred stock
and warrants. As of September 30, 2016, there is $104.0 million aggregate value of securities available under the shelf registration statement. Pursuant to SEC regulations, if the market value of the Company s public float is below $75.0
million, the Company cannot sell securities from the shelf registration statement which represent more than one-third of the market value of the Company s non-affiliated public float during any 12-month period. The market value of the
Company s non-affiliated public float was less than $75.0 million as of September 30, 2016. Accordingly, until the Company s non-affiliated public float exceeds $75.0 million, the Company may not sell shares with a market value
greater than one-third of its non-affiliated public float during any 12-month period under the shelf registration statement.     Helsinn
Equity Investment     The Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Helsinn Equity Agreement ), dated as of
August 5, 2016, with Helsinn Investment Fund SA (the  Purchaser ). Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Agreement, the Purchaser agreed to purchase and the Company agreed to issue a number of shares of the Company s common stock
determined by dividing $5,000,000 by the volume weighted-average price for shares of the Company s common stock for the ten trading day period beginning on August 1, 2016 and ending on August 12, 2016 (the  VWAP ), rounded
to the nearest whole share. The VWAP was $1.911 per share. Accordingly, on August 16, 2016, the Company issued 2,616,431 shares of common stock. The transaction was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended.

   Warrants   
 As of September 30, 2016, there were outstanding warrants to purchase 315,484 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise
price of $7.14 per share, which expire in May 2017, issued in conjunction with the Company s May 2012 rights offering; outstanding Series A warrants and warrants issued to the Company s placement agent for its May 2011 private placement to
purchase up to 215,721 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.00 per share, which expire in November 2016; and warrants to purchase 3,230,202 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $3.12 per share, which expire
in December 2017, issued in conjunction with its December 2012 private placement.     Note 7. Share-based Compensation   
 The Company uses equity-based compensation programs to provide long-term performance incentives for its employees. These incentives consist
primarily of stock options and restricted stock units ( RSUs ).    MEI Pharma s 2008 Stock Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan
(the  2008 Equity Plan ) provides for the grant of options and/or other share-based or share-denominated awards to the Company s non-employee directors, officers, employees and advisors. The 2008 Equity Plan was initially adopted in
2008 and was amended and restated in 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Effective December 3, 2015, the Company s stockholders voted to further amend and restate the 2008 Equity Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for
issuance under the plan to 6,686,000 shares, among other changes. As of September 30, 2016, there were 1,566,845 shares available for future grant under the 2008 Equity Plan.  
 Total share-based compensation expense for all stock awards consists of the following, in thousands:  
   
    Stock Options   
 Stock option activity for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows:  
   
   The fair value of each stock option granted during the three months ended September 30, 2016 is estimated
on the grant date under the fair value method using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Stock options granted to employees during the three months ended September 30, 2016 vest 25% one year from the date of grant and ratably each month thereafter
for a period of 36 months and expire ten years from the date of grant. Stock options granted to directors during the three months ended September 30, 2016 vest ratably each month for a period of 12 months from the date of grant and expire ten
years from the date of grant. The RSU equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of the Company s common stock. The estimated fair values of the stock options and RSUs, including the effect of estimated forfeitures, are expensed
over the service period.    The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the fair value of options granted during the
period:

  As of September 30, 2016, there was $2.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense
related to the unvested portion of stock options. Such compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.  
  Restricted Stock Units   
 In March 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted 400,000 RSUs to the Company s Chief Executive Officer,
Dr. Daniel P. Gold. Each RSU represents the contingent right to receive one share of the Company s common stock. One-third of the RSUs vested on August 30, 2014, one-third vested on August 30, 2015, and the remaining
one-third vested on August 30, 2016. The shares underlying the RSUs will be delivered to Dr. Gold on the earliest to occur of (i) March 29, 2018, (ii) Dr. Gold s death, disability or separation from service from
the Company for any reason, or (iii) a change in control involving the Company. The fair value of the RSUs on the date of grant was $3.5 million. The grant date fair value per unit was $8.63.  
 In June 2016, the Company granted 364,726 RSUs to employees. Each RSU represents the contingent right to receive one share of the
Company s common stock. The RSUs were subject to performance criteria that were met in August 2016. The RSUs will vest in August 2018. The fair value of the RSUs was measured at $1.61 per unit on the date the performance criteria were met.
Under the terms of the 2008 Plan, each of these RSUs is calculated as 1.25 shares of common stock for purposes of determining the number of shares available for future grant. There were 363,014 unvested RSUs outstanding as of September 30,
2016.    As of September 30, 2016, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Company s RSUs was
approximately $0.5 million and is expected to be recognized over approximately 1.8 years.

Results of Operations     This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in
this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding the future financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words  believe,   may, 
 will,   estimate,   continue,   anticipate,   intend,   should,   plan,   expect,  and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business
strategy and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, without limitation, those described in  Risk Factors  in our 2016 Annual Report, and elsewhere in
this report, including, among other things:      

our inability to obtain required additional financing or financing available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, which may cause us to delay, scale-back or eliminate plans related to development of our drug
candidates;        

Helsinn or other parties with which we have entered into collaboration, license, development and/or commercialization agreements may not satisfy their obligations under the agreements which could impact future revenues;

we are in early stage clinical studies for our product candidates on which our development plans are based; clinical studies by their nature typically have a high level of risk and may not produce successful results;

the results of pre-clinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our current drug candidates may not have favorable results in later studies or trials;

our inability to maintain or enter into, and the risks resulting from our dependence upon, contractual arrangements necessary for the clinical development, manufacture, commercialization, marketing, sales and
distribution of our product candidates;        

costs and delays in our clinical development programs and/or receipt of U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) or other required governmental or regulatory approvals, or the failure to obtain such
approvals, for our product candidates;        

the FDA s interpretation and our interpretation of data from preclinical and clinical studies may differ significantly;        

our failure to successfully commercialize our product candidates;        

the failure of any products to gain market acceptance;        

our inability to control the costs of manufacturing our products;        

our reliance on acquisitions or licenses from third parties to expand our pipeline of drug candidates;        

competition and competitive factors;        

our inability to protect our patents or proprietary rights and obtain necessary rights to third party patents and intellectual property to operate our business;    

our inability to operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of others;        

costs stemming from our defense against third party intellectual property infringement claims;        

general economic conditions;        

technological changes;        

government regulation generally;        

changes in industry practice; and        

one-time events.      These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report and our other
filings with the SEC include additional factors which could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not
possible for us to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements.    You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you
that the events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels
of activity, performance or achievements. The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information set forth in the financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2016 Annual Report, as filed with the SEC. Operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods.
    Overview and Recent Developments     We
are an oncology company focused on the clinical development of novel therapies for cancer. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol  MEIP .  
      12  

Table of Contents  

  Our business purpose is the development of drugs for the treatment of cancer. Our portfolio of
clinical drug candidates includes Pracinostat, an oral HDAC inhibitor that is being developed in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AML who are    75 years of
age or unfit for intensive chemotherapy, and high-risk MDS. In August 2016, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license, development and commercialization agreement with Helsinn for Pracinostat in AML, MDS and other potential indications. Our
clinical development portfolio also includes ME-401, an oral inhibitor of PI3K delta being developed for B-cell malignancies, and ME-344, a mitochondrial inhibitor that has shown evidence of clinical activity in refractory solid tumors. We own
exclusive worldwide rights to ME-401 and ME-344.     Clinical Development Programs   
  HDAC Inhibitor Drug Candidate: Pracinostat   
 In August 2016, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the
treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AML who are    75 years of age or unfit for intensive chemotherapy. In addition, agreement has been reached with the FDA on the proposed Phase III study design.
According to the FDA, Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for Breakthrough Therapy Designation require preliminary clinical evidence
that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy.    The
Breakthrough Therapy Designation is supported by data from a Phase II study of Pracinostat plus azacitidine in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML who are not candidates for induction chemotherapy. The study showed a median overall survival of
19.1 months and a complete response (CR) rate of 42% (21 of 50 patients). These data compare favorably to a recent international Phase III study of azacitidine (AZA-001; Dombret et al.  Blood . 2015 May 18), which showed a median
overall survival of 10.4 months with azacitidine alone and a CR rate of 19.5% in a similar patient population. The combination of Pracinostat and azacitidine was generally well tolerated, with no unexpected toxicities. The most common grade 3/4
treatment-emergent adverse events included febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and fatigue.    In August 2016, we entered into an
exclusive license, development and commercialization agreement with Helsinn, a Swiss pharmaceutical corporation, for Pracinostat in AML, MDS and other potential indications ( Helsinn License Agreement ). Under the terms of the agreement,
Helsinn is granted a worldwide exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pracinostat, and is primarily responsible for funding its global development and commercialization. As compensation for such grant of rights, we will receive
near-term payments of $20.0 million, including a $15.0 million upfront payment which was received in August 2016, and a $5.0 million payment upon the earlier to occur of (i) dosing of the first patient in the upcoming Phase III study of
Pracinostat in newly diagnosed AML patients unfit to receive induction therapy, or (ii) March 1, 2017. In addition, we will be eligible to receive up to $444 million in potential regulatory and sales-based milestones, along with royalty
payments on the net sales of Pracinostat.    As part of the Helsinn License Agreement, we will work with Helsinn to determine an optimal
dosing regimen of Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of high and very high risk MDS. The cost of this study would be shared by Helsinn and us and enrollment is anticipated to commence in the first half of calendar year
2017.     PI3-Kinase Delta Drug Candidate: ME-401   
 In September 2013, we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to ME-401 from Pathway Therapeutics, Inc. for an undisclosed upfront cash payment
with no future milestone or royalty obligations. Data from pre-clinical studies show ME-401 to be a potent and selective oral inhibitor of PI3K delta, a molecular target that plays a critical role in the proliferation and survival of certain
hematologic cancer cells. PI3K delta is a class of drugs that has shown promise in the treatment of B-cell malignancies, but with particular toxicities. We believe this provides an opportunity for a next-generation oral drug that can produce
therapeutic responses at a safe, effective dose. ME-401 has a distinct chemical structure from certain other PI3K delta inhibitors, including idelalisib (marketed as Zydelig   ). Data presented
at the ASH Annual Meeting in December 2012 demonstrated that ME-401 has superior pre-clinical activity compared to idelalisib.    Results
from a first-in-human, single ascending dose clinical study of ME-401 in healthy volunteers were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting in April 2016. The data demonstrated on-target activity at very low plasma
concentrations. In addition, the results from the study suggest that ME-401 has the potential for a superior pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and an improved therapeutic window compared to idelalisib, with a half-life that supports
once-daily dosing. In March 2016, the FDA approved our Investigational New Drug application for ME-401 in B-cell malignancies. A Phase Ib dose-escalation study of ME-401 in patients with recurrent CLL or fNHL opened for enrollment in September 2016.
The goal of the study is to demonstrate an improved therapeutic window with repeated dosing in cancer patients. Interim data is expected in the second quarter of calendar year 2017.

   Mitochondrial Inhibitor Drug Candidate: ME-344   
 ME-344 is our isoflavone-derived mitochondrial inhibitor drug candidate. In preclinical studies, ME-344 has been shown to cause cell death in
multiple human tumor cell lines, including ovarian cancer stem cells, by interfering with mitochondrial energy generation.    Results from
our first-in-human, single-agent Phase I clinical trial of ME-344 in patients with refractory solid tumors were published in the April 1, 2015 issue of  Cancer . The results indicated that eight of 21 evaluable patients (38%) treated
with ME-344 achieved stable disease or better, including five who experienced progression-free survival that was at least twice the duration of their last prior treatment before entry into the study. In addition, one of these patients, a heavily
pre-treated patient with small cell lung cancer, achieved a confirmed partial response and remained on study for two years. ME-344 was generally well tolerated at doses equal to or less than 10 mg/kg delivered on a weekly schedule for extended
durations. Treatment-related adverse events included nausea, dizziness and fatigue. Dose limiting toxicities were observed at both the 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose levels, consisting primarily of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy.  
 In May 2015, we announced new pre-clinical data from a collaboration with the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre in Madrid showing
mitochondria-specific effects of ME-344 in cancer cells, including substantially enhanced anti-tumor activity when combined with agents that inhibit the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ). These new data demonstrate
that the anti-cancer effects when combining ME-344 with a VEGF inhibitor are due to an inhibition of both mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism. An investigator-sponsored study of ME-344 in combination with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab (marketed
as Avastin   ) in HER2-negative breast cancer opened for enrollment in August 2016.     Results of
Operations      Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
 We incurred losses of $4.3 million and $4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
   Revenues:   We recognized research and development revenue of $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to no
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The research and development revenue resulted from the recognition of fees allocated to research and development activities in accordance with the Helsinn License Agreement which was signed
in August 2016.      Cost of Research and Development Revenue:   We recognized cost of research and development revenue of $1.1 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to no cost of research and development revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The cost of research and development revenue includes internal compensation and related personnel
expenses to support our research and development revenue and external costs paid to third-party contractors to perform research, conduct clinical trials and develop and manufacture drug materials.  
   Research and Development   :  Research and development expenses consist primarily of clinical trial costs (including payments to contract
research organizations), pre-clinical study costs, costs to manufacture our drug candidates for non-clinical and clinical studies and salaries and other personnel costs. Research and development expenses decreased by $1.2 million to $1.6 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in clinical trial costs associated with Pracinostat and with ME-344, including a
reduction of clinical trial costs of $1.0 million due to revisions in estimates of amounts that are owed to contract research organizations for clinical trials for Pracinostat and ME-344 that are at or near completion. Expenses related to
Pracinostat decreased pursuant to our license agreement with Helsinn, under which Helsinn will be primarily responsible for funding the development and commercialization of Pracinostat and, subject to certain exceptions, will be solely responsible
for all costs related thereto.      General and Administrative   :  General and administrative expenses increased by $0.9 million to $2.7
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is due to higher levels of professional services expenses associated with the Helsinn License
Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.      Other income or
expense:   We received interest and dividend income of $55,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $27,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due to higher yields during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.     Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 We have accumulated losses of $181.3 million since inception and expect to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from
operations for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2016, we had $58.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which we believe will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months. Our
current business operations are focused on continuing the clinical development of our drug candidates. Changes to our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future use of existing cash
resources. To date, we have obtained cash and funded our operations primarily through equity financings. In order to continue the development of our drug candidates, at some point in the future we expect to pursue one or more capital transactions,
whether through the sale of equity securities, license agreements or entry into strategic partnerships.

   Sources and Uses of Our Cash   
 Net cash provided by operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $8.8 million compared to $5.8 million used in
operations for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the $15.0 upfront payment received as part of the Helsinn License Agreement.  
 Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $10.0 million compared to net cash provided by
investing activities of $4.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used in investing activities represents purchases of investments in short-term U.S. government securities in excess of maturities.  
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.2 million, representing the equity
investment by Helsinn in a transaction related to the Helsinn License Agreement. There was no cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
  Contractual Obligations     We have
contracted with various consultants and third parties to assist us in pre-clinical research and development and clinical trials work for our leading drug compounds. The contracts are terminable at any time, but obligate us to reimburse the providers
for any time or costs incurred through the date of termination. Additionally, we have employment agreements with certain of our current employees that provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting for share-based awards if their employment
is terminated under specified circumstances.    As of September 30, 2016, we lease approximately 8,800 square feet of office space at a
monthly rental rate of approximately $29,000 per month during the term of the lease, through June 2017.     CyDex License Agreement
    In September 2012, the Company entered into a license agreement with CyDex. Under the license agreement, CyDex granted to the Company
an exclusive, nontransferable license to intellectual property rights relating to Captisol    for use with the Company s isoflavone-based drug compounds. The Company agreed to pay to CyDex
a non-refundable license issuance fee, future milestone payments, and royalties at a low, single-digit percentage rate on future sales of the Company s approved drugs utilizing Captisol. Contemporaneously with the license agreement, the Company
and CyDex entered into a commercial supply agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase 100% of its requirements for Captisol from CyDex. The Company may terminate both the license agreement and the supply agreement for convenience at
any time upon 90 days  prior written notice.     S*Bio Asset Purchase   
 In August 2012, we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with S*Bio, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire certain assets
comprised of intellectual property and technology including rights to Pracinostat, in exchange for $500,000 of common stock. On August 22, 2012, we completed the asset purchase and issued 195,756 shares of common stock to S*Bio. We also agreed
to make certain milestone payments to S*Bio based on the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and net sales-based milestones, as well as to make certain contingent earnout payments to S*Bio. Milestone payments will be made to S*Bio up to an
aggregate amount of $75.2 million if certain U.S., E.U. and Japanese regulatory approvals are obtained and if certain net sales thresholds are met in North America, the E.U. and Japan. The first milestone payment of $200,000 payable in cash, plus
$500,000 payable in cash or in shares of the Company s common stock, will be due upon the first dosing of a patient in a Phase III clinical trial or other pivotal trial, for any indication. Subsequent milestone payments will be due upon certain
regulatory approvals and sales-based events. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has accrued $700,000 for potential future payments.     Critical
Accounting Policies and Management Estimates     We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1, The Company and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to financial statements included in our 2016 Annual Report. We discuss our critical accounting estimates in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, in our 2016 Annual Report. There have been no changes in our significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates since June 30, 2016, other than the adoption of revenue recognition policies as a result of the Helsinn
License Agreement.            In August 2016, we entered into the Helsinn License Agreement. Under the terms of the
agreement, Helsinn is granted a worldwide exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pracinostat, and is primarily responsible for funding its global development and commercialization. As compensation for such grant of rights,
we received a $15.0 million upfront payment in August 2016, and will receive a $5.0 million payment upon the earlier of (i) dosing of the first patient in the upcoming Phase III study of Pracinostat in newly diagnosed AML patients who are
    75 years of age or unfit to receive induction therapy or (ii) March 1, 2017. We will also receive reimbursement related to agreements entered into by MEI in anticipation of the upcoming Phase III study of Pracinostat by Helsinn
as well as a Phase II study for Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of high and very high risk MDS, which will be conducted by MEI. The current expected external cost of the Phase II study will be shared equally by Helsinn
and us. Enrollment in the Phase II study is anticipated to commence in the first half of calendar year 2017. We will be eligible to receive up to $444 million in potential regulatory and sales-based milestones, along with royalty payments on the net
sales of Pracinostat.

  We have determined that the exclusive license, development and commercialization agreement
represents a multiple-element arrangement for purposes of revenue recognition. Revenue related to the license will be recognized upon completion of the technology and data transfer, which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of
fiscal year 2017. Revenue related to research and development elements of the arrangement will be recognized over the period of each research and development activity. Revenue associated with third-party costs will be recognized on a gross basis as
such costs are incurred.    Contemporaneously with the Helsinn License Agreement, we entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the
 Helsinn Equity Agreement ), dated as of August 5, 2016, with Helsinn Investment Fund SA (the  Purchaser ). Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Agreement, the Purchaser agreed to purchase and we agreed to issue a number of
shares of our common stock determined by dividing $5,000,000 by the volume weighted-average price for shares of our common stock for the ten trading day period beginning on August 1, 2016 and ending on August 12, 2016 (the
 VWAP ), rounded to the nearest whole share. The VWAP was $1.911 per share. Accordingly, on August 16, 2016, we issued 2,616,431 shares of common stock. The difference between the VWAP price of $1.911 per share and the closing price
of our common stock on August 5, 2016 of $1.61 of $788,000 has been allocated to the revenue elements.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The standard provides companies with a single model for accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including
industry-specific revenue guidance. The core principle of the model is to recognize revenue when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer, as opposed to recognizing revenue when the risks and rewards transfer to the customer under
the existing revenue guidance. The guidance permits companies to either apply the requirements retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment. In August 2015, the
FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Deferral of the Effective Date , which defers the required adoption date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result of the deferred effective date, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company in its first quarter of
fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date of the new standard of the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The following ASUs were subsequently issued by the FASB to clarify the implementation guidance in some areas
and add practical expedients: In March 2016, ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Principal versus Agent Considerations ; in April 2016, ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing ; in May 2016, ASU 2016-11,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers and Derivatives and Hedging Rescission of SEC Guidance ; and ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers Narrow Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients . We are in the process of evaluating the transition method that will be elected and the impact of adoption on our financial statements.  
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern . The standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining
when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 applies to
all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Subsequent to adoption, we will apply the guidance in ASU 2014-15 to assess its ability to continue as a going
concern.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02  Leases , which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease
liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance
sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact
that the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09  Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on
the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this
standard will have on our financial statements.

  In June 2016, the FASB issued No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments  Credit Losses
(Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . Topic 326 amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost
basis, Topic 326 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current U.S. GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that
is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current U.S. GAAP, however Topic
326 will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. ASU 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The
amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to
receive cash. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its financial
statements.       Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   
 Our exposure to market interest rates relates primarily to the investment of cash balances and short-term investments. We have cash reserves
held in U.S. dollars and we place funds on deposit with financial institutions, which are readily available. Our short-term investments consist solely of U.S. government securities with a maturity of three to twelve months.  
 We place our cash deposits with high credit quality financial institutions and by policy limit the amount of credit exposure to any one
corporation or bank. These deposits are in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. We are adverse to principal loss and we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We seek to
mitigate default risk by depositing funds with high credit quality financial institutions, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one corporation or bank, by purchasing short-term investments consisting of U.S. government securities, and
by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any such financial institution.    We
do not consider the effects of interest rate movements to be a material risk to our financial condition.       Item 4:
Controls and Procedures     At the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms.    There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     PART II OTHER INFORMATION

    Item 1A: Risk Factors

which Net Sales exceed both  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  and  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] ).       8.3 Royalty Payments.   
  8.3.1   Product.  On a country-by-country basis during the Royalty Term applicable to such country, Licensee shall pay to
Licensor in accordance with Section 8.5 the following royalties on Net Sales of the Product, subject to Sections 8.3.3 and 8.3.4:    (a)
Royalties for Net Sales of Product (i)  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  or (ii) directly Commercialized by Licensee or its Affiliates shall be payable at the following rates:      

Aggregate Annual Global Net  
  Sales of Product  
  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] and/or  
  directly Commercialized by  
  Licensee or its Affiliates   
   
    Royalty Rate on Net Sales of  
  Product [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  
  and/or directly Commercialized  
  by Licensee or its Affiliates in  
  Tier 1 Countries   
   
    Royalty Rate on Net Sales of  
  Product directly  
  Commercialized by Licensee  
  or its Affiliates in Tier 2  
  Countries    

[*CONFIDENTIAL*]  
   
  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  
   
  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]   
 
  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  
   
  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  
   
  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]   
 
  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  
   
  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  
   
  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]   
   (b) For Net Sales of Product  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  and not directly Commercialized by Licensee or its
Affiliates in Tier 1 Countries:  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  of Net Sales of Product in each such country.    (c) For Net Sales of Product
 [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  and not directly Commercialized by Licensee or its Affiliates in Tier 2 Countries:  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  of Net Sales of Product in each such country.  
 For example purposes only, if aggregate annual global Net Sales equal  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , with  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  of such sales
 [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  and Tier 1 Countries where Licensee or its Affiliates are directly Commercializing the Product, then Licensor would receive total royalties for that year equal to  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , calculated as follows:

A request for confidential treatment has been made with respect to portions of the following document
that are marked with [*CONFIDENTIAL*]. The redacted portions have been filed separately with the SEC.       
  (1) Sales  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  and Tier 1 Countries where Licensee or its Affiliates are
directly Commercializing the Product:  [*CONFIDENTIAL*];  PLUS    (2) sales in Tier 1 Countries ( [*CONFIDENTIAL*] ) where
Licensee and its Affiliates are not directly Commercializing:  [*CONFIDENTIAL*].      8.3.2 Royalties in connection with
[*CONFIDENTIAL*].     (a) On such timing as the Parties may agree in good faith, Licensee shall engage a Third Party expert selected by
Licensee, and reasonably acceptable to Licensor, to evaluate, at Licensee s sole expense, the  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  by Licensee (or its Sublicensees) of  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] . Licensee shall share such expert s determination with
Licensor.    (b) Regardless of such expert s determination, Licensee shall have the right to decide at its discretion whether or not to
 [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  (including direct Commercialization or through its Affiliates, Sublicensees or other nominees). If Licensee s decision is positive, then (i) the licenses granted to Licensee in Sections 2.1.1 and 2.2.2 under the
Licensor Technology shall, to the extent applicable, automatically be expanded from just the Product to also include  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , and (ii) Licensee shall pay to Licensor during the Royalty Term a royalty on Net Sales
 [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  at a rate of  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  where such sales are  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that for purposes of calculating the royalties
due under this Section 8.3.2(b), in each country in which Licensee or its Affiliate or Sublicensee is  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  royalties will be payable  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] . For example, if Licensee or its Sublicensee is
 [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  in a given country, and such Person(s) sells  [*CONFIDENTIAL*],  then there will be deemed to be  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  that are subject to royalty payments under this Section 8.3.2(b).  
  8.3.3   Royalty Reductions in the United States and Countries Where Licensee or its Affiliates are Directly Commercializing the
Product.    On a country-by-country basis, if at any time during the Royalty Term in the United States or any country where Licensee and its Affiliates are directly Commercializing the Product a Generic Product is commercially sold and
remains on the market in such country for a period of  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , then the royalty rate applicable for such country shall be reduced, starting  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  from the day when the Generic Product is commercially sold, by
 [*CONFIDENTIAL*] . Such  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  application shall be accomplished by way of the Parties calculating the overall amount of overpaid royalties based on such  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  reduction, and Licensee shall have the
right to offset any such amount against further payments to be paid to Licensor under this Agreement; provided, that when applying any such offset Licensee shall advise Licensor thereof in writing, including the amount of such offset remaining.
Thereafter,    (a) for so long as such Generic Product remains on the market in such country, if the cumulative Net Sales in such country
during a Calendar Quarter are equal to or exceed  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , but are less than  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , of the Baseline Quarter  
      29  

A request for confidential treatment has been made with respect to portions of the following document
that are marked with [*CONFIDENTIAL*]. The redacted portions have been filed separately with the SEC.       
  
Net Sales, then the royalty rate will be further reduced by  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  in addition to the  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  reduction mentioned at Section 8.3.3 above; or  
 (b) for so long as such Generic Product remains on the market in such country, if the cumulative Net Sales in such country during a Calendar
Quarter are less than  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , of the Baseline Quarter Net Sales, then the royalty rate will be further reduced by  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  in addition to the  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  reduction mentioned at Section 8.3.3.  
  8.3.4   Royalty Reductions in Countries Where Licensee or its Affiliates are not Directly Commercializing the Product (other than the
United States).    On a country-by-country basis, if at any time during the Royalty Term with respect to any country where Licensee or its Affiliates are not directly Commercializing the Product (other than the United States), a Generic
Product is commercially sold and remains on the market in such country for a period of  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , then the royalty rate applicable for such country shall be reduced, starting  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  from the day when the Generic
Product is commercially sold, by  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] . Such  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  application shall be accomplished by way of the Parties calculating the overall amount of overpaid royalties based on the such  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  reduction,
and Licensee shall have the right to offset any such amount against further payments to be paid to Licensor under this Agreement; provided, that when applying any such offset Licensee shall advise Licensor thereof in writing, including the amount of
such offset remaining. Thereafter, and for so long as such Generic Products remain on the market, if cumulative Net Sales in such country during a Calendar Quarter are less than  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  of the Baseline Quarter Net Sales, then
the royalty rate will be reduced to  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] .     8.3.5   Royalty Minimum.    Notwithstanding the
foregoing Sections 8.3.3 and 8.3.4, or Sections 9.2(c), 9.2(d) and 9.3(c)(iii), on a country-by-country basis and for the shorter of (i) the Royalty Term in each such country or (ii)  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , in no event shall the royalties payable
by Licensee to Licensor be reduced to less than  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  of Net Sales in such country.     8.4   Royalties due under
the S*BIO Agreement.     [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  shall be responsible for any payments due to S*BIO in connection with Development, Manufacture, and Commercialization of the Product, including payments associated with Net Sales of any
given Product in any country. Throughout the Term, Licensor agrees to comply with its obligations under the S*BIO Agreement to the extent necessary to preserve Licensee s rights with respect to the Compound and the Product in the Territory
under this Agreement, and not take any action that would result in the loss of  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  rights held by Licensor thereunder.  
  8.5   Royalty Payments and Reports.    Licensee shall calculate all Royalty Payments payable to Licensor pursuant to
Section 8.3 with respect to Net Sales at the end of each Calendar Quarter, which amounts shall be converted to Dollars at such time in accordance with Section 8.7. Licensee shall pay to Licensor the royalty payment due for Net Sales during a
given Calendar Quarter within  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  after the end of such Calendar Quarter;  
      30  

A request for confidential treatment has been made with respect to portions of the following document
that are marked with [*CONFIDENTIAL*]. The redacted portions have been filed separately with the SEC.       
  
provided, that, Licensee may make such payments through any of its Affiliates; provided, further, that, and notwithstanding Section 8.6, in the event that payment through any such Affiliate
results in any given tax (or incremental tax increase) that would not have been payable had Licensee not made such payment through such Affiliate, then Licensee shall be solely responsible for such tax (or incremental tax increase). Licensee
shall also provide Licensor with a good faith estimate of all Net Sales and the Royalty Payments due in connection therewith within  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  following the end of each Calendar Quarter, provided however that this will not create any
liability on Licensee in connection with any inaccuracy which may be included in such estimate. Each royalty payment due shall be accompanied by (i) a statement of the amount of gross sales of each Royalty Product, (a) as a whole and (b) on a
country-by-country basis during the applicable Calendar Quarter (including such amounts expressed in local currency and as converted to Dollars), (ii) an itemized calculation of Net Sales (a) as a whole and (b) on a country-by-country basis, showing
for both (a) and (b) deductions provided for in the definition of  Net Sales  during such Calendar Quarter, and (iii) a statement of the prices and the number of units of Royalty Products sold. Licensee shall be responsible for the
proper accounting of Net Sales by or on behalf of its Sublicensees.     8.6 Taxes and Withholding.   
  8.6.1   VAT.  The Parties agree to cooperate with one another and use reasonable efforts to ensure that any value added tax or
similar payment (    VAT    ) in respect of any payments made by Licensee to Licensor under this Agreement does not represent an unnecessary cost in respect of payments made under this Agreement; provided, that the Parties
further agree that as of the Effective Date it is not anticipated that VAT will apply in connection with payments under this Agreement. For purposes of clarity, all sums payable under this Agreement shall be exclusive of VAT. In the event
that any VAT is owing in any jurisdiction in respect of any such payment, Licensee shall pay such VAT, and (i) if such VAT is owing as a result of any action by Licensee, including any assignment or sublicense (including assignment to, or payment
hereunder by, a Licensee-related entity or Affiliate), or any failure on the part of Licensee or its Affiliates to comply with applicable tax laws or filing or record retention requirements, that has the effect of modifying the tax treatment of the
Parties hereto, then the payment in respect of which such VAT is owing shall be made without deduction for or on account of such VAT to ensure that Licensor receives a sum equal to the sum which it would have received had such VAT not been due or
(ii) otherwise, such payment shall be made after deduction of such VAT. In the event that any deducted VAT is later recovered by Licensee, Licensee shall promptly reimburse Licensor for the deducted amount. For the sake of clarity, any
increase in payments to Licensor under this Section 8.6.1 shall reflect only the incremental increase in VAT directly resulting from clause (i) above. In the event that any VAT is owing in any jurisdiction in respect of any such payment,
Licensor will provide to Licensee tax invoices showing the correct amount of VAT in respect of such payments hereunder.     8.6.2 
 Withholding Tax Matters.  If Licensee is required to make a payment to Licensor subject to a deduction of tax or withholding tax, the sum payable by Licensee (in respect of which such deduction or withholding is required to be made) shall be
made to Licensor after deduction of the amount required to be so deducted or withheld, which  
      31  

A request for confidential treatment has been made with respect to portions of the following document
that are marked with [*CONFIDENTIAL*]. The redacted portions have been filed separately with the SEC.       
  
deducted or withheld amount shall be remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Laws. Any such withholding taxes required under Applicable Laws to be
paid or withheld shall be an expense of, and borne solely by Licensor, subject to Section 8.6.1, and the obligation of Licensee to assume the responsibility of such expense in the event that such expense arises as a result of any action by Licensee.
    8.6.3   Tax Cooperation.  To the extent Licensee is required to deduct and withhold taxes on any payments to Licensor,
Licensee shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper Governmental Authority in a timely manner and promptly transmit to Licensor an official tax certificate or other evidence of such withholding reasonably sufficient to enable Licensor to
claim such payments of taxes. Licensor shall provide to Licensee any tax forms that may be reasonably necessary in order for Licensee not to withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable bilateral income tax
treaty. Licensor shall use reasonable efforts to provide any such tax forms to Licensee at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for any payments for which the Licensor desires that Licensee apply a reduced withholding rate. Each
Party shall provide the other with reasonable assistance to enable the recovery or reduction, as permitted by Applicable Laws, of withholding taxes, VAT, or similar obligations resulting from payments made under this Agreement, such recovery to be
for the benefit of the Party bearing such withholding tax or VAT.     8.7   Currency Conversion.    All payments
hereunder shall be made in United States Dollars. For the purpose of calculating any sums due under, or otherwise reimbursable pursuant to, this Agreement (including the calculation of Net Sales expressed in currencies other than Dollars), any
amount expressed in a foreign currency shall be converted into Dollars in a manner consistent with Licensee s normal practices used to prepare its audited financial statements for external reporting purposes, in accordance with GAAP,
consistently applied, or by using the Wall Street Journal or Reuters, at Licensee s discretion.     8.8   Late
Payments.    Any amount required to be paid by Licensee hereunder which is not paid on the date due shall accrue interest from the date due at the rate of the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate
(    LIBOR    ) as quoted in the Wall Street Journal (or if it no longer exists, similarly authoritative source) plus four hundred (400) basis points; provided, however, that in no event shall such rate exceed the maximum
legal annual interest rate. The payment of such interest shall not limit Licensor from exercising any other rights it may have as a consequence of the lateness of any payment. Such interest shall be computed on the basis of a year of three
hundred sixty (360) days for the actual number of days payment is delinquent.     8.9   Records; Audits.  Licensee shall keep
full, true and accurate records and books of account containing all particulars that may be necessary for the purpose of confirming the accuracy of, and calculating, as applicable, all royalty payments and other amounts due to Licensor hereunder
(including records of Net Sales), during the Term and for two (2) years thereafter or such longer period as required by Applicable Laws. Licensor shall have a right to request one audit of Licensee in each Calendar Year throughout the Term in
order to confirm the accuracy of the foregoing (an     Audit    ); provided, that, such one audit per Calendar Year limitation shall not apply in the event of any subsequent  for cause  audit. Upon the written

A request for confidential treatment has been made with respect to portions of the following document
that are marked with [*CONFIDENTIAL*]. The redacted portions have been filed separately with the SEC.       
  
request by Licensor to Audit Licensee, Licensor shall have the right to engage an independent, internationally recognized accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Licensee and which will be
subject to appropriate written obligations of confidentiality, to perform a review as is reasonably necessary to enable such accounting firm to calculate or otherwise confirm the accuracy of any of the foregoing for the Calendar Year(s) requested by
Licensor. Licensee, shall make personnel reasonably available during regular business hours to answer queries on all such books and records required for the purpose of the Audit. The accountants shall deliver a copy of their findings to
each of the Parties within ten (10) Business Days of the completion of the review, and, in the absence of fraud or manifest error, the findings of such accountant shall be final and binding on each of the Parties. Any underpayments by Licensee
shall be paid to Licensor within five (5) Business Days of notification of the results of such Audit. Any overpayments made by Licensee shall be refunded by Licensor within five (5) Business Days of notification of the results of such
Audit. The cost of the accountants shall be the responsibility of Licensor unless the accountants  calculation shows that the actual royalties payable, Net Sales and/or any other applicable amount Audited hereunder (in the aggregate with
respect to the entire period audited) to be different, by more than  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , than the amounts as paid and reported by Licensee for the period subject to the Audit, in which case Licensee shall bear the costs of the
accountants. Any information obtained during such audit shall be treated as Confidential Information. In the event that Licensor has a good faith basis, which shall be shared with Licensee, for believing that a Sublicensee of Licensee is
not accurately reporting Net Sales (and thus that Licensee is not making appropriate royalty payments hereunder), then at Licensor s request, Licensee shall enforce its audit rights with respect to any such Sublicensee and Licensee shall report
back to Licensor regarding the outcome of any such audit.     ARTICLE 9   
  PROSECUTION, MAINTENANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF LICENSOR PATENTS   
  9.1 Licensor Patents.   
  9.1.1   Licensor Responsibility and Ownership of Intellectual Property.    Licensor shall prosecute, maintain and,
subject to Section 9.4, extend the Licensor Patents, including conducting any interferences, reexaminations, reissues, opposition proceedings, or request for patent term extension relating thereto, at its sole cost and expense. Licensor shall
provide Licensee with an updated  Schedule   1.41  on an annual basis or more frequently upon Licensee s reasonable request.  
  9.1.2   Licensee s Cooperation.    At Licensor s request, Licensee shall reasonably cooperate with the
prosecution of the Licensor Patents. Licensor shall give Licensee the opportunity to discuss and comment on the matter, it being understood that Licensor shall have the right to ultimately decide on all steps to be taken, and shall be solely
responsible, for the maintenance, prosecution or extension of the Licensor Patents.

A request for confidential treatment has been made with respect to portions of the following document
that are marked with [*CONFIDENTIAL*]. The redacted portions have been filed separately with the SEC.       
   9.1.3   Discontinuation of Prosecution or Maintenance of the Licensor Patents.  
 If, during the Term, Licensor decides to no longer prosecute or maintain any Licensor Patent, Licensor shall notify Licensee in writing of such decision as soon as possible (but in no event less than  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] ) prior to any filing
or payment due date, or any other date that requires action, in connection with such Licensor Patent and Licensee shall thereupon have the right, but not the obligation, to assume responsibility for the filing, prosecution or maintenance thereof in
the name of Licensor and at Licensee s cost and expense. If Licensee elects to exercise such right, Licensor shall execute such assignments and other documents and perform such acts at Licensee s reasonable expense as may be reasonably
necessary to allow Licensee to file, maintain and prosecute such Patents in Licensee s name, and such Patents shall cease to be Licensor Patents and thereafter shall be deemed Licensee Patents for all purposes of this Agreement (including, for
clarity, for the purpose of Section 1.63.1 above). Licensor will use good faith efforts to make available to Licensee its authorized attorneys, agents or representatives, or such of its employees as are reasonably necessary to assist Licensee in
exercising its rights described under this Section 9.1.3. Licensor will sign, or will have signed, all legal documents as are reasonably necessary to enable Licensee to prosecute and maintain such Patents.  
  9.1.4   Patents listed in    Schedule 1.14  . Licensor hereby assigns and transfers to Licensee the Patents listed in
 Schedule 1.14 . Promptly following the Effective Date, the Parties shall execute and file as appropriate such assignment and other documents as may be required to fully and effectively vest all rights, title, and interests in and to such
Patents in Licensee.     9.2 Infringement by Compound or Product.   
 (a) Each of the Parties shall promptly, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of notice thereof, notify the
other Party in writing in the event of any notice or claim by a Third Party of alleged patent or other intellectual property infringement by Licensee or its Affiliates or Sublicensees with respect to the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or
importation of the Compound or Product (each, an     Infringement Claim    ). With respect to any Infringement Claim, the Parties shall attempt to negotiate in good faith an amicable resolution with respect thereto with the
appropriate Third Party. If the Parties cannot settle such Infringement Claim with the appropriate Third Parties within fifteen (15) Business Days after the receipt of the notice pursuant to this Section, then, (i) Section 9.2(c) shall first apply,
and (ii) if no agreement is entered pursuant to Section 9.2(c), then Licensee shall have the right and obligation to defend any such suit or action and, and the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of such suit or action, each bearing
its own expenses, subject to Section 9.2(d).    (b) Neither Licensor nor Licensee shall take a position in connection with an Infringement
Claim, including defense, settlement or compromise of any such suit or action without the consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if the position, including defenses or settlement or compromise, would have a
material adverse impact on the other Party (in which case the consent of such other Party shall be required). For

A request for confidential treatment has been made with respect to portions of the following document
that are marked with [*CONFIDENTIAL*]. The redacted portions have been filed separately with the SEC.       
  
purposes of this Section 9.2(b), any settlement in connection with an Infringement Claim that would involve the waiver of rights (including the rights to receive payments) of such other Party
shall be deemed a material adverse impact and shall require the consent of such other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.  
 (c) If necessary to avoid infringement of intellectual property owned or controlled by a Third Party through the Manufacture, use or
Commercialization of the Compound or the Product (as the Product and/or Compound (i) are described and/or claimed in the Licensor Patents and (ii) are being Developed and Manufactured by or on behalf of Licensor as of the Effective Date) for the
Target Indication or Second Indication in the Territory, Licensee and Licensor shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain a license for Licensee under the Third Party s intellectual property right. In particular, Licensor shall have
the first right to negotiate and acquire rights to such intellectual property through a license or otherwise (including pursuant to any settlement agreement); provided, that, if Licensor declines to exercise such right, Licensor shall promptly
inform Licensee thereof and Licensee shall have the right to conduct such negotiations and acquire such rights and to deduct, subject to Section 8.3.5, any and all payments made to any Third Party under this Section 9.2(c) against any
 [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  to be made by Licensee to Licensor under this Agreement, provided, however, that in no event shall such offset reduce any payment to be made to Licensor hereunder by more than  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  of the amount otherwise
payable.    (d) Licensee shall, subject to Section 8.3.5, have the right to offset against  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  to be made by Licensee to
Licensor under this Agreement  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  of all costs and expenses (for clarity, not including any settlement costs or damages) incurred in defending any suit or action by a Third Party that claims that the use, Manufacture or
Commercialization of the Compound and/or the Product (as the Compound and/or the Product (i) are described and/or claimed in the Licensor Patents and (ii) are being Developed and Manufactured by or on behalf of Licensor as of the Effective Date)
infringes any issued patent claim in a Third Party s Patent covering the use of the Compound or of the Product in the Target Indication or Second Indication.  
  9.3 Infringement or Invalidation Actions by Third Parties.   
 (a)  Notice.    If either Party becomes aware, or otherwise receives notice, of any patent nullity, invalidity or unenforceability
actions, any declaratory judgment actions, or any alleged or threatened infringement, in each case, of or involving any Licensor Patents, including, any claims arising under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public  Law 98-417),  as amended, or its equivalent in a country other than the United States it will promptly (but in any case no later than five (5) Business Days from becoming aware of any such action) notify in
writing the other Party thereof.    (b)  Enforcement of Patents.   
 (i)  Licensee Action.  Licensee shall have the first right to initiate a suit or take other appropriate action it believes is required
against any Third Party with respect to infringement or misappropriation of the Licensor Technology, after having conferred

A request for confidential treatment has been made with respect to portions of the following document
that are marked with [*CONFIDENTIAL*]. The redacted portions have been filed separately with the SEC.       
  
with Licensor. Licensee shall have the right to be assisted by and cooperate with its local Affiliates and/or Sublicensees if this is deemed useful or appropriate by Licensee in the interest
of an effective enforcement of rights.    (ii)  Licensor Action.  If Licensee fails to institute such litigation or otherwise take
steps to remedy the applicable infringement within thirty (30) days of the date that Licensee becomes aware of such action or infringement (including by way of the Licensor providing notice thereof pursuant to Section 9.3(a)), then Licensor will
have the right (but not the obligation), at its own expense, to bring any such suit, action or proceeding by counsel of its own choice.  
 (c)  Cooperation; Costs; Damages.   
 (i) If one Party brings any suit, action or proceeding under Section 9.3(b), the other Party agrees to be joined as party plaintiff if
necessary to prosecute the suit, action or proceeding and to give the first Party authority to file, prosecute and control the suit, action or proceeding; provided, however, that neither Party will be required to transfer any right, title or
interest in or to any property to the other Party or any other party to confer standing on a Party hereunder, and provided further that such other Party shall in any case have the right to be represented by its own counsel at its cost and expense.
   (ii) The Party not pursuing the suit, action or proceeding hereunder will provide reasonable assistance to the other Party, including by
executing any and all reasonably necessary documents as may be required to bring such suit, action or proceeding, providing access to relevant documents and other evidence and making its employees available, subject to the other Party s
reimbursement of any reasonable external costs incurred by the non-enforcing or defending Party in providing such assistance.    (iii) The
Party initiating the suit, action or proceeding under Section 9.3(b) shall assume and pay all costs and expenses related thereto, including fees and expenses of counsel selected by it and shall have control over the suit, action or proceeding;
provided, that (A) in the case of any such suit, action or proceeding  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , then the other Party shall reimburse to the Party initiating the action  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , or (B) in the case of any such suit, action or proceeding
in countries other than  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , then the other Party shall reimburse to the Party initiating the action  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  of all documented external fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with such suit, action or
proceeding, such reimbursement payment to be made on a quarterly basis within  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  of submission by the Party initiating the suit of the relevant invoice and accompanying documentation, provided however that if Licensee is the
Party initiating the action, then Licensor s reimbursement of  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  or  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] , as applicable, of all reasonable, documented external fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with such suit, action or
proceeding shall be effected by Licensee deducting such amounts from  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  otherwise payable to Licensor hereunder in connection with Net Sales, or  [*CONFIDENTIAL*],  in the country in which such action under this Section 9.3
is pursued (and subject to Section 8.3.5).  [*CONFIDENTIAL*].

A request for confidential treatment has been made with respect to portions of the following document
that are marked with [*CONFIDENTIAL*]. The redacted portions have been filed separately with the SEC.       
  (iv) The Party controlling an action shall not, without the prior written consent of the
non-controlling Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), enter into any compromise or settlement relating to any claim, suit or action that it brought under Section 9.3 that admits the invalidity or unenforceability of any Licensor Patent,
or requires the non-controlling Party to pay any sum of money, or otherwise adversely affects the rights of the non-controlling Party hereunder (including the rights to receive payments), provided however that this sub-section (iv) shall not apply
in the event Licensor has exercised its right to  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] .    (v) Any settlements, damages or other monetary awards (a
    Recovery    ) recovered pursuant to a suit, action or proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 9.3 will be allocated between the Parties  pro rata  based on the respective costs and expenses incurred by each
Party with respect thereto; provided, that, Licensor shall not share in any such Recovery if Licensor has  [*CONFIDENTIAL*] .  
  9.4   Patent Term Extensions.    Licensee and Licensor shall cooperate in good faith throughout the Territory in filing
for and obtaining patent term extensions and supplementary or complementary protection certificates, if available, in respect of the Licensor Patents. Such cooperation may include: (i) advising each other in a timely manner of any action by any
Regulatory or other competent Governmental Authority that is pertinent to any such extension; (ii) reasonably supplying each other with all information in its control pertaining to the extension of any such Licensor Patent; (iii) cooperating with

Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses) (collectively,
    Losses    ) arising in connection with any and all charges, complaints, actions, suits, proceedings, hearings, investigations, claims, demands, judgments, orders, decrees, stipulations or injunctions by a Third Party
(each a     Claim    ) to the extent resulting or otherwise arising from (i) any breach by Licensor of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) the negligence or
willful misconduct by Licensor or its Affiliates, sublicensees or subcontractors or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or consultants in performing any obligations under this Agreement or under any other agreement which may have
an impact on the Licensor Technology, the Compound, or Royalty Products, except to the extent such Losses as are caused by instructions provided by Licensee and implemented by Licensor.  
  11.2   Indemnification by Licensee.    Licensee hereby agrees to save, indemnify, defend and hold Licensor, its
Affiliates, and their respective directors, agents and employees harmless from and against any and all Losses arising in connection with any and all Claims to the extent resulting or otherwise arising from (i) any breach by Licensee of any of its

A request for confidential treatment has been made with respect to portions of the following document
that are marked with [*CONFIDENTIAL*]. The redacted portions have been filed separately with the SEC.       
  
Third Party (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 11.3.1 shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except and only to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice). Within thirty (30) days after delivery of
such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If a Party believes that a Claim
presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Party seeking indemnification is not entitled to indemnification under, as applicable, Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, it shall so notify the Party seeking indemnification.  
  11.3.2  If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at
its own expense; provided, that if the interests of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Claim are sufficiently adverse to prohibit the representation by the same counsel of both Parties under Applicable Law, ethical
rules or equitable principles, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith.  
  11.3.3  The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of such Claim and the defense thereof and shall
consider recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto.     11.3.4  The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any
settlement of such Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Claim or consent to any judgment in respect thereof
that does not include a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto or that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party or adversely affects the Indemnified Party without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.     11.3.5  For clarity, neither Party shall
have any indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 to the extent the applicable Claim results or otherwise arises from the breach of this Agreement, negligence, or willful misconduct of the other Party or its Affiliates,
sublicensees or subcontractors or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or consultants.     11.4   Limitation of
Liability.    NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, OR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF

  11.5   Insurance.  Each Party shall procure and maintain insurance, including, as applicable, clinical trials insurance and
product liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations hereunder and which is consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated at all times during which the Compound or Product is being clinically tested in

 (a) each Party shall procure and maintain clinical trials insurance coverage, which prior to the First Commercial Sale of the Product, shall
be in accordance with the minimum requirements by Applicable Law and industry standards in each country where the clinical trials are carried out; and  
 (b) Licensee shall procure and maintain product liability insurance coverage, which upon First Commercial Sale of the Product, shall in no
event be less than  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  per loss occurrence and  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  in the aggregate.    It is understood that such insurance shall
not be construed to create a limit of a Party s liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 11. Each Party shall provide the other Party with written evidence of such insurance prior to commencement of this
Agreement and upon expiration of any one (1) coverage. Each Party shall provide the other Party with written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in such insurance or self - insurance
which materially adversely affects the rights of the other Party hereunder.     ARTICLE 12   
  CONFIDENTIALITY      12.1
Confidential Information.      12.1.1  The Parties agree that during the Term, and for a period of  [*CONFIDENTIAL*]  years
thereafter, a Party receiving Confidential Information of the other Party will (X) maintain in confidence such Confidential Information to the same extent such Party maintains its own proprietary information of similar kind and value, and, in any
event, no less than a reasonable standard of care, (Y) not disclose such Confidential Information to any Third Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as otherwise expressly permitted below   and, in the case of
Licensee, except as necessary or useful for a proper and full performance of its rights and obligations hereunder, and (Z) not use such Confidential Information for any purpose except those permitted by this Agreement. As used herein, 
     Confidential Information     means all Know-How and other information and materials received by either Party from the other Party or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement. The foregoing obligations and the
other obligations set forth in this Section 12.1 shall not apply with respect to any portion of such Confidential Information which:  
      44  

A request for confidential treatment has been made with respect to portions of the following document
that are marked with [*CONFIDENTIAL*]. The redacted portions have been filed separately with the SEC.       
  (a) is publicly disclosed by the disclosing Party, either before or after it becomes known to
the receiving Party;    (b) was known to the receiving Party or any or its Affiliates, without any obligation to keep it confidential, prior
to when it was received from the disclosing Party;    (c) is subsequently disclosed to the receiving Party or any of its Affiliates by a
Third Party that is lawfully in possession thereof without obligation to keep it confidential;    (d) has been published by a Third Party or
otherwise enters the public domain through no fault of the receiving Party or any of its Affiliates in breach of this Agreement; or    (e)
has been independently developed or acquired by the receiving Party or any of its Affiliates without the aid, application or use of the disclosing Party s Confidential Information.  
 Notwithstanding clauses (a) through (e) above, both Parties shall be bound to the obligations of this Article 12 (as the receiving Party hereunder) with
respect to all Licensor Know-How to the extent such Licensor Know-How (i) was confidential prior to the Effective Date and (ii) specifically relates to the Compound or Product.  
  12.1.2  The receiving Party shall have the right to disclose any Confidential Information provided by the other Party hereunder if, in
the reasonable opinion of the receiving Party s legal counsel, such disclosure is necessary to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or the requirements of any law or rule imposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
or any securities exchange or other Applicable Law, but only to the extent of such necessity or requirements; and no such disclosure shall cause any such information to cease to be Confidential Information hereunder, except to the extent such
disclosure results in a public disclosure of such information. Where reasonably possible, the receiving Party shall notify the disclosing Party of the receiving Party s intent to make such disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to
the preceding sentence sufficiently prior to making such disclosure so as to allow the disclosing Party adequate time to take whatever action the disclosing Party may deem to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential
Information.     12.1.3  Except as set forth above, each Party agrees that it shall provide or permit access to Confidential
Information of the other Party only to (i) the receiving Party s attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors for the sole purpose of enabling such attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors to provide advice to the
receiving Party and (ii) the receiving Party s Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, and to the directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors
and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees, subdistributors and other Third Parties, who have a need to know such Confidential Information to assist the receiving Party with the activities contemplated or required of it by this Agreement; provided
 
      45  

A request for confidential treatment has been made with respect to portions of the following document
that are marked with [*CONFIDENTIAL*]. The redacted portions have been filed separately with the SEC.       
  
that in each case the Person to whom Confidential Information is being disclosed is subject to obligations of confidentiality and non-use with respect to such Confidential Information
substantially similar to the obligations of confidentiality and nonuse of the receiving Party pursuant to this Section 12.1; and provided further, that each Party shall remain responsible for any failure by its attorneys, independent accountants and
financial advisors, Affiliates, and its and its Affiliates  respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, to treat such Confidential Information as required
under this Section 12.1.    For clarity, either Party may disclose without any limitation such Party s U.S. federal income tax treatment and the U.S.
federal income tax structure of the transactions relating to such Party that are based on or derived from this Agreement, as well as all materials of any kind (including opinions, other tax analyses, or a complete copy of this Agreement and any
amendments thereto) relating to such tax treatment or tax structure, except to the extent that nondisclosure of such matters is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.  
  12.1.4  Each Party acknowledges that a Party in breach of any of its obligations under this Section 12.1 may cause the non-breaching
Party irreparable harm, for which monetary damages will be an inadequate remedy. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement in the event of any such breach, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled, in addition to
any other remedy available to it under this Agreement, at law or in equity, to seek injunctive relief, including an accounting for profits, specific performance of the terms hereof and other equitable relief for such breach, without the posting of
bond or other security.     12.2   Publicity.  Any press releases or other public statements or disclosures regarding the subject
matter of this Agreement shall be subject to the express prior written consent of each of the Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that a disclosure shall be permitted without the other Party s consent
to the extent that it does not contain information beyond that included in a prior disclosure approved in writing by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any disclosure which is required by Applicable Law or the rules of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission or any securities exchange, as reasonably advised by the disclosing Party s counsel, may be made without the prior consent of the other Party, although, prior to making any such legally required disclosure,
the Party making such disclosure shall give the other Party prompt notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure.  
  12.3   Securities Filings.  In the event Licensee proposes to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or the
securities regulators of any state or other jurisdiction under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other applicable securities law a registration statement or any other disclosure document
which describes or refers to this Agreement, including filing a copy of this Agreement itself, Licensee shall notify Licensor of such intention and shall provide Licensor with a copy of relevant portions of the proposed filing not less than three
(3) Business Days prior to such filing (or such shorter period of time as may be required in the circumstances, and any revisions to such portions of the proposed filing a reasonable time prior to the filing thereof), and shall use

concerning Licensee that Licensee reasonably requests be kept confidential, consistent with Licensor s disclosure obligations under applicable securities laws. For clarity, in no event shall Licensor be obligated to delay or withhold such
a filing in order to comply with the foregoing sentence if such compliance would result in Licensor being in violation of any Applicable Law.  
  12.4 Publications.   
  12.4.1  Licensee shall be free at all times to make publications or presentations with regard to the Compound and/or the Product, as it

with a publication strategy plan and (b) a copy of said publications or material presentations intended to be given to a public international audience for Licensor s information reasonably prior to the public disclosure thereof.  
  12.4.2  The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain Third Parties counterparties to the agreements included in the Licensor s
data room prior to the Effective Date may have been granted publication rights related to the Compound and Product, and publications by such Persons in compliance with the provisions of the relevant agreements shall be permitted; provided, that
Licensor shall advise Licensee reasonably prior to the public disclosure thereof regarding any anticipated publications by such Persons.  
  12.5   Use of Names.  Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, neither Party shall use the name of the other Party in
relation to this transaction in any public announcement, press release or other public document without the written consent of such other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that subject to Section 12.2,

Parties  actions in connection therewith).     13.3   Claims for damages . Without limitation of any other remedy
available hereunder, nothing in this Agreement shall limit a Party s right to bring a claim for damages in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the other Party.

the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Exchange Act, as presently in effect. Seller understands that the shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued by Purchaser as part of the Closing Stock Payment and Milestone Stock Payment are

securities may be resold without registration under the Securities Act, only in certain limited circumstances. Seller acknowledges that the Purchaser Common Stock is being purchased for investment and not with a view towards a distribution. Seller
further acknowledges that Seller has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of acquiring the Purchaser Common Stock. Seller understands that any shares issued as part of
the Closing Stock Payment and the Milestone Stock Payment may bear the following or a similar legend:     THE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED, OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS

condition, and to Seller s Knowledge no event or condition is threatened, that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Purchased Assets.

as liabilities in the financial statements of Seller but which are in the nature of accrued (and undeclared) dividends on preference shares or amounts payable to preference shareholders on a redemption of preference shares in Seller or a liquidation
of Seller). As used in this Section,  insolvent  means that the sum of the debts and other Liabilities of Seller (excluding any amounts reflected as liabilities in the financial statements of Seller but which are in the nature of
accrued (and undeclared) dividends on preference shares or amounts payable to preference shareholders on a redemption of preference shares in Seller or a liquidation of Seller) exceeds the present fair saleable value of Seller s assets.

respect to the Purchaser SEC Reports that would reasonably be expected to delay Purchaser s performance of its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, none of the Purchaser SEC Reports is the

during regular business hours and subject to reasonable notice, to the Purchased Assets and consultants of Seller with knowledge of the Purchased Assets;  provided ,  however , that Purchaser acknowledges that Seller has no employees and
may have as few as one consultant available for such purpose, and such lack of personnel shall neither constitute a breach of this Agreement by Seller nor be a condition to Purchaser s obligation to effect the Closing; (ii) furnish Purchaser
with copies of such documentation and information held by or under the control of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and related to the Purchased Assets as Purchaser may reasonably request; and (iii) instruct the employees of Seller, and its counsel

Agreement to be or become untrue in any material respect or intentionally omit to take any action necessary to prevent any such representation or warranty from being untrue in any material respect at such time; and

directly or indirectly, to any Person (other than Purchaser and its Representatives) any confidential information concerning the Purchased Assets except as necessary to comply with its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. 
  (b)  The parties acknowledge that there may be no adequate remedy at Law for a breach of Section 5.3(a) and that money damages may not
be an appropriate remedy for breach of such Section. Therefore, the parties agree that Purchaser has the right to injunctive relief and specific performance of Section 5.3(a) in the event of any breach of such Section in addition to any rights
it may have for damages.     5.4 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.  From the date of signing of this Agreement until the earlier of

Material Adverse Effect qualification in such representation or warranty), or (C) has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Article 6 to be satisfied; (ii) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement; (iii) any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement; and (iv) any Claim commenced or, to Seller s Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise

  (b)  Purchaser s receipt of information pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty or agreement given or made by Seller in this Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement and shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Seller Disclosure Schedules. Should any such fact or condition require any
change to the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller shall promptly deliver to Purchaser a supplement to the Seller Disclosure Schedule specifying such change. Such delivery shall not affect any rights of Purchaser under this Agreement; provided
that to the extent such update relates to a matter that occurred after the execution of this Agreement (and that should not have otherwise been set forth on the Schedules as of the execution of this Agreement) that results in any breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller that but for this Section 5.6 would entitle Purchaser to not consummate the Closing (a   Termination Update  ), and, to the extent such breach is not cured by Seller prior to the Closing Date,
Purchaser may terminate this Agreement

remedies against Seller to which Purchaser might otherwise be entitled in respect of a breach that would be cured by such Termination Update. For clarity, if Purchaser proceeds to consummate the Closing after receiving any update or information
other than a Termination Update, Purchaser shall be entitled to exercise any rights or remedies pursuant to this Agreement in respect of a breach that would be cured by such update, including any rights or remedies under Article 8, and such update
shall not be effective to cure and correct for any purpose any such breach of any representation, warranty or covenant which would have existed if Seller had not provided such update. 
  (c)  Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing if it becomes aware of any
fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or taking of which (i) has caused in, or would reasonably be expected to cause, any representation or warranty made by Purchaser hereunder to be untrue or inaccurate, or (ii) has caused,
or would reasonably be expected to cause, any covenant or agreement of Purchaser hereunder not to be complied with. No such notification shall affect the representations or warranties of Purchaser, or Seller s right to rely thereon, or the
conditions to the obligations of Seller.     ARTICLE 6

of notification of the Third Party Claim, including a description of the factual basis of the Third Party Claim and shall indicate the amount of the Damages. Thereafter, Purchaser shall

Seller may reasonably request in investigating, defending and, subject to the terms set forth above, settling such Third Party Claim. If Seller elects not to defend a Third-Party Claim, is not permitted to defend such Third Party Claim or fails
to notify Purchaser of its election as herein provided, Purchaser may pay, compromise, settle or defend such Third-Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of Seller if Seller is determined to be liable to Purchaser hereunder,  provided ,
 however , that no such payment in compromise or settlement of, or other compromise or settlement of, may be effected by Purchaser without Seller s consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In any event, Seller
shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in any defense of such Third Party Claim with the consent of Purchaser which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  
  8.5 Limitation of Claims.  
  (a)  The Liability of Seller for indemnifiable Damages pursuant to Section 8.2(a) shall not be payable unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Damages suffered or incurred by the Purchaser Indemnitees collectively exceeds one hundred thousand U.S. dollars ($100,000); thereafter, a Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek compensation for Damages, and Seller shall be
responsible for the payment of Damages to the extent in excess of one hundred thousand U.S. dollars ($100,000). The aggregate liability of Seller for indemnifiable Damages pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and Section 8.2(b) hereof shall in no event

Value of the Milestone Stock Payment) as of the date of the final non-appealable determination of such Damages (the   Indemnification Cap  ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations on Damages set forth in

A request for confidential treatment has been made with respect to portions of the following document

resolution of any claim for indemnification in accordance with this Agreement, set off, against any unpaid Milestone Payment or Contingent Earnouts, Damages up to the Indemnification Cap (with any set-off against the Milestone Stock Payment valued
based upon the Transaction Value of the Milestone Stock Payment) (the   Set-Off Right  ). In the event that Seller delivers a Notice of Claim seeking Damages in excess of the Indemnification Cap and the Indemnification Cap
subsequently increases to a greater value as a result of the occurrence of a Milestone and the related obligation of a Milestone Payment or Contingent Earnouts, Purchaser shall thereafter be entitled to received additional Damages or set off Damages
in the amount of the subsequently increased Indemnification Cap.    (b)  The aggregate liability of Purchaser for indemnifiable Damages
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) hereof shall in no event exceed the Transaction Value of the Closing Stock Payment and any Milestone Stock Payment if actually paid and delivered.  
  (c)  The right to indemnification under this Article 8 and the Set-Off Right shall constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of
the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees for Damages or otherwise arising from or in connection with this Agreement, including pursuant to Section 8.2 and the Transaction Documents or otherwise with respect to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.     8.6 Objections to Claims.  In case Seller shall object in writing to any claim or claims by a Purchaser
Indemnitee made in any Notice of Claim, Purchaser Indemnitee shall have twenty (20) Business Days following the receipt of such written objection to respond in a written statement to the objection of Seller. If after such twenty (20) Business
Day period there remains a dispute as to any claims, Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30) Business Days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If Seller and Purchaser
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared by Purchaser and signed by Purchaser and Seller.    8.7
Resolution of Conflicts.  If no agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation between the parties pursuant to Section 8.6, Purchaser or Seller may initiate formal legal action pursuant to Section 10.6 of this Agreement to resolve

are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of
this Agreement.     10.8 Counterparts; Facsimiles.  This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by electronic or
facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same agreement.     10.9 Entire Agreement.  This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto), the
Transaction Documents executed in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, and the Confidentiality Agreement (as amended by this Agreement), contain the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
related transactions and supersede all prior agreements, written or oral, with respect thereto.    10.10 Disclosure

the Company the Shares.    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, representations, warranties, covenants and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

the representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall issue and sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from the Company, the Shares free and

disclosure is applicable to qualify such representation or warranty, and to the extent specifically referenced in the applicable representation or warranty, disclosures in the SEC Filings (as defined below) and the statements contained in this
 Section 2  are true, complete and correct (except that those statements which address matters only as of a particular date are true, correct and complete as of such date). The Company shall deliver an updated and current Company

described in the SEC Filings. The Company is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify would or would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties or financial condition of the Company, (ii) the Shares or (iii) the enforceability of this Agreement (a   Material Adverse Effect    provided  that none of

industries in which the Company or its subsidiaries operates generally or the United States or European economy generally, financial markets or political conditions generally; (c) any act of terrorism, military action or war (whether or not
declared), national or international calamity or similar event or any escalation or worsening thereof; (d) any event, circumstance, change or effect arising from or relating to any change in legal requirements or generally accepted accounting
principles (  GAAP  ) (or interpretations of any legal requirements or GAAP); or (e) any change or effect attributable to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or the public announcement of the execution of,
this Agreement (provided any such public announcement is not in breach of this Agreement);  provided,  in each case, that such effects do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially disproportionate adverse impact on the Company,
taken as a whole, relative to any other  person  as such term is defined under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the   Exchange Act  ) and as used in Sections 13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of
the Exchange Act (  Person  ) in the industries or markets in which the Company operates.     2.2  Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws .  The certificate of incorporation, bylaws and documents of similar substance (the   Governing Documents  ) of the Company and its subsidiaries that are on file with the United States Securities and

subsidiary of the Company are in compliance with the terms of their respective Governing Documents.     2.3  Capitalization . 
   (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 113,100,000 shares of capital stock, of which 113,000,000 shares are
designated as Common Stock and 100,000 shares are designated as preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share (  Preferred Stock  ). As of the close of business on the date that is two Trading Days prior to the date of this Agreement,
(i) 34,155,997 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which were validly issued and fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights; (ii) 5,063,612 shares of Common Stock were issuable (and such number was
reserved for issuance) upon exercise of options to purchase Common Stock or as restricted stock units payable in Common Stock (the   Options  ) outstanding as of such date; (iii) 3,761,407 shares of Common Stock were issuable
(and such number was reserved for issuance) upon exercise of warrants to purchase Common Stock (the   Warrants  ) outstanding as of such date; and (iv) no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding.  
 (b) As of the close of business on the last Trading Day immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, except for (i) the Options and
(ii) the Warrants, there were no options, warrants or other rights to acquire capital stock or other equity interests from the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock or other equity interests. Other than
(A) shares of capital stock reserved for issuance as provided in this  Section 2.3  and (B) options to purchase Common Stock or other equity awards issued in accordance with the Company s Amended and Restated 2008 Omnibus
Equity Compensation Plan (the   Awards  ), the Company has not issued any shares of its capital stock or other equity interests, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock or other equity

interests except as set forth in its filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (  Securities Act  ) and the Exchange Act. All outstanding shares of Common Stock and all
shares of Common Stock subject to issuance upon exercise of the Options, the Awards and the Warrants, upon issuance prior to the Closing on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. The Shares to be issued in connection with the Agreement, when issued as contemplated herein, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,
will not be in violation of any preemptive rights and will be free and clear of all liens, charges, restrictions, claims, rights of first refusal and encumbrances except as set forth in this Agreement and the Company s Governing Documents. The
issuance and sale of the Shares will not obligate the Company to issue shares of Common Stock or other securities to any Person (other than the Purchaser) and will not result in a right of any holder of Company securities to adjust the exercise,
conversion, exchange or reset price under any of such securities.     2.4  Authorization; Enforceability.    
 (a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform, as applicable, this Agreement and to issue
and sell the Shares in accordance with the terms hereof.    (b) All corporate action on the part of the Company and its officers and
directors necessary for (i) the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of all obligations of the Company under this Agreement, (ii) the issuance and sale by the Company of the Shares hereunder and (iii) the listing of the
Shares on the NASDAQ Global market, in each case have been taken. This Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors  rights generally or by equitable principles (the   Equitable Exceptions  ). No action on the part of the Company s

amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, applicable to such SEC Filing, and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or at the time it became effective in the case of registration statements), or, if amended, as of the date

were made, not misleading.    (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any notes thereto) contained in
the SEC Filings, as amended, supplemented or restated, if applicable, was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, as permitted by the

under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time frames specified by the SEC s rules and forms (and such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably effective), and has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of its system of internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company s independent registered accountant and the audit committee of the Board of Directors (A) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses to the Company s knowledge in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) and (B) to the Company s knowledge any

this Agreement, or (ii) where failure to obtain such consents, approvals,  

authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

relating to the hiring of employees, consultants and advisors and the employment of labor, including provisions thereof relating to wages, hours, equal opportunity, collective bargaining and the payment of social security and other taxes. The

officer, other officer of the Company participating in the offering contemplated hereby, any beneficial owner of 20% or more of the Company s outstanding voting equity securities, calculated on the basis of voting power, nor any promoter (as
that term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) connected with the Company in any capacity at the time of sale is disqualified from relying on Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities Act (  Rule 506  ) for
any of the reasons stated in Rule 506(d) in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. The Company has exercised reasonable care, including without limitation, conducting a factual inquiry that is

expected to occur or exist with respect to the Company or its business, properties, operations, assets or financial condition, that would be required to be disclosed by the Company under applicable securities laws if the Company were publicly

below); or (ii) an issuer tender offer by the Company;  provided,  that in the event that the tender offer is not completed, the Shares shall remain subject to the restrictions contained in this  Section 6.1 . For the purposes of this
Agreement, a   Change of Control   means the transfer, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons, of shares of capital stock of the Company if, after such transfer, the
stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such transfer do not own at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting securities of the Company (or the surviving entity).  
 (d) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that stop transfer instructions will be given to the Company s transfer agent with respect to the
Shares until the expiration of the Lock-Up Period.  

6.2  Notifications .   
 (a) Prior to the Closing, the Company will promptly advise Purchaser in writing of any notice or other communication from any third Person
alleging that the consent of a third Person is required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.    (b) Prior to
the Closing, each party shall promptly notify the other of any action, suit or proceeding that is instituted or specifically threatened in writing against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.     6.3  Standstill .  During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the earliest
of (i) three (3) years following the Closing Date, (ii) the date on which any third party unaffiliated with Purchaser commences a tender offer or exchange offer for more than fifty percent (50%) of the Company s outstanding
Common Stock, and (iii) the date the Company publicly announces its intent to consummate a Change of Control (the   Standstill Period  ), neither the Purchaser nor any of Purchaser s representatives or affiliates will, in
any manner, directly or indirectly:    (a) make, effect, initiate or cause (i) any acquisition of beneficial ownership of any
securities of the Company or any securities of any subsidiary or other affiliate of the Company to the extent that such acquisition would result in Purchaser s beneficial ownership of the Company exceeding 15%, (ii) any acquisition of any
assets of the Company or any assets of any subsidiary or other affiliate of the Company, (iii) any tender offer, exchange offer, merger, business combination, recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or extraordinary
transaction involving the Company or any subsidiary or other affiliate of the Company, or involving any securities or assets of the Company or any securities or assets of any subsidiary or other affiliate of the Company or (iv) any
 solicitation  of  proxies  (as those terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents with respect to any securities of the Company;  provided, however,  that notwithstanding the
provisions of this  Section 6.3(a)(i) , if the number of shares of then outstanding Common Stock of the Company is reduced or if the ownership percentage of Purchaser is increased as a result of a repurchase by the Company of shares of
Common Stock, or a stock split, stock dividend or a recapitalization of the Company, Purchaser shall not be required to dispose of its holdings of shares of the Common Stock even though such action resulted in Purchaser s beneficial ownership
increasing;    (b) form, join or participate in a  group  (as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder)
with respect to the beneficial ownership of any securities of the Company;    (c) act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control
or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company;    (d) take any action that might require the Company to make a
public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in clause  (a)  of this  Section 6.3 ;    (e) agree or
offer to take, or encourage or propose (publicly or otherwise) the taking of, any action referred to in clause  (a) ,  (b) ,  (c)  or  (d)  of this sentence;  
 (f) assist, induce or encourage any other Person to take any action of the type referred to in clause  (a) ,  (b) ,
 (c) ,  (d)  or  (e)  of this sentence;    (g) enter into any discussions, negotiations, arrangement or
agreement with any other Person relating to any of the foregoing; or  

(h) request or propose that the Company amend, waive or consider the amendment or waiver of any
provision set forth in this  Section 6.3 .    Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that Purchaser shall not
be prohibited from entering into an agreement and having discussions with legal, accounting or financial advisors for the limited purposes of evaluating any of the transactions contemplated by this  Section 6.3 , and Purchaser may initiate
private discussions with, and submit proposals confidentially to, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company regarding a transaction otherwise prohibited by this  Section 6.3 ;  provided, however,  that any such proposal shall be
expressly conditioned on approval of the Board of Directors and will not require public disclosure.     6.4  Commercial Reasonable
Efforts .  Each Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy in a timely fashion each of the conditions to be satisfied by it under  Section 4  and  Section 5  of this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall take all action necessary to (i) cause the lawful issuance of the Shares in accordance with this Agreement at Closing and (ii) make all filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission necessary to permit
Purchaser to sell Shares in accordance with Rule 144.     6.5  Notice of Issuances .  In the event the Company intends to issues
shares of capital stock (other than in connection with the issuance of shares of capital stock upon the exercise of employee options), the Company shall notify Purchaser to the extent legally permitted to do so.  
  6.6  Securities Laws Disclosure; Publicity .  The Company shall, by 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Trading Day immediately
following the date hereof, issue a press release disclosing the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall, within four (4) Trading Days following the date hereof, file a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing the material
terms of the transactions contemplated hereby and including this Agreement as an exhibit thereto. The Company and Purchaser shall consult with each other regarding the substance of any public disclosure by either party regarding this Agreement
(including the filing of the Agreement as an exhibit to a periodic filing with the SEC) and regarding the issuance of any other press releases with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither the Company nor Purchaser shall issue
any such press release nor otherwise make any such public statement without the prior consent of the Company, with respect to any press release of Purchaser, or without the prior consent of Purchaser, with respect to any press release of the
Company, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, except if such disclosure is required by law, in which case the disclosing party shall promptly provide the other party with prior notice of such public statement or
communication.     6.7  Shareholder Rights Plan .  No claim will be made or enforced by the Company or, with the consent of the
Company, any other Person, that Purchaser is an  Acquiring Person  under any control share acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including any distribution under a rights agreement) or similar anti-takeover plan or arrangement in
effect or hereafter adopted by the Company, or that Purchaser could be deemed to trigger the provisions of any such plan or arrangement, by virtue of receiving Shares under this Agreement or under any other agreement among the Company and Purchaser.
    6.8  Indemnification of Purchaser .  Subject to the provisions of this  Section 6.7 , the Company will indemnify and
hold Purchaser and its directors, officers, shareholders, members, partners, employees and agents (and any other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title),
each Person who controls Purchaser (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, shareholders, agents, members, partners or employees (and any other Persons with a
functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title) of such controlling persons (each, a   Purchaser Party  ) harmless from any and all losses, liabilities,
obligations, claims,  

contingencies, damages, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys  fees and costs of investigation that any such
Purchaser Party may suffer or incur as a result of the Company s breach of its representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement (unless such action is based upon a breach of Purchaser s representation set forth in Section
3.2). If any action shall be brought against any Purchaser Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, such Purchaser Party shall promptly notify the Company in writing, provided that the failure to so notify the
Company shall not prejudice the Purchaser Party s right to indemnification except to the extent the Company is materially prejudiced thereby), and the Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser Party. Any Purchaser Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
Purchaser Party except to the extent that (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Company has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to employ counsel or
(iii) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of counsel, a material conflict on any material issue between the position of the Company and the position of such Purchaser Party, in which case the Company shall be responsible for the
reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one such separate counsel for all Purchaser Parties entitled to indemnification hereunder. The Company will not be liable to any Purchaser Party under this Agreement (y) for any settlement by a
Purchaser Party effected without the Company s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; or (z) to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to any
Purchaser Party s breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by such Purchaser Party in this Agreement. The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to any cause of action or similar right
of any Purchaser Party against the Company and any liabilities that the Company may be subject to pursuant to law. The Company will have the exclusive right to settle any claim or proceeding, provided that the Company will not settle any such claim,
action or proceeding without the prior written consent of the Purchaser Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that such consent shall not be required if the settlement includes a full and unconditional release
satisfactory to the Purchaser Party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim or proceeding and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Purchaser Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Company s liability under this Section 6.7 exceed (i) an aggregate of $5,000,000 in connection with any claim based on a breach of the representations, warranties or covenants contained
in Sections 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.11, 2.12, 2.16 or ARTICLE 6 or (ii) an aggregate of $2,000,000 in connection with any claim based on the breach of any other provision of this Agreement.

quotation of the Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.     6.10  Form D; Blue Sky Filings .  The Company agrees to
timely file a Form D with respect to the Shares as required under Regulation D and to provide a copy thereof, promptly upon request of Purchaser. The Company shall take such action as the Company shall reasonably determine is necessary in order to
obtain an exemption for, or to qualify the Shares for, sale to Purchaser at each Closing under applicable Blue Sky Laws and shall provide evidence of such actions promptly upon request of Purchaser.  
  6.11  Book Entry Statement .  The Company hereby agrees to deliver to Purchaser a book entry statement from the Transfer Agent
showing the Shares registered in the name of Purchaser within three (3) business days of the Closing.      

7.  
  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS       All representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements of the Company hereunder shall be deemed made on and as of the Closing as though such representations, warranties, covenants and other  

agreements were made on and as of such date. All representations and warranties made by a party to this Agreement herein or pursuant hereto shall survive each Closing and the delivery of the
Shares for a period of 15 months thereafter. All covenants and other agreements made by a party to this Agreement herein or pursuant hereto shall survive until all obligations set forth therein shall have been performed or satisfied or they shall
have terminated in accordance with their terms.      

8.

 (c) by the Company if (i) any of the representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in  Section 3  of this Agreement
shall fail to be true and correct or (ii) there shall be a breach by Purchaser of any covenant of Purchaser in this Agreement that, in either case, (A) would result in the failure of a condition set forth in  Section 5 , and
(B) which is not curable or, if curable, is not cured upon the occurrence of the twentieth (20 th ) day after written notice thereof is given the Company to Purchaser;  
 (d) by Purchaser if (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in  Section 2  of this Agreement

(B) which is not curable or, if curable, is not cured upon the occurrence of the twentieth (20 th ) day after written notice thereof is given by Purchaser to the Company; or  
 (e) by either Purchaser or the Company in the event that any court of competent jurisdiction or Governmental Authority shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the actions contemplated hereby and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable.  
  8.2  Effect of Termination .  In the event of any termination of this Agreement as provided in  Section 8.1 , this
Agreement (other than  Section 9 , which shall remain in full force and effect) shall forthwith become wholly void and of no further force and effect;  provided  that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for willful
breach of this Agreement.      
    9.1  Successors and Assigns .  Except as otherwise provided herein,
the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the respective successors and permitted assigns of the parties (including any permitted transferees of any Shares). Purchaser and the Company may not assign
their respective rights or obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, except with the consent of the other party;  provided, however,  the rights and obligations of Purchaser may be assigned, without the prior written consent of the
Company, to one or more of Purchaser s affiliates. Any attempted assignment made in contravention of this Agreement shall be null and void and of no force or effect.  
  9.2  Entire Agreement .  This Agreement and the documents, schedules and exhibits referred to herein or therein constitute the
entire agreement between the parties and supersede all prior  

communications, representations, understandings and agreements of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. No party shall be liable or bound to any other party in any
manner by any warranties, representations or covenants except as specifically set forth herein or therein. All schedules and exhibits hereto are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to

  9.3  General Interpretation .  The terms of this Agreement have been negotiated by the parties hereto and the language used in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent. This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction against the party causing such instrument or
any portion thereof to be drafted, or in favor of the party receiving a particular benefit under this Agreement. No rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person.  
  9.4  Injunctive Relief .  Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that, in view of the uniqueness of the Shares, damages at
law would be insufficient for any breach by Purchaser or the Company of any of their respective covenants in this Agreement. Accordingly, each party agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the other party of any provisions of
this Agreement, the non-breaching party be entitled to seek equitable relief in the form of an order to specifically perform or an injunction to prevent irreparable injury.

determined to be illegal, unenforceable or invalid in whole or in part for any reason, such illegal, unenforceable or invalid provisions or party thereof shall be stricken from this Agreement, and such provision shall not affect the legality,
enforceability or validity of the remainder of this Agreement. If any provision or part thereof of this Agreement is stricken in accordance with the provisions of this  Section 9.9 , then such stricken

provision shall be replaced, to extent possible, with a legal, enforceable and valid provision that is as similar in tenor to the stricken provision as is legally possible.
