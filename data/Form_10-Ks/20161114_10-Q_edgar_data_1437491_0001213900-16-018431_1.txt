  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)  

  (DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS,
EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)  

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

The Company applies the guidance of Topic 810
 Consolidation  of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) to determine whether and how to consolidate another entity. Pursuant to ASC 810-10-15-10 all majority-owned
subsidiaries all entities in which a parent has a controlling financial interest shall be consolidated except when
control does not rest with the parent. Pursuant to ASC 810-10-15-8, the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is
ownership of a majority voting interest, and, therefore, as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity, directly or indirectly,
of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation. The power
to control may also exist with a lesser percentage of ownership, for example, by contract, lease, agreement with other stockholders,
or by court decree. 

Noncontrolling Interests   

In accordance with ASC 810-10-45,  Noncontrolling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements,  the Company classifies noncontrolling interests as a component of equity within
the consolidated balance sheets. In September 2016 the 35% noncontrolling interest was acquired in exchange for 525 shares of Ecoark
Holdings stock which eliminated the noncontrolling interest. 

Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations
of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). It is Management's opinion, that all material adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation. The
results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the full year. The accounting policies and procedures employed in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements
have been derived from the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which are contained
in the Company s Form S-1/A filed with the SEC on July 27, 2016. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015,
contained herein, was derived from those consolidated financial statements. As a result of the merger transaction described in
Note 2 and in accordance with ASC 805-40-45, the Company has given retroactive effect to certain share calculations by restating
amounts for common shares, additional paid-in capital and treasury shares in the December 31, 2015 balance sheet and statements
of operations. 

Reclassification   

The Company has reclassified certain amounts
in the 2015 consolidated financial statements to conform with the 2016 presentation. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are
not limited to, Management s estimate of provisions required for non-collectible accounts receivable, obsolete or slow-moving
inventory, and determination of the fair value of stock awards issued. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash   

Cash consists of cash, demand deposits
and money market funds with an original maturity of three months or less. The Company holds no cash equivalents. 

Inventory   

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or
market. Inventory cost is determined by specific identification on a first in first out basis, and provisions are made to reduce
slow-moving, obsolete, or unusable inventories to their estimated useful or scrap values. The Company establishes reserves for
this purpose. 

Property and Equipment and Long-Lived
Assets   

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation
on property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range
from three to ten years for all classes of property and equipment, except leasehold improvements which are depreciated over the
shorter of 10 years or the term of the lease. 

FASB Codification Topic 360  Property,
Plant and Equipment  ( ASC 360 ), requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and
used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. The application of ASC 360 has not materially affected the Company s reported earnings, financial
condition or cash flows.

(UNAUDITED)  

  (DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS,

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

Intangible assets with definite useful lives
are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. These intangible assets capitalized as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 represent the valuation of the Company-owned patents and customer lists. These intangible assets are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated average useful lives of thirteen and a half years for the patents and three years for
the customer lists. Expenditures on intangible assets through the Company s filing of patent and trademark protection for
Company-owned inventions are expensed as incurred. 

The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable
intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company
considers to be important which could trigger an impairment review include the following: 

1. Significant underperformance relative to expected
historical or projected future operating results; 

2. Significant changes in the manner of use of
the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and 

3. Significant negative industry or economic
trends. 

When the Company determines that the carrying
value of intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment and the
carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows, the Company records an impairment charge.
The Company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by Management
to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model. Significant management judgment is required in determining
whether an indicator of impairment exists and in projecting cash flows. The Company tested the carrying value of its intangible
assets for recoverability. The projected undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of these assets by a significant amount.
There were no impairment charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Advertising Expense   

The Company expenses advertising costs, as
incurred. Advertising expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are included in general and administrative
costs. 

Software Costs   

The Company accounts for software development
costs in accordance with ASC 985-730,  Software Research and Development , and ASC 985-20 , Costs of Software to be Sold,
Leased or Marketed . ASC 985-20 requires that costs related to the development of the Company s products   be
capitalized as an asset when incurred subsequent to the point at which technological feasibility of the enhancement is established.
ASC 985-20 specifies that  technological feasibility  can only be established by the completion of a  detailed
program design  or if no such design is prepared, upon the completion of a  working model  of the software. The
Company s development process does not include a detailed program design. Management believes that such a design could be
produced in the early stages of development but would entail significant wasted expense and delay. Consequently, ASC 985-20 requires
that development costs be recorded as an expense until the completion of a  working model . In the Company s
case, the completion of a working model does not occur until shortly before the time when the software is ready for sale. 

Research and Development Costs   

Research and development costs are expensed
as incurred. These costs include internal salaries and related costs and professional fees for activities related to development.
The majority of these costs relate to the ZEST Data Services platform. 

Subsequent Events   

Subsequent events were evaluated through the
date the consolidated financial statements were filed .  

Shipping and Handling Costs   

The Company reports shipping and handling
revenues and their associated costs in revenue and cost of revenue, respectively. Shipping revenues and costs for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were nominal and are included in cost of product sales.

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

Revenue Recognition   

Product revenue primarily consists of the sale
of recycled plastics products, electronic hardware and furniture. Revenue is recognized when the following criteria have been met: 

Evidence of an arrangement exists. 
The Company considers a customer purchase order, service agreement, contract, or equivalent document to be evidence of an arrangement. 

Delivery has occurred.  The
Company s standard transfer terms are free on board ( FOB ) shipping point. Thus, delivery is considered to have
occurred when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the time of shipment. 

The fee is fixed or determinable.
 The Company considers the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and payment terms
are standard, which is generally 30-60 days. 

Collection is deemed reasonably
assured . Collection is deemed reasonably assured if it is expected that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the
arrangement as payments become due. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, then revenue is deferred and
recognized upon cash collection. 

The Company will recognize revenues for its
software in accordance with ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition. 

Revenue from software license agreements is
recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery of the software has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable,
and collectability is probable. In software arrangements that include more than one element, the Company allocates the total arrangement
fee among the elements based on the relative fair value of each of the elements. 

License revenue allocated to software products
generally is recognized upon delivery of the products or deferred and recognized in future periods to the extent that an arrangement
includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and for which fair values have not been established. Revenue allocated
to maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance term and revenue allocated to training and other service elements
is recognized as the services are performed. If evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements of a license agreement and
post customer support ( PCS ) is the only undelivered element, then all revenue for the license arrangement is recognized
ratably over the term of the agreement as license revenue. If evidence of fair value of all undelivered PCS elements exists but
evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual
method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as
revenue. 

Cost of license revenue primarily includes
product, delivery, and royalty costs. Cost of maintenance and service revenue consists primarily of labor costs for engineers performing
implementation services, technical support, and training personnel as well as facilities and equipment costs. 

The Company enters
into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over
different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative
selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. The Company uses a
hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of
fair value ( VSOE ), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price ( ESP ). For software
elements, the Company follows the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair
value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by Management for
a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. 

ESPs are established
as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The process
for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts
and circumstances related to each deliverable.

EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)  

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

When the arrangement with a customer includes
services or significant production, modification, or customization of software, we recognize the related revenue using the percentage-of-completion
method in accordance with the accounting guidance and certain production-type contracts contained in ASC 605-35, Construction-Type
and Production-Type Contracts. We use the percentage of completion method provided all of the following conditions exist: 

the contract includes provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding goods or services to be provided and received by the parties, the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement;   

the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract;   

the Company can be expected to perform its contractual obligations; and   

reliable estimates of progress towards completion can be made.   

We measure completion based on achieving milestones
detailed in the agreements with the customers. Costs of providing services, including services accounted for in accordance with
ASC 605-35, are expensed as incurred and matched with the related revenues. 

Accounts Receivable and Concentration
of Credit Risk   

The Company considers accounts receivable,
net of allowance for returns and doubtful accounts, to be fully collectible. The allowance is based on Management s estimate
of the overall collectability of accounts receivable, considering historical losses and economic conditions. Based on these same
factors, individual accounts are charged off against the allowance when Management determines those individual accounts are uncollectible.
Credit extended to customers is generally uncollateralized. Past-due status is based on contractual terms. 

Uncertain Tax Positions   

The Company follows ASC 740-10,  Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . This requires recognition and measurement of uncertain income tax positions using a  more-likely-than-not 
approach. Management evaluates tax positions on an annual basis. 

The Company files income tax returns in the
U.S. federal tax jurisdiction and various state tax jurisdictions. The federal and state income tax returns of the Company are
subject to examination by the IRS and state taxing authorities, generally for three years after they were filed. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

The Company follows ASC 718-10   Share
Based Payments  . The Company calculates compensation expense for all awards granted, but not yet vested, based on the
grant-date fair values. Stock-based compensation expense for all awards granted is based on the grant-date fair values. The Company
recognizes these compensation costs, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, on a pro rata basis over the requisite service period
of each vesting tranche of each award. The Company considers voluntary termination behavior as well as trends of actual option
forfeitures when estimating the forfeiture rate. 

The Company measures compensation expense for
its non-employee stock-based compensation under ASC 505-50,   Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other
Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services  . The fair value of the option issued
is used to measure the transaction, as this is more reliable than the fair value of the services received. The fair value is measured
at the value of the Company s common stock on the date that the commitment for performance by the counterparty has been reached
or the counterparty s performance is complete. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to expense and
additional paid-in capital. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

ASC 825,   Financial Instruments , 
requires the Company to disclose estimated fair values for its financial instruments. Fair value estimates, methods, and assumptions
are set forth below for the Company's financial instruments: The carrying amount of cash, short-term investments (certificates
of deposit), accounts receivable, prepaid and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and accounts payable
to related parties, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments. The Company does not utilize
derivative instruments. 

Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets   

The Company reviews recoverability of long-lived
assets on a periodic basis whenever events and changes in circumstances have occurred which may indicate a possible impairment.
The assessment for potential impairment is based primarily on the Company s ability to recover the carrying value of its
long-lived assets from expected future cash flows from its operations on an undiscounted basis. If such assets are determined
to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the
assets. Fixed assets to be disposed of by sale will be carried at the lower of the then current carrying value or fair value less
estimated costs to sell.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock   

Basic net income (loss) per common share is
computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) include
additional dilution from common stock equivalents, such as convertible notes, preferred stock, stock issuable pursuant to the exercise
of stock options and warrants. Common stock equivalents are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share when
the Company reports a loss because to do so would be anti-dilutive for periods presented. 

Fair Value Measurements   

ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements  
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosure
about fair value measurements. ASC 820 classifies these inputs into the following hierarchy: 

Level 1 inputs: Quoted prices for identical
instruments in active markets. 

Level 2 inputs: Quoted prices for similar instruments
in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations
whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 

Level 3 inputs: Instruments with primarily
unobservable value drivers. 

Segment Information   

The Company follows the provisions of ASC 280-10,
  Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information .  This standard requires that companies
disclose operating segments based on the manner in which Management disaggregates the Company in making internal operating decisions.
In 2016 and 2015 the Company and its Chief Operating Decision Makers determined that the Company s operations were divided
into two segments: Products and Services. See Note 12 for segment information disclosures. 

Related Party Transactions   

Parties are considered to be related
to the Company if the parties directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under
common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal stockholders of the Company, its management, members of
the immediate families of principal stockholders of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may
deal where one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that
one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company discloses all material
related party transactions. All transactions shall be recorded at fair value of the goods or services exchanged. Property purchased
from a related party is recorded at the cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party in excess
of the cost is reflected as compensation or distribution to related parties depending on the transaction. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards   

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  . The amendments in ASU
No. 2016-09 were issued as part of the FASB's simplification initiative focused on improving areas of GAAP for which cost and complexity
may be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of information disclosed within the financial statements. The amendments
focused on simplification specifically with regard to share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification
of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance in ASU No. 2016-09 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company will evaluate the effect of ASU 2016-09 for future periods as applicable. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842) .  ASU 2016-02 changes the accounting for leased assets, principally by requiring
balance sheet recognition of assets under lease arrangements. It is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the
adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,
  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern .  The provisions of ASU 2014-15 require management
to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that
are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt,
(2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating
effect of management s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration
of management s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and
(6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be
issued). The amendments in this ASU are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods
and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial
statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in
ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , and most industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 and related ASU s issued
in 2016 are based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09
also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer
contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill
a contract. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 will be applied using one of two retrospective methods. The effective date will be the
first quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. The Company has not determined the potential effects on its consolidated
financial statements. 

There were other updates recently issued, most
of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected
to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Going Concern   

The Company commenced operations in 2007, and
has experienced typical start-up costs and losses from operations resulting in an accumulated deficit of $51,313 since inception.
The accumulated deficit as well as recurring losses of $14,726 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $10,502 and $14,135
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively and the working capital deficit of $2,153 as of December 31, 2015,
have resulted in the uncertainty of the Company to continue as a going concern even though working capital increased to a surplus
of $3,351 at September 30, 2016. 

These consolidated financial statements of
the Company have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things,
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time. 

The Company raised $17,320 of additional capital, net of expenses, in a private placement subsequent to the
reverse merger transaction on March 24, 2016 (see Note 2). The Company s ability to raise additional capital through future
equity and debt securities issuances is unknown. Obtaining additional financing, the successful development of the Company s
contemplated plan of operations, ultimately, to profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The
ability to successfully resolve these factors raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The consolidated financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of
the uncertainties.  

NOTE 2: MERGER  

On January 29, 2016, Ecoark entered into a Merger Agreement ( Merger Agreement ) with MSC providing,
among other things, for the acquisition of Ecoark by MSC in a share for share exchange pursuant to which it was contemplated that
at the closing Ecoark shareholders would own approximately 95% of the outstanding shares of MSC. On March 18, 2016, in a special
meeting called by MSC, the shareholders of MSC approved proposals necessary to complete the Merger ( Merger ). 

On March 24, 2016, the Merger was closed.
Upon the closing of the transaction, under the Merger Agreement, Magnolia Solar Acquisition Corporation merged with and into Ecoark
with Ecoark as the surviving corporation, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MSC. Thereafter, MSC changed its name to Ecoark
Holdings, Inc. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition; for accounting purposes Ecoark acquired the assets
and liabilities of Magnolia Solar effective March 24, 2016. The historical financial information presented prior to March 24,
2016 is that of Ecoark. 

Further, the Articles of Incorporation were
amended to increase the authorized shares of common stock to 100,000 shares, to effect the creation of 5,000 shares of  blank
check  preferred stock, and to approve a reverse stock split of the MSC common stock of 1 for 250. 

After the Merger, the Company had 29,057 shares
of common stock issued and outstanding. MSC s shareholders and holders of debt, notes, warrants and options received an aggregate
of 1,351 shares of the Company s common stock and Ecoark s shareholders received an aggregate of 27,706 shares of the
Company s common stock.

Stock Options    

On February 16, 2013, the Board of Directors
of Ecoark approved the EcoArk Inc. 2013 Stock Option Plan (the  Plan ). The purposes of the Plan are to attract and
retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to employees,
directors and consultants, and to promote the success of the Company s business. The Plan is expected to contribute to the
attainment of these objectives by offering employees, directors and consultants the opportunity to acquire stock ownership interests
in the Company, and other rights with respect to stock of the Company, and to thereby provide them with incentives to put forth
maximum efforts for the success of the Company. 

Awards under this Plan were only granted in
the form of nonstatutory stock options (  Options  ) to purchase the Company's Series C Stock prior to the merger
with MSC. Under the terms of the Plan, at the time of the merger the Options convert into the right to purchase an equal number
of shares of the Company. 

In May 2014, Ecoark had granted Options to purchase 693 shares to various employees and consultants of Ecoark.
The Options had an exercise price of $1.25 per share and have a term of 10 years. The Options vest over a three-year period as
follows: 25% immediately; 25% on the first anniversary date; 25% on the second anniversary date; and 25% on the third anniversary
date. During 2015 Ecoark issued additional Options on 625 shares of common stock. Therefore, at the end of 2015, Options under
the Ecoark plan were outstanding to purchase 1,318 shares of common stock. The total original number of Options on 1,318 Ecoark
shares was divided by two in conjunction with changes required by the Merger Agreement and converted to Options to purchase 659
shares of the Company with an adjusted exercise price of $2.50. The Board authorized the conversion of these Options into Restricted
Stock Grants, but later determined that the Options could remain outstanding and exercisable. In September the remaining vesting
was accelerated to have those Options 100% vested, and thus, at September 30, 2016, Options on 659 shares of the Company are outstanding
with an adjusted exercise price of $2.50 under the Plan. 

Management valued the Options utilizing the
Black-Scholes Method, with the following criteria: stock price - $2.50; exercise price - $2.50; expected term   10 years;
discount rate   0.25%; and volatility   100%. 

The Company records stock based compensation
in accordance with ASC 718, and has recorded stock based compensation of $904 and $316 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The 2013 Incentive Stock Plan (the  2013
Plan ) of Ecoark Holdings (previously MSC) was registered on February 7, 2013. Under the 2013 Plan, the Company may grant
incentive stock of up to 5,500 shares of common stock to Company employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors. The
type of grant, vesting provisions, exercise price and expiration dates will be established by the Board at the date of grant. At
the time of the merger, 5,497 shares were available to issue under the 2013 Plan. As of September 30, 2016, the Board has authorized
blocks of incentive stock totaling 5,225 shares to be issued to various employees of the Company and delegated the authority to
determine numbers and terms of the awards to the management of the Company. None of these awards have yet been distributed to employees
and therefore no cost for this incentive stock award is yet recorded. After these awards are completed, 272 shares will remain
in the 2013 Plan for future incentive awards. 

The 2,450 Options of MSC outstanding at the
time of the merger were converted into shares of common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement with Ecoark. 

Warrants    

MSC had issued warrants for 3,785 shares
that were converted into shares of common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement with Ecoark. Cashless warrants were exercised
for 2 shares in the second quarter. 

The Company issued warrants for
4,337 shares as part of the private placement that was completed on April 28, 2016. Warrants for 85 shares were exercised in September,
leaving warrants for 4,252 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2016. These warrants have a strike price of $5.00 per share and
expire on December 31, 2018. 

Additional warrants were committed to
in October. See Note 15.

NOTE 10: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

Operating Leases    

The Company leases many of its operating and office facilities for various terms under long-term, non-cancelable
operating lease agreements. These leases expire at various dates through 2021. Rent expense was approximately $444 and $251 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Future minimum lease payments required under the operating leases are as follows:
2016 - $196, 2017 - $791, 2018 - $748, 2019 - $606, 2020 - $300 and 2021 - $25.  

Contract Related Fees    

Prior to the Merger, a subsidiary of the Company, as part of a contract to develop its products, has agreed
to pay the contractor 1.5% of future New York state manufactured sales, and 5% of future non-New York state manufactured sales
until the entire funds paid by a contractor have been repaid (or three times the funds if non-New York manufactured), or 15 years
after start of sales. As of September 30, 2016, the subsidiary has $1,252 of contract related expenses. These funds will be owed
to the contractor, as described above, contingent upon the sale of the subsidiary s product related to that contract.

NOTE 11: INCOME TAXES  

The provision (benefit) for income taxes for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 differs from the amount which would be expected as a result of applying the statutory
tax rates to the losses before income taxes due primarily to the valuation allowance to fully reserve net deferred tax assets. 

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to
be available to reduce taxable income. As the achievement of required future taxable income is uncertain, the Company recorded
a valuation allowance. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a
net operating loss carry forward of $47,460 expiring through  2036 . The Company has
provided a valuation allowance against the full amount of the deferred tax asset due to Management s uncertainty about its
realization. Furthermore, the net operating loss carry forward may be subject to further limitation pursuant to Section 382 of
the Internal Revenue Code. The valuation allowance was increased by $3,886 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Labs, the market for cloud-based, real-time supply chain analytic solutions is rapidly evolving with new competitors with competing
technologies, including companies that have greater resources than Ecoark Holdings. Some of these companies have brand recognition,
established relationships with retailers, and own the manufacturing process. There are currently hundreds of sustainability programs
available in the market. These programs are offered through retailers, manufacturers, and service providers. Ecoark Holdings believes
that, analyzing the competitive factors affecting the market for its solutions, its products compete favorably by offering an integrated
supply chain solution compared with other companies offering real-time supply chain analytic solutions. 

Intellectual Property  

Ecoark Holdings
and its subsidiaries have had 70 patents issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and about 21 additional patent

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30,
2016 and 2015  

Revenues   

Revenues for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 were $5,239 as compared to $1,687 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The 311% increase was
principally due to the acquisition of Sable in May 2016. Revenue from products of $3,860 in 2016 increased 326% from $1,185 in
2015. Excluding the revenue from Sable, product revenues increased 20% due to higher shipments of recycled plastic trash cans by
Pioneer Products. Revenue from services of $1,379 in 2016 increased 275% from $502 achieved in 2015. Expansion of the 3D mapping,
modeling and consulting business along with certain commission income drove the increase in service revenues. 

Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit   

Cost of revenues for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $4,355 as compared to $1,391 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, a 313% increase. The
increase was directly related to the acquisition of Sable. Excluding the cost of revenues of Sable, product cost of revenues increased
24% due to higher sales of trash cans. The 299% increase in gross profit from $296 in 2015 to $884 in 2016 was principally a result
of higher margins on service revenues as Eco3D expanded its business. Services achieved a gross margin of 51% in 2015 and 61% in
2016. Total gross margin for the Company was 17% in both 2016 and 2015.  

Operating Expenses   

The Pioneer Products
operational activities described above required relatively limited home office support. Therefore, most of the operating expenses
below were allocated to the services segment. The services segment includes activities relating to Zest Labs in which the Company
has invested considerable resources for support and funding. 

Salaries and Salary Related Costs  

Salaries for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 were $2,061, an increase of 268% from $768 in 2015. The increase was related to a number of individuals
who became employees compared with previous contractor status and the expansion of staff at each operation. In addition, $565 of
stock-based compensation was recorded in September 2016 when the vesting of the remaining options was accelerated. 

Professional Fees and Consulting  

Professional fees and consulting
expenses for 2016 of $1,676 increased from $351 incurred in 2015 principally as a result of costs associated with the Company s
pilot of the ZEST Data Services platform. Additional consulting costs were incurred related to the next round of capital raising
and efforts related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. 

General and Administrative  

Other general and administrative
expenses in 2016 were $936, an increase of 244% from $383 in 2015, primarily as a result of increased rent for expanded facilities
and office support and operating costs associated with business growth. 

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization
expense for 2016 was $173, compared to $400 for 2015. The 57% decrease resulted from certain customer list intangible assets becoming
fully amortized in September 2015, offset by depreciation and amortization of Sable assets. 

Research and Development  

Research and development
expenses were $2,435 in 2016 compared to $764 in 2015. The majority of these expenses related to the ZEST initiatives at Zest Labs.
The Company incurred $998 of costs in 2016 related to a third party that assisted in a significant pilot of the ZEST Data Services
platform. These costs were in addition to expanded internal costs relating to ZEST. 

Interest Expense   

Interest expense, net of
interest income, for 2016 was $92 as compared to $185 for 2015. The 50% decrease was a result of lower interest accruing on the
related party debt in 2016 because of a decrease in interest rates and lower outstanding balances as well as an increase in interest
income resulting from investments from proceeds of the private offering and an increase in interest expense on debt assumed in
the Sable acquisition. 

Net Loss   

Net loss for 2016 was $6,566
as compared to $2,521 in 2015. The $4,045 increase in net loss was primarily due to increased research and development costs for
ZEST, higher consulting and salaries costs, offset by lower amortization and interest expense. 

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30,
2016 and 2015  

Revenues   

Revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were $10,778 as compared to $6,184 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The 174% increase was
principally due to the acquisition of Sable in May 2016. Revenue from products of $7,429 in 2016 increased 177% from $4,194 in
2015. Excluding the revenue from Sable, product revenues decreased 3% due to slightly lower shipments of recycled plastic trash
cans by Pioneer Products, offset by sales of a new product, office chairs. Revenue from services of $3,349 in 2016 increased 68%
from $1,990 achieved in 2015. Expansion of the 3D mapping, modeling and consulting business along with certain commission income
drove the increase in service revenues. 

Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit   

Cost of revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $8,660 as compared to $4,721 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
increase was directly related to the acquisition of Sable in May 2016. Excluding the cost of revenues of Sable, product cost of
revenues decreased 1% due to slightly lower revenues. The increase in gross profit from $1,463 in 2015 to $2,118 in 2016 was principally
a result of the increase in higher margin services business revenues as Eco3D expanded. Services achieved a gross margin of 68%
in 2015 and 63% in 2016, with the decrease partly due to the mix of new projects. Total gross margin for the Company was 20% in
2016 and 24% in 2015. Margins for products decreased from 4% in 2015 to break even in 2016 due to Sable s results and costs
incurred for the introduction of the new products. 

Operating Expenses   

The Pioneer Products
operational activities described above required relatively limited home office support, and significant support was provided to
Sable. However, most of the operating expenses below were allocated to the services segment. The services segment includes activities
relating to Zest Labs for which the Company has invested considerable resources for support and funding. 

Salaries and Salary Related Costs  

Salaries for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were $4,718, up 212% from $2,224 in 2015. The increase was related to a number of individuals who became
employees compared with previous contractor status and the expansion of staff at each operation, along with $904 of stock-based
compensation. 

Professional Fees and Consulting  

Professional fees
and consulting expenses for 2016 of $5,259 increased from $1,396 incurred in 2015 as a result of a number of costs incurred associated
with the Company becoming a public entity in 2016 principally investment banking fees and legal fees related to the Merger offset
by a number of individuals who became employees compared with previous contractor status. A majority of the fees, $2,500, was in
non-cash form and paid by the issuance of Common Stock. Consulting expenses related to the ZEST pilot, system implementation efforts
and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance also contributed to the increase. 

General and Administrative  

Other general and administrative
expenses in 2016 were $1,929 increased from $1,308 in 2015, primarily as a result of increased office support and operating costs
associated with business growth. 

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization
expense for 2016 was $497 (including depreciation of $119 relating to Sable production equipment that is included in cost of product
sales as opposed to operating expenses), compared to $1,234 for 2015. The 60% decrease resulted from certain customer list intangibles
becoming fully amortized in September 2015. 

Research and Development  

Research and development
expenses increased 165% from $2,502 in 2015 to $4,130 in 2016. The majority of these expenses related to the ZEST initiatives at
Zest Labs. The Company made significant progress in developing and testing the ZEST Data Services platform in 2016 and has had
an additional 7 patents issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 2016 resulting from its research and development
initiatives. 

Interest Expense   

Interest expense, net of
interest income, for 2016 was $286 as compared to $585 for 2015. The 51% decrease was a result of lower interest accruing on the
related party debt in 2016 because of a decrease in interest rates and lower outstanding balances as well as an increase in interest
income resulting from investments from proceeds of the private offering offset by an increase in interest expense on debt assumed
in the Sable acquisition. 

Net Loss   

Net loss for 2016 was $14,726
as compared to $7,846 in 2015. The $6,880 increase in net loss was primarily due to a number of costs incurred associated with
the Company becoming a public entity in 2016, principally investment banking fees and legal fees related to the Merger in 2016
and significant increases in all operating expenses, partially offset by the decrease in amortization expense and the increase
in gross profit. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity is the ability
of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on
an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable
and accounts payable and capital expenditures. 

To date we have financed
our operations through sales of common stock and the issuance of debt. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had cash of $4,871 and $1,962, respectively and investments
of $3,509 at September 30, 2016. Working capital improved from a deficit of $2,153 at December 31, 2015 to a working capital surplus
of $3,351 at September 30, 2016. The increase in working capital was principally due to the $17,320 raised, net of expenses, in
the successful private offering that was completed in April 2016. The Company remains dependent upon raising capital from future
financing transactions. Up to $2,000 of short-term investments are pledged as collateral for notes payable. 

Net cash used by operating
activities was $9,680 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $5,952
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used in operating activities is related to the Company s net loss partially
offset by non-cash expenses. 

Net cash provided by financing
activities in 2016 was $17,320, including $18,000 from the issuance of common stock and warrants, principally related to the private
offering less net repayments of debt of $680. In 2015, $31 was received from the issuance of common stock and $5,172 was received
from the re-issuance of treasury shares, offset by $782 net payments of debt. 

Since our inception, the
Company has experienced negative cash flow from operations and expects to experience significant negative cash flow from operations
in the future. It will need to raise additional funds in the future so that it can expand its operations and repay its indebtedness.
The inability to obtain additional capital may restrict its ability to grow and may reduce its ability to continue to conduct business
operations. 

At September 30, 2016 maturities
of the Company s note payable, debt-related parties and long-term debt due within one year of $5,565 were included in current
liabilities. The Company assumed debt of $1,931 in the acquisition of Sable and made $1,068 in debt payments during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the net of which increased the balance to $5,754 at September 30, 2016. The decision by B B Merritt
to convert the $3,000 note payable into common stock will provide a significant boost to liquidity. 

The Company sold 4,337 shares to 214 accredited investors through the private offering in March and April
which raised $17,320, net of expenses. In September 2016 the Company received proceeds of $425 from the exercise of warrants. The
proceeds are being used for working capital purposes, including substantial investments in the ZEST initiatives.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

In preparing our financial
statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on revenue, income (loss) from operations
and net income (loss), as well as the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. The application of our critical
accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us. Our management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates
on a regular basis and make changes accordingly. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these
estimates. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If actual results
were to materially differ from these estimates, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 

Our critical accounting polices include the following: 

Principles of Consolidation   

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Ecoark Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the Company.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Ecoark Holdings is a holding company
and holds one hundred percent of Ecoark, Pioneer Products (which owns 100% of Sable), Zest Labs, Magnolia Solar and Eco3D (Ecoark
owned 65% of Eco3D and the remaining 35% interest was owned by executives of Eco3D until September 2016 when the executives 
35% interest was acquired in exchange for 525 shares of Ecoark Holdings stock, directly or indirectly. 

The Company applies the
guidance of Topic 810  Consolidation  of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards
Codification ( ASC ) to determine whether and how to consolidate another entity. Pursuant to ASC 810-10-15-10 all majority-owned
subsidiaries all entities in which a parent has a controlling financial interest shall be consolidated except when
control does not rest with the parent. Pursuant to ASC 810-10-15-8, the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is
ownership of a majority voting interest, and, therefore, as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity, directly or indirectly,
of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation. The power
to control may also exist with a lesser percentage of ownership, for example, by contract, lease, agreement with other stockholders,
or by court decree. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires Management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
These estimates include, but are not limited to, management s estimate of provisions required for non-collectible accounts
receivable, obsolete or slow-moving inventory, and determination of the fair value of stock awards issued. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. 

Inventory   

Inventory is stated at the
lower of cost or market. Inventory cost is determined by specific identification on a first in first out basis, and provisions
are made to reduce slow-moving, obsolete, or unusable inventories to their estimated useful or scrap values. The Company establishes
reserves for this purpose. 

Property and Equipment and Long-Lived
Assets   

Property and equipment is
stated at cost. Depreciation on property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets, which range from three to ten years for all classes of property and equipment, except leasehold improvements which
are depreciated over the shorter of 10 years or the term of the lease. 

FASB Codification Topic
360  Property, Plant and Equipment  ( ASC 360 ), requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The application of ASC 360 has not materially affected the Company s
reported earnings, financial condition or cash flows. 

Intangible assets with definite useful lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible
assets represent the valuation of the company-owned patents and customer lists. These intangible assets are being amortized on
a straight-line basis over their estimated average useful lives of thirteen and a half years for the patents and three years for
the customer lists. Expenditures on intangible assets through Ecoark Holding s filing of patent and trademark protection
for company-owned inventions are expensed as incurred.  

Ecoark assesses the impairment
of identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Factors the company considers to be important which could trigger an impairment review include the following: 

1. Significant underperformance relative to expected
historical or projected future operating results; 

2. Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired
assets or the strategy for the overall business; and 

3. Significant negative industry or economic
trends. 

When the Company determines
that the carrying value of intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of
impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows, the Company records
an impairment charge. The Company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate
determined by Management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model. Significant management judgment
is required in determining whether an indicator of impairment exists and in projecting cash flows. 

Revenue Recognition   

Product revenue primarily
consists of the sale of recycled plastics products, electronic hardware and furniture. Revenue is recognized when the following
criteria have been met: 

Evidence of an arrangement exists. 
The Company considers a customer purchase order, service agreement, contract, or equivalent document to be evidence of an arrangement. 

Delivery has occurred.  The
Company s standard transfer terms are free on board ( FOB ) shipping point. Thus, delivery is considered to have
occurred when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the time of shipment. 

The fee is fixed or determinable. 
The Company considers the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and payment terms are
standard, which is generally 30-60 days. 

Collection is deemed reasonably
assured . Collection is deemed reasonably assured if it is expected that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the
arrangement as payments become due. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, then revenue is deferred and
recognized upon cash collection. 

The Company will recognize
revenues for its software in accordance with ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition. 

Revenue from software license
agreements is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery of the software has occurred, the fee is fixed
or determinable, and collectability is probable. In software arrangements that include more than one element, the Company allocates
the total arrangement fee among the elements based on the relative fair value of each of the elements. 

License revenue allocated
to software products generally is recognized upon delivery of the products or deferred and recognized in future periods to the
extent that an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and for which fair values have not been
established. Revenue allocated to maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance term and revenue allocated
to training and other service elements is recognized as the services are performed. If evidence of fair value does not exist for
all elements of a license agreement and post customer support ( PCS ) is the only undelivered element, then all revenue
for the license arrangement is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement as license revenue. If evidence of fair value
of all undelivered PCS elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized
using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining
portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. 

Cost of license revenue
primarily includes product, delivery, and royalty costs. Cost of maintenance and service revenue consists primarily of labor costs
for engineers performing implementation services, technical support, and training personnel as well as facilities and equipment
costs. 

The
Company enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are
delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ),
revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and
revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. The Company uses a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating
revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE ), (ii) third-party evidence, and
(iii) best estimate of selling price ( ESP ). For software elements, the Company follows the industry specific software
guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable
is sold separately or the price established by Management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will
not change before introduction into the marketplace. 

ESPs
are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone
basis. The process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon
the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. 

When the arrangement with
a customer includes services or significant production, modification, or customization of software, we recognize the related revenue
using the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with the accounting guidance and certain production-type contracts contained
in ASC 605-35, Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. We use the percentage of completion method provided all of the
following conditions exist: 

the contract includes provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding goods or services to be provided and received by the parties, the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement;   

the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract;   

the Company can be expected to perform its contractual obligations; and   

reliable estimates of progress towards completion can be made.   

We measure completion based
on achieving milestones detailed in the agreements with the customers. Costs of providing services, including services accounted
for in accordance with ASC 605-35, are expensed as incurred. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

The Company follows ASC
718-10   Share Based Payments  . The Company calculates compensation expense for all awards granted, but not yet
vested, based on the grant-date fair values. Stock-based compensation expense for all awards granted is based on the grant-date
fair values. The Company recognizes these compensation costs, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, on a pro rata basis over the
requisite service period of each vesting tranche of each award. The Company considers voluntary termination behavior as well as
trends of actual option forfeitures when estimating the forfeiture rate. 

The Company measures compensation
expense for its non-employee stock-based compensation under ASC 505-50,   Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued
to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services  . The fair value of the option
issued is used to measure the transaction, as this is more reliable than the fair value of the services received. The fair value
is measured at the value of the Company s common stock on the date that the commitment for performance by the counterparty
has been reached or the counterparty s performance is complete. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly
to expense and additional paid-in capital.  

Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets   

The Company reviews recoverability
of long-lived assets on a periodic basis whenever events and changes in circumstances have occurred which may indicate a possible
impairment. The assessment for potential impairment is based primarily on the Company s ability to recover the carrying value
of its long-lived assets from expected future cash flows from its operations on an undiscounted basis. If such assets are determined
to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the
assets. Fixed assets to be disposed of by sale will be carried at the lower of the then current carrying value or fair value less
estimated costs to sell. 

Fair Value Measurements   

ASC 820,   Fair
Value Measurements   defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. ASC 820 classifies these inputs into the following hierarchy: 

Level 1 inputs: Quoted prices
for identical instruments in active markets. 

Level 2 inputs: Quoted prices
for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and
model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 

Level 3 inputs: Instruments
with primarily unobservable value drivers. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

As required by Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2016, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company s current management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), who concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective. 

Disclosure controls and
procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting
Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting   

There were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, except as follows. The Company expanded
its implementation of its cloud-based accounting and ERP system from NetSuite and added to the professional accounting staff. The
Company believes that these additions have improved and will continue to improve internal controls over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures   

In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure
controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

In the ordinary course of
business, the Company may become a party to various legal proceedings generally involving contractual matters, infringement actions,
product liability claims and other matters. The Company is not a party to any lawsuit or administrative proceeding as of the date
hereof. Its management is not aware of any lawsuits or administrative proceedings that are threatened or anticipated, and we are
not considering the institution or prosecution of any legal proceeding as of the date hereof.
