Note
1   Organization, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

International
Western Petroleum, Inc. ( IWP  or the  Company ) was incorporated on February 19, 2014 as a Nevada corporation.
The Company was formed to conduct operations in the oil and gas industry.  

The accompanying unaudited interim financial
statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended
February 29, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a
fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected
herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
year. Notes to the unaudited interim financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the
audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year as reported in the Form 10-K have been omitted. 

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense
during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
carrying amount of the Company s accounts payable and accrued expenses and advances from officer approximates its estimated
fair value due to the short-term nature of that financial instrument.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of six months or less to be cash equivalents.
The Company had $305,562 and $542,228 of cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, respectively.  

Concentrations
of Credit Risk   

Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash deposits placed with financial
institutions. The Company maintains its cash in bank accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits as guaranteed
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At August 31, 2016, $55,562 of the Company s cash balances was uninsured.
The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts.  

Accounts
Receivable   

Accounts
receivable typically consist of oil and gas receivables. The Company has classified these as short-term assets in the balance
sheet because the Company expects repayment or recovery within the next 12 months. The Company evaluates these accounts receivable
for collectability considering the results of operations of these related entities and when necessary records allowances for expected
unrecoverable amounts. To date, no allowances have been recorded.  

Oil
and Gas Properties   

The
Company follows the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and gas properties, whereby all costs incurred in
connection with the acquisition, exploration for and development of petroleum and natural gas reserves, including unproductive
wells, are capitalized. Such costs include lease acquisition, geological and geophysical activities, rentals on non-producing
leases, drilling, completing and equipping of oil and gas wells and administrative costs directly attributable to those activities,
and asset retirement costs. General and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred.  

Disposition
of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustment
would significantly alter the relationship between capital costs and proved reserves of oil, in which case the gain or loss is
recognized in the statement of operations.  

Future
development, site restoration, dismantlement and abandonment costs, are estimated property by property, based upon current economic
conditions and regulatory requirements, and are included in amortization of our oil and natural gas property costs.  

Depletion
of capitalized oil properties and estimated future development costs, excluding unproved properties, are based on the unit-of-production
method based on proved reserves.  

At
the end of each quarter, the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties, net of related deferred income taxes, is limited
to the sum of the estimated future after-tax net revenues from proved properties, after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions,
discounted at 10%, and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties, adjusted for related income tax effects. This limitation
is known as the  ceiling test,  and is based on SEC rules for the full cost oil and gas accounting method. There was
no ceiling test write-down recorded during the three and six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.  

The
Company assesses the carrying value of its unproved properties for impairment periodically. If the results of an assessment indicate
that an unproved property is impaired (which was assessed in connection with the Company s evaluation of goodwill impairment),
then the carrying value of the unproved properties is added to the proved oil property costs to be amortized and subject to the
ceiling test.  

Fixed
asset   

Fixed
asset is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the five-year estimated useful life of the asset.  

Asset
Retirement Obligations   

If a reasonable estimate of the fair value
of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells can be made, the Company will record
a liability (an asset retirement obligation or  ARO ) on its balance sheet and capitalize the present value of the
asset retirement cost in oil and gas properties in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred. In general, the
amount of an ARO and the costs capitalized will be equal to the estimated future cost to satisfy the abandonment obligation assuming
the normal operation of the asset, using current prices that are escalated by an assumed inflation factor up to the estimated
settlement date, which is then discounted back to the date that the abandonment obligation was incurred using an assumed cost
of funds for the Company. After recording these amounts, the ARO will be accreted to its future estimated value using the same
assumed cost of funds and the capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis over the estimated proved developed
reserves. Both the accretion and the depreciation will be included in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense on our
statements of operations. 

Revenue
Recognition   

All
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service or sale is complete, the price is fixed or
determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is derived from the sale of crude oil and natural gas. Revenue
from crude oil and natural gas sales is recognized when the product is delivered to the purchaser and collectability is reasonably
assured. The Company follows the  sales method  of accounting for oil and natural gas revenue, so it recognizes revenue
on all natural gas or crude oil sold to purchasers, regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to its ownership in the
property. A receivable or liability is recognized only to the extent that the Company has an imbalance on a specific property
greater than its share of the expected remaining proved reserves. If collection is uncertain, revenue is recognized when cash
is collected.  

Income
Taxes   

Income
taxes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic No. 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense,
over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award.  

Basic
and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Common Share   

Basic
net loss per common share amounts are computed by dividing the net loss available to International Western Petroleum Inc., shareholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding over the reporting period. In periods in which the Company reports
a net loss, dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive.
For the six months ended August 31, 2016, there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding.  

Reclassifications   

Certain
reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. All reclassifications
have been applied consistently to the periods presented.  

Subsequent
Events   

The
Company evaluated all transactions from August 31, 2016 through the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event disclosure
consideration.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its results
of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

Note
2   Going Concern   

As
reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has generated net loss of $570,167 and cash flows used from operations
of $387,147 during the six months ended August 31, 2016. Revenue is mainly generated from oil and gas sales from the Company s
oil and gas properties.  

Management
has a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. The Company will be required to raise additional funds to fully execute its business plan, however, the Company believes
it has sufficient cash on hand and limited near term obligations to sustain its current operations for the next twelve months.  

Note

and $5,569, respectively. The Company recorded no impairment of its oil and gas properties during the three and six months ended
August 31, 2016 and 2015.

Overview   

International Western Petroleum, Inc., a
Nevada corporation, ( IWP,   we,   our,   us  or the  Company )
was incorporated on February 19, 2014 and is based in Irving, Texas. The Company was formed to conduct operations in the oil and
gas industry. We are an oil and natural gas company that focuses on the acquisition, development, and exploration of crude oil
and natural gas properties in Texas. On May 4, 2015, the Company acquired significant working interests from the Bend Arch Lion
1A Joint Venture and the Bend Arch Lion 1B Joint Venture encompassing a total production of seven (7) producing oil and gas wells
on a total 380 acres out of 777 acres of the Bend Arch Lion project showing proven recoverable reserves of approximately 429.48
Mbbl and 353.78 MMcf. To date, the Company, together with its affiliated operator, International Western Oil Corporation ( IWO ),
have completed drilling an additional three (3) oil and gas wells, thus totaling ten (10) gross wells in production. It is noted
that the Bend Arch Lion 1A and 1B Joint Ventures are parts of the total 777-acre leaseholds that have not been fully explored.
Currently, IWO holds approximately 2,400 acres in leaseholds in the Central West Texas region. The Company plans to acquire additional
leaseholds from IWO in the future. 

The
Company is continually seeking strategic investors to help it develop additional exploration projects located within the Bend
Arch-Fort Worth Basin as well as other prime acquisition targets in the Central West, South and East Texas. As such, the Company
is working on obtaining enough funding to provide a budget for new acquisitions in the remaining calendar year of 2017 as well
as new exploration projects in 2017 to meet its financial objectives during the fiscal year ending February 28, 2017.  

Strategy
and Implementation Summary   

Sales
Strategy   

Abilene,
Texas is the closest city with oil handling and sales firms. Our sales strategy in relation to spot pricing will be to produce
less when the sales price is lower and produce more when the sales price is higher. To maintain the lowest production cost, we
will aim to have our inventory in tanks be virtually zero. Members of the Ramsey family that are related to our CEO have business
relationships with BML Crude Oil Marketing, Inc. (BML) and West Texas Gas (WTG Jameson). The Company has started producing
oil and natural gas, while leveraging Tier 1 business relationship and having entered into material agreements with BML so that,
as our Tier 1 buyers, BML can handle pick-up and sales of our crude oil stock to refineries and WTG Jameson can collect natural
gas from our gas lines connecting to WTG pipelines.  

As such, crude
oil will be picked up from the leases and natural gas can be collected as needed during the calendar month. At the end of the
month, the hydrocarbon total sales will be tallied by lease and the 30-day average of the daily closing of oil and gas will be
tabulated. On or about the 25th of the following month, the proceeds from oil and gas sales will be issued to the financial parties
of record.  

Plan
of Operations   

During
fiscal year 2017, the Company is actively looking for large-reserve oil and gas concessions and existing production to acquire
and continue to raise enough capital via equity and/or debt financing options to meet its operational goal in fiscal year 2017.  

Based on management s general
management and petroleum exploration experience and its geology expertise, the Company believes in its ability to identify
high potential acreages and high production fields. 

Since the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016,
the Company has reviewed several good acquisition candidates in the West, Permian Basin and South Texas. After identifying a new
prospect, additional research and evaluation was carried out using personal contacts, geologists, seismic, satellite hydrocarbon
imaging, production data and every available resource to obtain information and data in order to make an acquisition decision.
Our operational plan after each acquisition is to increase production of the acquired oil and gas properties using state-of-the-art
production technologies using a designated budget pre-approved by the Company s senior management team. 

The Company has plans to design a cost effective
operating budget for each exploration project associated with an acquisition project and each budget will vary depending on the
total depth of drilling and whether it is a new drilling or a re-entry. For each project, the Company plans on hiring selected
operators to work under the close supervision of a core team of geologists, engineers and scientists. 

The
Company also has an immediate operational plan to apply selective leading edge Enhanced Oil Recovery ( EOR ) technologies
from technology vendors to improve existing production after each future acquisition.  

On
May 4, 2015, the Company acquired a 39.5% working interest from International Western Oil Corporation ( IWO ) in the
Bend Arch Lion 1A Joint Venture (the Pittard Bend Arch White property encompassing 160 acres   State ID# 21488) (the  1A
Venture ) and a 50% working interest in the Bend Arch Lion 1B Joint Venture (the Pittard Bend Arch Red property encompassing
220 acres - State ID# 13121) (the  1B Venture ). By acquiring these working interests, the Company will directly receive
the share of working interest revenue (after accounting for applicable taxes, expenses, and landowner royalties) IWO was receiving
prior to the acquisitions.  

On July 29, 2016, the Company, acting as
a managing venturer of the Marshall Walden Joint Venture, executed an  Assignment, Conveyance and Bill of Sale  with
Cerberus Production, LLC of the two (2) oil producing properties in Kilgore city of East Texas, the Fannie Marshall Lease (RRC
Lease No. 07413) and the Ida Walden Lease (RRC Lease No. 07419). The Company owns ten percent (10%) of the working interest of
the Marshall Walden Joint Venture which was formed by the Company and its acquisition partner, Odyssey Enterprises, LLC. The Marshall
Walden Joint Venture was formed for the purpose of acquiring the two (2) above-mentioned leases. 

The Company is currently examining a proven
state-of-the-art Organic Oil Recovery (OOR) technology proposed by an Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) technology company which has
proposed a partnership with the Company in order to identify suitable mature oil fields and apply this OOR technology aiming to
significantly increase the current production from mature oil and gas fields. The Company believes that this technology is
one of the most important oil recovery breakthroughs in decades. This technology, based on natural ecology of the oil reservoir,
has shown high-performance records on 4 continents, onshore and offshore, with over 300 applications in over 40 oil fields, resulting
with an average increase of 92% in oil production to date. The technology is believed to be pure organic and biodegradable with
fast result and cost effectiveness, bringing major economic benefits to many oil and gas producers in low oil price environment
today. 

As
65% of oil in the world are being trapped underground today leading to a major opportunity for the Company to gain significant
growth in revenues, the Company plans to apply this technology on its newly acquired leases in Kilgore city, East Texas and also
aims to obtain an exclusivity from this technology partner in certain region of Texas while pursuing certain revenue-sharing model
with this technology partner.  

Production
Improvement Program   

The
Bend Arch Lion 1A JV is a 160-acre leasehold having 4 producing wells which have been drilled by our Texas-based operating partner
International Western Oil. The Company plans to apply a suitable EOR technology after further review in in order to increase its
production. Based on our recent studies, there are the necessary inclusionary and sedimentary formations for hydrocarbon generation
and deposits and geology studies have concluded that there are significant hydrocarbon reserves present on this property. With
additional geology studies, we have also identified additional drilling locations on this concession.  

The
Bend Arch Lion 1B JV is a 220-acre leasehold having 6 new producing wells which have been drilled by our Texas-based operating
partner International Western Oil. The Company plans to apply a suitable EOR technology on the Ellenburger formation to significantly
increase its production in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Based on our recent studies, there are the necessary inclusionary
and sedimentary formations for hydrocarbon generation and deposits and geology studies have concluded that there are significant
hydrocarbon reserves present on this property. With additional geology studies, we have also identified additional drilling locations
on this concession.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

We
do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

(a)      Disclosure
                                         of Controls and Procedures     

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports,
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based
in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in
a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.  

Pursuant
to SEC Rule 13a-15(b), the Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that
evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that due to the material
weakness discussed below, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, as of the end of the month
ended August 31, 2015, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control our financial reporting
as of November 30, 2015, the Company determined that the following items constituted material weaknesses:  

The
                                         Company does not have policies and procedures in place to ensure the timely review, disclosure
                                         and accurate financial reporting for significant agreements and transactions.    

The
                                         Company does not have an independent audit committee in place, which would provide oversight
                                         of the Company s officers, operations and financial reporting function.    

(b)      Changes
                                         in Internal Controls      

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

of common stock to a consultant in exchange for services rendered. 

The
above shares were issued in reliance on the exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. These shares of our common stock
qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) since the issuance shares by us did not involve a public offering. The offering was
not a  public offering  as defined in Section 4(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal,
manner of the issuance and number of shares issued. We did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of shares
to a high number of investors. In addition, the investors had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since
they agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of
the Act. This restriction ensures that these shares would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be
part of a  public offering.  Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements to qualify for
exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for this transaction.
