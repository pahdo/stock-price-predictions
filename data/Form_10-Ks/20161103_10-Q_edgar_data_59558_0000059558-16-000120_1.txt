1  .  Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation 

Nature of Operations    

Lincoln National Corporation and its   majority-owned   subsidiaries ( LNC  or the  Company,  which also may be referred to as  we,   our  or  us ) operate multiple insurance businesses through four business segments.  See Note   13   for additional details.  The collective group of businesses uses  Lincoln Financial Group  as its marketing identity.  Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions.  These products include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance ( UL ), variable universal life insurance ( VUL ), linked-benefit   UL  ,    indexed universal life insurance ( IUL ),   term life insurance, employer-sponsored retirement plans and services, and group life, disability and dental. 

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with   United States of America generally accepted accounting principles   ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions for the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  Therefore, the information contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (   2015   Form 10-K ), should be read in connection with the reading of these interim unaudited consolidated financial statements. 

Certain GAAP policies, which significantly affect the determination of financial position, results of operations and cash flows, are summarized in our   2015   Form 10-K. 

In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s results.  Operating results for the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 3  1,   2016  .  All material inter  -  company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

2.  New Accounting Standards 

Adoption of New Accounting Standards 

The following table provides a description of our adoption of new Accounting Standard Updates ( ASUs ) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) and the impact of the adoption on our financial statements: 

Standard  

Description  

Date of Adoption  

Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters  

ASU 2014-16, Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin to Debt or to Equity  

This standard clarifies that when considering the nature of the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share; an entity must consider all of the stated and implied substantive terms of the hybrid instrument, including the embedded derivative feature that is being considered for separate accounting from the host contract.    

January 1, 2016  

The adoption of this ASU did not have an effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.    

ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  

This standard addresses consolidation accounting guidance related to limited partnerships, limited liability companies and securitization structures.  The new standard includes changes to existing consolidation models that eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, clarifies when fees paid to a decision maker should be a factor in the variable interest entities ( VIEs ) consolidation evaluation and reduces the VIE consolidation models from two to one by eliminating the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds.    

January 1, 2016  

The adoption of this ASU did not have an effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  We have provided additional financial statement disclosures related to our limited partnerships in Note 3.     

ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs            

Debt issuance costs were previously recognized as a deferred charge in the balance sheet.  This amendment requires the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt.  This standard does not change the recognition and measurement requirements related to debt issuance costs.  Retrospective application of the amendments in this ASU is required.    

January 1, 2016  

We have retrospectively reclassified approximately $29 million of our debt issuance costs from other assets to long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015.  See ASU 2015-15 for debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements.   

ASU 2015-05,    Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement               

This standard clarifies the accounting requirements for recognizing cloud computing arrangements.  Software licenses purchased through cloud computing arrangements should be accounted for in a manner consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract.  

January 1, 2016  

The adoption of this ASU did not have an effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.    

ASU 2015-07, Disclosures for Certain Investments That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent)  

This standard removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient.  In addition, the standard removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient, and limits those disclosures only to those investments for which the practical expedient has been elected.    

January 1, 2016  

The adoption of this ASU did not result in a change to our financial statement disclosures.

Standard  

Description  

Date of Adoption  

Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters  

ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  

Given the absence of authoritative accounting guidance in ASU 2015-03 related to debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements, this standard clarifies that the SEC Staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting these debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement.  

January 1, 2016  

The adoption of this ASU did not have an effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  

Future   Adoption of New Accounting   Standards 

The following table provides a description of future adoptions of new accounting standards that may have an impact on our financial statements when adopted:  

Standard  

Description  

Projected Date of Adoption  

Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters  

ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers; Deferral of the Effective Date  

This standard establishes the core principle of recognizing revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services.  The amendments define a five-step process that systematically identifies the various components of the revenue recognition process, culminating with the recognition of revenue upon satisfaction of an entity s performance obligation.  Retrospective application is required.  After performing extensive outreach, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year.  Early application is permitted but only for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.    

January 1, 2018  

We will adopt the accounting guidance in this standard for non-insurance related products and services and are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.   

ASU 2015-09, Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts  

This standard enhances the disclosure requirements related to short-duration insurance contracts.  The new disclosure requirements focus on providing users of financial statements with more transparent information about an insurance entity s (1) initial claims estimates and subsequent adjustments to those estimates, (2) methodologies and judgments in estimating claims, and (3) timing, frequency and severity of claims.  Early application of this standard is permitted, and retrospective application is required for each comparative period presented, except for those requirements that apply only to the current period.  

Annual periods beginning January 1, 2016; interim periods within annual periods beginning January 1, 2017  

We are currently evaluating these disclosure changes and will provide the additional required disclosures if we determine they are material to our financial statements.  

ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  

These amendments require, among other things, the fair value measurement of investments in equity securities and certain other ownership interests that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  The change in fair value of the impacted investments in equity securities must be recognized in net income.  In addition, the amendments include certain enhancements to the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial assets and financial liabilities.  Early adoption of the ASU is generally not permitted, except as defined in the ASU.  The amendments should be adopted in the financial statements through a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings.  

January 1, 2018  

We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Standard  

Description  

Projected Date of Adoption  

Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters  

ASU 2016-02, Leases  

This standard establishes a new accounting model for leases.  Lessees will recognize most leases on the balance as a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability.  The lease liability is measured as the present value of the lease payments over the lease term with the right-of-use asset measured at the lease liability amount and includes adjustments for certain lease incentives and initial direct costs.  Lease expense recognition will continue to differentiate between finance leases and operating leases resulting in a similar pattern of lease expense recognition as under current GAAP.  This ASU permits a modified retrospective adoption approach that includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect upon adoption.  Early adoption is permitted.  

January 1, 2019  

We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.   

ASU 2016-05, Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships   

The amendments clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument identified in a hedging relationship in and of itself does not require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.  The ASU may be adopted prospectively or through a modified retrospective approach.  Early adoption is permitted.  

January 1, 2017  

We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.  

ASU 2016-06, Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments  

The amendments clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call and put options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. Upon adoption of this ASU, entities will be required to assess embedded call and put options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence that was developed by the FASB Derivatives Implementation Group.  The ASU should be adopted based on a modified retrospective basis for existing debt instruments.  Early adoption is permitted.    

January 1, 2017  

We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.  

ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  

These amendments clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in ASU 2014-09, including how an entity should identify the unit of accounting for the principal versus agent evaluation.  In addition, the amendments clarify how to apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements, such as service transactions, by explaining what a principal controls before the good or service is transferred to the customer.  Transition requirements are consistent with ASU 2014-09.     

January 1, 2018  

We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU, in coordination with ASU 2014-09, on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.  

ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting  

These amendments will require all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled rather than through additional paid in capital in the equity section of the balance sheet.  The amendments also permit an employer to repurchase an employee s shares at the maximum statutory tax rate in the employee s applicable jurisdiction for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting.  Finally, the amendments permit entities to make a one-time accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.  Specific adoption methods depend on the issue being adopted and range from prospective to retrospective adoption.  Early adoption is permitted; however, all amendments must be adopted in the same period.        

January 1, 2017  

We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Standard  

Description  

Projected Date of Adoption  

Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters  

ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  

These amendments clarify, among other things, the accounting guidance in ASU 2014-09 regarding how an entity will determine whether promised goods or services are separately identifiable, which is an important consideration in determining whether to account for goods or services as a separate performance obligation.   Transition requirements are consistent with ASU 2014-09.   

January 1, 2018  

We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU, in coordination with ASU 2014-09, on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.  

ASU 2016-12, Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  

The standard update amends the revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09 related to transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. The amendments clarify that, for a contract to be considered completed at transition, substantially all of the revenue must have been recognized under current GAAP.  The amendments also clarify how an entity should evaluate the collectability threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if an arrangement does not meet the standard s     contract criteria.  Transition requirements are consistent with ASU 2014-09.  

January 1, 2018  

We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU, in coordination with ASU 2014-09, on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.  

ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  

These amendments adopt a new model to measure and recognize credit losses for most financial assets.  The method used to measure estimated credit losses for available-for-sale ( AFS ) debt securities will be unchanged from current GAAP; however, the amendments require credit losses to be recognized through an allowance rather than as a reduction to the amortized cost of those debt securities.  The amendments will permit entities to recognize improvements in credit loss estimates on AFS debt securities by reducing the allowance account immediately through earnings.  The amendments will be adopted through a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of the first reporting period in which the amendments are effective. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein.           

January 1, 2020  

We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.  

ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  

These amendments clarify the classification of eight specific cash flow issues in an entity s Statement of Cash Flows where it was determined by the FASB that there is diversity in practice.  Early adoption is permitted, and retrospective transition is required for each period presented in the Statement of Cash Flows.    

January 1, 2018  

We are currently evaluating these disclosure requirements and will amend classifications in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows upon adoption as applicable.

3.  Variable Interest Entities  

Consolidated   VIEs  

See Note 4 in our 201  5   Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our consolidated VIEs,   which information is incorporated herein by reference  . 

The following summarizes information regarding the credit-linked note ( CLN ) structures (dollars in millions) as of September 30, 2016: 

The following summarizes the exposure of the CLN structures  underlying reference obligations by industry and rating as of September 30, 2016:  

10   

Asset and liability information (dollars in millions) for the consolidated VIEs included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows: 

(1) 

Reported in variable interest entities  fixed maturity securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.     

(2) 

Reported in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.     

(3) 

Reported in variable interest entities  liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.     

For details related to the fixed maturity AFS securities underlying these VIEs, see Note 4. 

As described more fully in Note 1 of our 2015 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ).  Based upon this review, we believe that the AFS   fixed maturity   securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2016.    

The gains (losses)   for the consolidated VIEs   (in millions) recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) were as follows: 

(1) 

Reported in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss  ).     

Unconsolidated VIEs 

See Note 4 in our 201  5   Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our unconsolidated VIEs, which information is incorporated herein by reference.  

Limited Partnerships and Limited Liability Companies 

We invest in certain limited partnerships ( LPs ) and limited liability companies ( LLCs ), including qualified affordable housing projects, that we have concluded are VIEs.  We do not hold any substantive kick-out or participation rights in the LPs and LLCs, and we do not receive any performance fees or decision maker fees from the LPs and LLCs.  Based on our analysis of the LPs and LLCs, we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the LPs and LLCs.   

The carrying amounts of our investments in the LPs and LLCs are recognized in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and were   $1.3   billion and   $1.2   billion as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Included in these carrying amounts are our investments in qualified affordable housing projects, which were   $40   million and   $47   million as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively.  We do not have any contingent commitments to provide additional capital funding to these qualified affordable housing projects.  We receive returns from these qualified affordable housing projects in the form of income tax credits and other tax benefits, which are recognized in federal income tax expense (benefit) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and were   $3   million and   less than    $  1   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

11   

Our exposure to loss is limited to the capital we invest in the LPs and LLCs, and there have been no indicators of impairment that would require us to recognize an impairment loss related to the LPs and LLCs as of September 30, 2016.    

4  .  Investments  

AFS Securities 

See   Note 1 in our   201  5 Form 10-K for information regarding our accounting policy relating to AFS securities, which also includes   additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.  

The   amortized cost, gross   unrealized gains and losses, OTTI and fair value of AFS securities (in millions) were as follows: 

(1) 

Includes unrealized gains and losses on impaired securities related to changes in the fair value of such securities subsequent to the impairment measurement date.     

12   

The amortized cost and   fair value of fixed maturity AFS securities by contractual maturities (in millions) as of   September 30  , 2016  , were as follows: 

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or pre-pay obligations. 

The fair value and gross unrealized losses, including the p  ortion of OTTI recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI )  , of AFS securities (dollars in millions), aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, were as follows: 

13   

For information regarding our investments in VIEs, see Note   3  . 

The fair value, gross unrealized losses, the portion of OTTI recognized in OCI (in millions) and number of AFS securities where the fair value had declined and remained   below amortized cost   by greater than 20% were as follows: 

(1) 

We may reflect a security in more than one aging category based on various purchase dates.       

We regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI.  Our gross unrealized losses, including the portion of OTTI recognized in OCI, on AFS securities   decreased by $  1.6   billion for   the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  As discussed further below, we believe the unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2016, did not represent OTTI as (i) we did not intend to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost; (iii) the estimated future cash flows were equal to or greater than the amortized cost of the debt securities; and (iv) we had the ability and intent to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery.       

14   

Based upon this evaluation as of   September 30  , 2016, management believes we have the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash from our normal operations (e.g., insurance premiums and fees and investment income) to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety without requiring the sale of our temporarily-impaired securities.  

As of   September 30  , 2016, the unrealized losses associated with our corporate bond securities were attributable primarily to widening credit spreads and rising interest rates since purchase.  We performed a detailed analysis of the financial performance of the underlying issuers and determined that we expected to recover the entire amortized cost for each   temporarily-impaired security. 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,    the unrealized losses associated with our   mortgage-backed securities     (   MBS   )   and ABS were attributable primarily to   credit spreads.    We assessed credit impairment using a cash flow model that incorporates key assumptions including default rates, s  everities and prepayment rates.    We estimated losses for a security by forecasting the underlying loans in each transaction.      The forecasted loan performance was used to project cash flows to the various tranches in the structure, as applicable.      Our forecasted cash flows also considered, as applicable, independent industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings and other independent market data.      Based upon our assessment of the expected credit losses of the security given the   performance of the underlying collateral compared to our subordination or other credit enhancement, we expected to recover the entire amortized cost of each temporarily-impaired security. 

As of   September 30  , 2016, the unrealized losses associated with our hybrid and redeemable preferred securities were attributable primarily to wider credit spreads caused by illiquidity in the market and subordination within the capital structure, as well as credit risk of underlying issuers.  For our hybrid and redeemable preferred securities, we evaluated the financial performance of the underlying issuers based upon credit performance and investment ratings and determined that we expected to recover the entire amortized cost of each   temporarily-impaired   security  . 

Changes in the amount of credit loss of OTTI recognized in net income (loss) where the portion related to other factors was recognized in OCI (in millions) on fixed maturity AFS securities were as follows: 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     and 2015, we recorded   credit losses on securities for which an OTTI was not previously recognized as we determined the cash flows expected to be collected would not be sufficient to recover the   entire amortized cost of   the debt security.  The credit losses we recorded on securities for which an OTTI was not previously recognized were attributable primarily to one or a combination of the following reasons: 

Failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments;     

Deterioration of creditworthiness of the issuer;     

Deterioration of conditions specifically related to the security;     

Deterioration of fundamentals of the industry in which the issuer operates; and     

Deterioration of the rating of the security by a rating agency.     

We recognize the OTTI attributed to the noncredit portion as a separate component in OCI referred to as unrealized OTTI on AFS securities.   

15   

Details of the amount of credit loss of OTTI recognized in net income (loss) for which a portion related to other factors was recognized in OCI (in millions), were as follows: 

Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 

See Note 1 in our 2015 Form 10-K for information regarding our accounting policy relating to mortgage loans on real estate. 

Mortgage loans on real estate principally involve commercial   real estate.  The commercial loans are geographically diversified throughout the U.S. with the largest concentrations in California  , which accounted for 20% and 21%, respectively, and   Texas, which accounted for   11% and 10%, respectively,   of mortgage loans on real   estate as of September 30, 2016,   and December 31, 2015. 

The following provides the current and past due composition of our mortgage loans on real estate (in millions): 

The number of impaired mortgage loans on real estate, each of which had an associated specific valuation allowance, and the carrying value of impaired mortgag  e loans on real estate (dollars   in millions) were as follows:

As described in Note 1 in our   2015 F  orm 10-K, we use the loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios as credit quality indicators for our mortgage loans, which were as follows (dollars in millions): 

Alternative Investments  

As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31  , 201  5  ,   alternative   investments   included investments   in   198   and   1  90   different partnerships, respectively, and   the portfolio represented approximately   1%   of our overall invested assets. 

Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments  

The detail of the realized gain (loss) related to certain investments (in millions) was as follows:

Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTI (in millions) that were recognized in net income (loss) and included in realized gain (loss) on AFS securities above, and the portion of OTTI recognized in OCI (in millions) were as follows: 

Determination of Credit L  osses on Corporate Bonds and ABS 

As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31,   2015, we   reviewed our corporate bond and ABS portfolios for potential shortfall in contractual principal and interest based on numerous subjective and objective inputs.      The factors used to determine the amount of credit loss for each individual security, include, but are not limited to, near term risk, substantial discrepancy between book and market value, sector or company-specific volatility, negative operating trends and trading levels wider than peers. 

Credit ratings express opinions about   the credit quality of a security.  Securities rated investment grade, that is those rated BBB- or higher by Standard   Poor s ( S P ) Rating Services or Baa3 or higher by Moody s Investors Service ( Moody s ), are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk.  As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015,   95%   and   96%  , respectively, of the fair value of our corporate bond portfol  io was rated investment grade.    As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the portion of our   corporate bond portfolio rated below investment grade had an amortized cost of $  4.0   billion and   $3.6   billion, respectively, and a fair value of $  3.8   billion and    $  3.3   billion, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015  , 96%   of the fair value of our ABS portfolio was rated investment grade.  As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the portion of our ABS portfolio rated below investment grade had an amortized cost of $  103   million and $  107   million, respectively, and a fair value of   $88   million and $  92   million, respectively.  Based upon the analysis discussed above, we believe as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, that we would recover the amortized cost of each fixed maturity security  . 

Determination of Credit Losses on MBS 

As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December   31, 2015, default   rates were projected by considering underlying MBS loan performance and collateral type.  Projected default rates on existing delinquencies vary between approximately   10%   to   100%   depending on loan type and severity of delinquency status.  In addition, we estimate the potential contributions of currently performing loans that may become delinquent in the future based on the change in delinquencies and loan liquidations experienced in the recent history.  Finally, we develop a default rate timing curve by aggregating the defaults for all loans in the pool (delinquent loans, foreclosure and real estate owned and new delinquencies from currently performing loans) and the associated loan-level loss severities.   

We use certain available loan characteristics such as lien status, loan sizes and occupancy to estimate the loss severity of loans.  Second lien loans are assigned   100%   severity, if defaulted.  For first lien loans, we assume a minimum of   30%   severity with higher severity assumed for investor properties and further adjusted by housing price assumptions.  With the default rate timing curve and loan-level   loss   severity, we derive the future expected credit losses. 

18   

Payables for Collateral on Investments 

The carrying value of the payables for collateral on investments (in millions) included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and the fair value of the related investments or collateral consisted of the following: 

(1) 

We obtain collateral based upon contractual provisions with our counterparties.  These agreements take into consideration the counterparties  credit rating as compared to ours, the fair value of the derivative investments and specified thresholds that if exceeded result in the receipt of cash that is typically invested in cash and invested cash.  See Note 5 for additional information.     

(2) 

Our pledged securities under securities lending agreements are included in fixed maturity AFS securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We generally obtain collateral in an amount equal to   102  % and   105  % of the fair value of the domestic and foreign securities, respectively.  We value collateral daily and obtain additional collateral when deemed appropriate.  The cash received in our securities lending program is typically invested in cash and invested cash or fixed maturity AFS securities.     

(3) 

Our pledged securities under repurchase agreements are included in fixed maturity AFS securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We obtain collateral in an amount equal to   95  % of the fair value of the securities, and our agreements with third parties contain contractual provisions to allow for additional collateral to be obtained when necessary.  The cash received in our repurchase program is typically invested in fixed maturity AFS securities.     

(4) 

Our pledged investments for FHLBI are included in fixed maturity AFS securities and mortgage loans on real estate on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The collateral requirements are generally   105  % to   115  % of the fair value for fixed maturity AFS securities and   155  % to   175  % of the fair value   of   mortgage loans on real estate.  The cash received in these transactions is primarily invested in cash and invested cash or fixed maturity AFS securities.     

Increase (decrease) in payables for collateral on investments (in millions  )   consisted of the following: 

19   

We have elected not to offset our repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions in our financial statements.    The remaining contractual maturities of repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions accounted for as secured borrowings were as follows: 

We accept collateral in the form of securities in connection with repurchase agreements.  In instances where we are permitted to sell or re-pledge the securities received, we record the fair value of the collateral received and a related obligation to return the collateral in the financial statements.  In addition, we receive   securities in connection with securities borrowing agreements that we are permitted to sell or re-pledge.  As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of all collateral received that we are permitted to sell or re-pledge was $  175   million.  As of September 30, 2016, we have not sold or re-pledged this collateral. 

Investment Commitments 

As of   September   30, 2016, our   investment commitments were $  1.4   billion, which included $  727   million of LPs, $  503   million of mortgage loans on real estate and $  186   million of private placement   securities. 

Concentrations of Financial Instruments 

As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, our most significant investments in one issuer were our investments in securities issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation with a fair value of $  1.7   billion and $  1.8   billion, respectively, or   2  % of our invested assets portfolio, and our investments in securities issued by Fannie Mae with a fair value of $  1.2   billion, or   1  % of our invested assets portfolio.   

As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, our most significant investments in one industry were our investments in securities in the consumer non-cyclical industry with a fair value of $  14.4   billion and $  12.0   billion, respectively, or   13%   and   12%  , respectively, of our invested assets portfolio, and our investments in securities in the utilities industry with a fair value of   $14.0   billion and $  12.8   billion, respectively, or   13% and 12%, respectively,   of our invested assets portfolio.  These concentrations include both AFS and trading securities  .

5.  Derivative Instruments 

We maintain an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk, default risk, basis risk and credit risk.  See Note 1 in our   2015 Form   10-K for a detailed discussion of the accounting treatment for derivative instruments.  See Note 6 in   our 2015 Form   10-K for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments and use of them in our overall risk management strategy, which information is incorporated herein by reference.  See Note   12   for additional disclosures related to the fair value of our derivative instruments and Note   3   for   derivative instruments related to our consolidated VIEs. 

We have derivati  ve instruments with off-balance   sheet risks whose notional or contract amounts exceed the   related   credit exposure.  Outstanding derivati  ve instruments with off-balance   sheet risks (in millions) were as follows: 

(1) 

Reported   in derivative investments and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.     

(2) 

Reported   in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The maturity of the notional amounts of derivative instruments (in millions) was as follows: 

(1) 

As of   September 30  , 2016, the latest maturity date for which we were hedging our exposure to the variability in future cash flows for these instruments was   April 2067  .     

(2) 

As of   September   30, 2016, the latest maturity date for which we were hedging our exposure to the variability in future cash flows for these instruments was   December 2045  .

The gains (losses) on derivative instruments (in millions) recorded within income (loss) from continuing operations on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) were as follows: 

(1) 

Reported   in   net investment income on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).     

(2) 

Reported   in   interest and debt expense on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Reported   in   commissions and other expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).     

Gains (losses) recognized as a component of OCI   (in millions) on derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges were as follows:  

As of   September 30,   2016,   $  (1)   million   of the deferred net   gains (  losses  )   on derivative instruments in   A  OCI were expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months.  This reclassification would be due primarily to interest rate variances related to   our   interest rate swap agreements. 

For   the   nine   months ended   September   30  , 2016   and 201  5  , there were     no   material reclassifications to earnings due to hedged firm commitments no longer deemed probable or due to hedged forecasted transactions that had not occurred by the end of the originally specified time period. 

23   

Information related to our open credit default swap  s   for which we are the seller   (dollars in millions)   was as follows: 

(1) 

Represents average credit ratings based on the midpoint of the applicable ratings among Moody s, S P and   Fitch Ratings, as scaled to the corresponding S P ratings.     

(2) 

Broker   quotes are used to determine the market value of these credit default swaps.     

(3) 

These credit default swaps were sold to a counterparty of the consolidated VIEs discussed in Note 4 in our 201  5   Form 10-K.     

(4) 

Credit default swaps were entered into in order to generate income by providing default protection in return for a quarterly payment.     

(5) 

Sellers do not have the right to demand indemnification or compensation from third parties in case of a loss (payment) on the contract.      

Details underlying the associated collateral of our open credit default sw  aps for which we are the seller   if credit risk  -  related contingent features were triggered (in millions)   were   as follows: 

Certain of our credit default swap agreements contain contractual provisions that allow for the netting of collateral with our counterparties related to all of our collateralized financing transactions that we have outstanding.  If these netting agreements were not in place, we would have been required to   post   less than     $  1   million   as of   September   30, 2016.       

Credit Risk 

We are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by our counterparties on various derivative contracts and reflect assumptions regarding the credit or non-performance risk ( NPR ).    The NPR is based upon assumptions for each counterparty s credit spread over the estimated weighted average life of the counterparty exposure less collateral held.      As of   September 30, 2016  , the NPR adjustment was     less than $1 million  .  The credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by   entering into   agreements   with   financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance records.  Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association ( ISDA ) Master Agreement.  We are required to maintain minimum ratings as a matter of routine practice in negotiating ISDA agreements.  Under some ISDA agreements, our insurance subsidiaries have agreed to maintain certain financial strength or claims-paying ratings.  A downgrade below these levels could result in termination of derivative contracts, at which time any amounts payable by us would be dependent on the market value of the underlying derivative contracts.  In certain transactions, we and the counterparty have entered into a credit support annex requiring either party to post collateral when net exposures exceed pre-determined thresholds.  These thresholds vary by counterparty and credit rating.  The amount of such exposure is essentially the net replacement cost or market value   less collateral held for such agreements with each counterparty if the net market value is in our favor.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our exposure was     $  4   million  .   

24   

The amounts recognized (in mi  llions) by S P credit rating of counterparty   for which we had the right to reclaim cash collateral or were obligated to return cash collateral were as follows: 

Balance Sheet Offsetting 

Information related to our deri  vative instruments   a  nd the   effects of offsetting on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions)   was   as follows:       

25   

6.  Federal Income Taxes 

The effective tax rate is the ratio of tax expense over pre-tax income (loss).  The effective tax rate was   24%   and   21%   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  The effective tax rate was   15%   and   19%   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The effective tax rate on pre-tax income from continuing operations was lower than the prevailing corporate federal income tax rate.  Differences in the effective rates and the U.S. statutory rate of   35  % were the result of certain tax preferred investment income, separate account dividends-received deductions, foreign tax credits a  nd other tax preference items.    The effective tax rate on the pre-tax income from continuing operations was higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.  This increase was   due   primarily to a higher level of pre-tax income that caused the tax preference items to have a less significant impact in 2016, partially offset by higher tax benefits primarily attributable to the release of reserves associated with prior tax years that closed in the third quarter of 2016. 

7.  Guaranteed Benefit Features  

Information on the guaranteed death benefit ( GDB ) features outstanding (dollars in millions) was as follows: 

(1) 

Our variable contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract; therefore, the amounts listed are not mutually exclusive.     

(2) 

Represents   the amount of death benefit in excess of the account balance that is subject to market fluctuations.     

26   

The determination of GDB liabilities is based on models that involve a range of scenarios and assumptions, including those regarding expected market rates of return and volatility, contract surrender rates and mortality experience.  The following summarizes the balances of and changes in the liabilities for GDBs (in millions), which were recorded in future contract benefits on our Consolidated Balance Sheets: 

Variable Annuity Contracts 

Account balances of variable annuity contracts  , including those   with guarantees  ,   (in millions)     were invested in separate account investment options as follows: 

Secondary Guarantee Products 

Future contract benefits and other contract holder funds include reserves for our secondary guarantee products sold through our Life Insurance segment.  These UL and VUL products with secondary guarantees   represented   35  %   of total life insurance in-force reserves as of   September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015.  UL and VUL products with secondary guarantees represented 35  %     and   33%   of total sales for the   three and     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to   33%   and   32%   for the corresponding periods in 2015  . 

8.  Contingencies and Commitments 

Regulatory bodies, such as state insurance departments, the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and other regulatory bodies regularly make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations concerning our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws, securities laws, laws governing the activities of broker-dealers, registered investment advisors and unclaimed property laws. 

LNC and its subsidiaries are involved in various pending or threatened legal or regulatory proceedings, including purported class actions, arising from the conduct of business both in the ordinary course and otherwise.  In some of the matters, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought.  Modern pleading practice in the U.S. permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary damages or other relief.  Jurisdictions may permit claimants not to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court.  In addition, jurisdictions may permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for similar matters.  This variability in pleadings, together with the actual experiences of LNC in litigating or resolving through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of time, demonstrates to management that the monetary relief which may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to its merits or disposition value. 

Due to the unpredictable nature of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time is normally difficult to ascertain.  Uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.  Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law. 

We establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when information related to the loss contingencies shows both that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that some matters could  

27   

require us to pay damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be estimated as of September 30, 2016. 

While the potential future charges could be material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on information currently known by management, management does not believe any such charges are likely to have a material adverse effect on LNC s financial condition. 

For some matters, the Company is able to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss.  For such matters in which a loss is probable, an accrual has been made.  For such matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, no accrual has been made.  Accordingly, the estimate contained in this paragraph reflects two types of matters.  For some matters included within this estimate, an accrual has been made, but there is a reasonable possibility that an exposure exists in excess of the amount accrued.  In these cases, the estimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued amount.  For other matters included within this estimation, no accrual has been made because a loss, while potentially estimable, is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable.  In these cases, the estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.  As of September 30, 2016, we estimate the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses to be up to approximately $50     million.  

For other matters, we are not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.  We are often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by the court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts and the progress of settlement negotiations.  On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to litigation contingencies and update our accruals, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews  . 

Helen Hanks v. The Lincoln Life and Annuity Company of New York ( LLANY ) and Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company ( Voya )  , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 16cv6399, is a putative class action that was served on LLANY on August 12, 2016.  Plaintiff owns a universal life policy originally issued by Aetna (now Voya) and alleges that (i) Voya breached the terms of the policy when it increased cost of insurance ( COI ) rates on plaintiff s policy; and (ii) LLANY, as reinsurer and administrator of Plaintiff s policy, engaged in wrongful conduct related to the COI increase, and was unjustly enriched as a result.  Plaintiff seeks to represent all owners of Aetna life insurance policies that were subject to COI rate increases in 2016 and seeks damages on their behalf.  We are vigorously defending this matter. 

See Note 13 in our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 8 in our Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016, and June 30, 2016, for additional discussion of commitments and contingencies, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 

9.  Shares and Stockholders  Equity 

Common Shares 

The changes in our common stock (number of shares) were as follows: 

Our common stock   is   without par value. 

28   

Average Shares 

A reconciliation of the denominator (number of shares) in the calculations of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share was as follows: 

In the event the average market price of LNC common stock exceeds the issue price of stock options and the options have a dilutive effect to our earnings per share ( EPS ), such options will be shown in the table above. 

We have participants in our deferred compensation plans who selected LNC stock as the measure for the investment return attributable to all or a portion of their deferral amounts.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the effect of settling this obligation in LNC stock ( equity classification ) was more dilutive than the scenario of settling in cash ( liability classification ).  Therefore, for our EPS calculation for these periods, we added these shares to the denominator and adjusted the numerator to present net income as if the shares had been accounted for under equity classification by removing the mark-to-market adjustment included in net income attributable to these deferred units of LNC stock.  The amount of this adjustment was $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and   $  7 million and   $  6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

10.  Realized Gain (Loss) 

Details underlying realized gain (loss) (in millions) reported on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) were as follows: 

(1) 

See  Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments  section in Note 4.     

(2) 

Represents changes in the fair values of certain derivative investments (not including those associated with our variable and indexed annuity and IUL contracts net derivatives results), reinsurance related embedded derivatives and trading securities.     

(3) 

Represents the net difference between the change in the fair value of the S P   500 Index     call options that we hold and the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our indexed annuity and IUL contracts along with changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products.     

(4) 

Includes the net difference in the change in embedded derivative reserves of our guaranteed living benefits ( GLB ) riders and the change in the fair value of the derivative investments we own to hedge the change in embedded derivative reserves on our GLB riders and the benefit ratio unlocking on our GLB and GDB riders, including the cost of purchasing the hedging instruments.     

11  .  Stock-Based Compensation Plans 

We sponsor   stock-based   compensation   plans for our employees and directors and for the employees and agents of our subsidiaries that provide for the   grant   of stock options, performance shares (performance-vested shares as opposed to service-vested shares), stock a  ppreciation rights ( SARs ),   restricted stock units ( RSUs )   and deferred stock units ( DSUs )  .  We issue new shares to satisfy option exercises. 

LNC stock-based awards granted were as follows: 

32   

12.    Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The carrying values and estimated fair values of our financial instruments (in millions) were as follows: 

(1) 

We have master netting agreements with each of our derivative counterparties, which allow for the netting of our derivative asset and liability positions by counterparty.     

(2) 

Includes credit default swaps in an asset position associated with consolidated VIEs.     

(3) 

The difference between the carrying value and fair value of short-term debt as of September 30, 2016, related to current maturities of long-term debt.      

(4) 

Portions of our GLB reserves embedded derivatives are ceded to third-party reinsurance counterparties.  Refer to Note 5 for additional detail.     

Valuation Methodologies and Associated Inputs for Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value 

The following discussion outlines the methodologies and assumptions used to determine the fair value of our financial instruments not carried at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Considerable judgment is required to develop these assumptions used to measure fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates shown are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a one-time, current market exchange of all of our financial instruments.  

Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 

The fair value of mortgage loans on real estate is established using a discounted cash flow method based on credit rating, maturity and future income.  The ratings for mortgages in good standing are based on property type, location, market conditions, occupancy, debt-service coverage, loan-to-value, quality of tenancy, borrower and payment record.  The fair value for impaired mortgage loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  The inputs used to measure the fair value of our mortgage loans on real estate are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  

33   

Other Investments 

The carrying value of our assets classified as other investments approximates fair value.  Other investments includes primarily LPs and other privately held investments that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and the carrying value is based on our proportional share of the net assets of the LPs.  The inputs used to measure the fair value of our LPs and other privately held investments are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  Other investments also includes securities that are not LPs or other privately held investments and the inputs used to measure the fair value of these securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. 

Other Contract Holder Funds 

Other contract holder funds include remaining guaranteed interest and similar contracts and account values of certain investment contracts.  The fair value for the remaining guaranteed interest and similar contracts is estimated using discounted cash flow calculations as of the balance sheet date.  These calculations are based on interest rates currently offered on similar contracts with maturities that are consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued.  As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the remaining guaranteed interest and similar contracts carrying value approximated fair value.  The fair value of the account values of certain investment contracts is based on their approximate surrender value as of the balance sheet date.  The inputs used to measure the fair value of our other contract holder funds are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. 

Short-Term and Long-Term Debt       

The fair value of short-term and long-term debt is based on quoted market prices.  The inputs used to measure the fair value of our short-term and long-term debt are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.     

Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value 

We did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2016, or December 31, 2015, and we noted no changes in our valuation methodologies between these periods.  

34   

The following summarizes our financial instruments carried at fair value (in millions) on a recurring basis by the fair value hierarchy levels described in  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in Note 1 of our 2015 Form 10-K: 

35   

(1) 

Derivative investment assets and liabilities presented within the fair value hierarchy are presented on a gross basis by derivative type and not on a master netting basis by counterparty.     

(2) 

Includes credit default swaps in an asset position associated with consolidated VIEs.     

36   

The following summarizes changes to our financial instruments carried at fair value (in millions) and classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  This summary excludes any effect of amortization of deferred acquisition costs ( DAC ), value of business acquired ( VOBA ), deferred sales inducements ( DSI ) and deferred front-end loads ( DFEL ).  The gains and losses below may include changes in fair value due in part to observable inputs that are a component of the valuation methodology. 

37   

38   

39   

(1) 

The changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by an adjustment to derivative investments (see Note 5).     

(2) 

Transfers into or out of Level 3 for AFS and trading securities are displayed at amortized cost as of the beginning-of-period.  For AFS and trading securities, the difference between beginning-of-period amortized cost and beginning-of-period fair value was included in OCI and earnings, respectively, in the prior period.     

(3) 

Amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts are included in net investment income on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Gains (losses) from sales, maturities, settlements and calls and OTTI are included in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).     

(4) 

The changes in fair value of the credit default swaps and contingency forwards are included in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).     

(5) 

Gains (losses) from sales, maturities, settlements and calls are included in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).     

40   

The following provides the components of the items included in issuances, sales, maturities, settlements and calls, net, excluding any effect of amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in future contract benefits, (in millions) as reported above: 

41   

The following summarizes changes in unrealized gains (losses) included in net income, excluding any effect of amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in future contract benefits, related to financial instruments carried at fair value classified within Level 3 that we still held (in millions): 

(1) 

Included in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).      

42   

The following provides the components of the transfers into and out of Level 3 (in millions) as reported above: 

Transfers into and out of Level 3 are generally the result of observable market information on a security no longer being available or becoming available to our pricing vendors.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, transfers in and out of Level 3 were attributable primarily to the securities  observable market information no longer being available or becoming available.  Transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 are generally the result of a change in the type of input used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability at the end of the reporting period.  When quoted prices in active markets become available, transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 will result.  When quoted prices in active markets become unavailable, but we are able to employ a valuation methodology using significant observable inputs, transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 will result.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy were less than $1 million for our financial instruments carried at fair value.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy were $172 million for our financial instruments carried at fair value, which was attributable to quoted market prices being available. 

43   

The following summarizes the fair value (in millions), valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs of the Level 3 fair value measurements as of September 30, 2016: 

(1) 

The   liquidity  /duration adjustment input represents an estimated market participant composite of adjustments attributable to liquidity premiums, expected durations, structures and credit quality that would be applied to the market observable information of an investment.     

(2) 

The lapse rate input represents the estimated probability of a contract surrendering during a year, and thereby forgoing any future benefits.    The   range for indexed annuity and IUL contracts represents the lapse rates during the surrender charge period.     

(3) 

The utilization   of   guaranteed withdrawals input represents the estimated percentage of contract holders that utilize the guaranteed withdrawal feature.     

(4) 

The utilization factors are applied to the present value of claims or premiums, as appropriate, in the GLB reserve calculation to estimate the impact of inefficient withdrawal behavior, including taking less than or more than the maximum guaranteed withdrawal.     

(5) 

The NPR input represents the estimated additional credit spread that market participants would apply to the market observable discount rate when pricing a contract.     

(6) 

The   mortality rate input represents the estimated probability of when an individual belonging to a particular group, categorized according to age or some other factor such as gender, will die.     

(7) 

The   volatility input represents overall volatilities assumed for the underlying variable annuity funds, which include a mixture of equity and fixed-income assets.  Fair value of the variable annuity GLB embedded derivatives would increase if higher volatilities were used for valuation.     

(8) 

The mortality rate is based on a combination of company and industry experience, adjusted for improvement factors.     

From the table above, we have excluded Level 3 fair value measurements obtained from independent, third-party pricing sources.  We do not develop the significant inputs used to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities, and the information regarding the significant inputs is not readily available to us.  Independent broker-quoted fair values are non-binding quotes developed by market  

44   

makers or broker-dealers obtained from third-party sources recognized as market participants.  The fair value of a broker-quoted asset or liability is based solely on the receipt of an updated quote from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant as we do not adjust broker quotes when used as the fair value measurement for an asset or liability.  Significant increases or decreases in any of the quotes received from a third-party broker-dealer may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.   

Changes in any of the significant inputs presented in the table above may result in a significant change in the fair value measurement of the asset or liability as follows: 

Investments     An increase in the liquidity/duration adjustment input would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement.     

Reinsurance recoverable asset     An increase in our lapse rate, NPR or mortality rate inputs would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement; and an increase in the utilization of guarantee withdrawal or volatility inputs would result in an increase in the fair value measurement.      

Indexed annuity and IUL contracts embedded derivatives     An increase in the lapse rate or mortality rate inputs would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement.       

GLB reserves embedded derivatives     Assuming our GLB reserves embedded derivatives are in a liability position:  an increase in our lapse rate, NPR or mortality rate inputs would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement; and an increase in the utilization of guarantee withdrawal or volatility inputs would result in an increase in the fair value measurement.     

For each category discussed above, the unobservable inputs are not inter-related; therefore, a directional change in one input will not affect the other inputs.   

As part of our ongoing valuation process, we assess the reasonableness of our valuation techniques or models and make adjustments as necessary.  For more information, see    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in Note 1 of our 2015 Form 10-K  . 

13  .  Segment Information  

We provide products and services and report results through our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments.  We also have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments.  Our reporting segments reflect the manner by which our chief operating decision makers view and manage the business.  See Note 2  1   of our   2015   Form 10-K for a brief description of these segments and Other Operations. 

Segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are internal measures used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate and assess the results of our segments.  Income (loss) from operations is GAAP net income excluding the after-tax effects of the following items, as applicable: 

Realized gains and   losses   associated with the following ( excluded realized gain (loss) ):      

Sales or disposals and impairments of securities;     

Changes in the fair value of derivatives, embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and trading securities;     

Changes in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge our GDB riders within our variable annuities;     

Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our GLB riders reflected within variable annuity net derivative results accounted for at fair value;

Item 2.      Management s     Discussion   and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following Management s Discussion and Analysis ( MD A ) is intended to help the reader understand the financial condition as of September 30, 2016, compared with December 31, 2015, and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the corresponding periods in 2015 of Lincoln National Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires,  LNC,   Company,   we,   our  or  us  refers to Lincoln National Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.  The MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements ( Notes ) presented in  Part I   Item 1. Financial Statements  our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015 Form 10-K ), including the sections entitled  Part I   Item 1A. Risk Factors,   Part II   Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and  Part II   Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed in 2016; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2016.  For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the Company s business activities, see the risks described in  Part I   Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated by  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q. 

In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments.  Financial information that follows is presented in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), unless otherwise indicated.  See Note 1 in our 2015 Form 10-K for a discussion of GAAP. 

Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments.  Accordingly, we define and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 13.  Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments.  In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business.

actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and class action cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;     

A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries  products, a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of the net amortization of deferred acquisition costs ( DAC ), value of business acquired ( VOBA ), deferred sales inducements ( DSI ) and deferred front-end loads ( DFEL ) and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries  variable annuity products;     

Ineffectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures, including various hedging strategies used to offset the effect of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;     

A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries  products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the net amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, which may reduce future earnings;      

Changes in GAAP, including convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards, that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income;     

Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse effect such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on our liquidity and financial condition;     

Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse effect such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;     

Significant credit, accounting, fraud, corporate governance or other issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios, as well as counterparties to which we are exposed to credit risk, requiring that we realize losses on investments;     

Inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others;     

Interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other operational systems or failure to safeguard the confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data on such systems from cyberattacks or other breaches of our data security systems;

The adequacy and collectability of reinsurance that we have purchased;     

Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;     

Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;     

The unknown effect on our subsidiaries  businesses resulting from changes in the demographics of their client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and     

Loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.     

The risks included here are not exhaustive.  Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance.  Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment.  New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.  

Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.  In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.   

IN    TRODUCTION 

Ex    ecutive Summary

C    ritical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The MD A included in our   2015   Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.  The following information updates the  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  provided in our   2015   Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  discussed in our   2015   Form 10-K. 

DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL 

Unlocking 

As stated in  Part II   Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   Unlocking  in our 2015 Form 10-K, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products in the third quarter of each year.    As a result of this review, we recorded unlocking on an annual basis that resulted in increases and decreases to the carrying values of these items.  See  DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL  in Note 1 of our 2015 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our unlocking process. 

Details underlying the effect to income (loss) from continuing operations from our unlocking as a result of our annual comprehensive review (in millions) were as follows: 

Unlocking was driven primarily by the following: 

2016 

For Annuities, we modified our capital markets and interest rate assumptions and other items, partially offset by modifying our policyholder behavior assumptions.     

For Retirement Plan Services, we modified our policyholder behavior, capital markets and interest rate assumptions, partially offset by modifying other items.     

For Life Insurance, we modified   certain   in-force   policy charges,   expense assumptions and other items, partially offset by   updating   our interest rate and mortality assumptions.     

For excluded realized gain (loss), we modified our policyholder behavior and capital markets assumptions, partially offset by modifying other items.     

2015 

As part of our annual comprehensive review in the third quarter of 2015, we lowered our long-term new money investment yield assumption to reflect the current new money rates and lower anticipated future interest rates.  This reduction in the interest rate assumption resulted in resetting the path of new money investment rates, reflecting a gradual annual recovery over five years to a rate 50 basis points below our prior ultimate long-term assumption.  As a result of lowering the ultimate long-term assumption 50 basis points, we recorded unfavorable unlocking of $118 million, after-tax, for Life Insurance, $2 million, after-tax, for Annuities, and $1 million, after-tax, for Retirement Plan Services.  

For Annuities, we modified our policyholder behavior and variable annuity expense assessments assumptions, substantially offset by modifying our capital markets and interest rate assumptions.     

For Retirement Plan Services, we modified our policyholder behavior assumptions, substantially offset by modifying our capital markets and interest rate assumptions and other items.     

For Life Insurance, we modified our interest rate and mortality assumptions, partially offset by modifying our premium persistency and policyholder behavior assumptions and other items.     

49   

For excluded realized gain (loss), we modified our variable annuity expense assessments and capital markets assumptions, partially offset by modifying our policyholder behavior assumptions and other items.     

Reversion to the Mean 

As variable fund returns do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which   EGPs   are projected, which we refer to as our reversion to the mean ( RTM ) process, as discussed in our 2015 Form 10-K.   

If we had unlocked our RTM assumption as of September 30, 2016, we would have recorded a favorable unlocking of approximately $135 million, pre-tax, for Annuities, approximately $20 million, pre-tax, for Retirement Plan Services, and approximately $20 million, pre-tax, for Life Insurance. 

Investments 

Investment Valuation  

The following summarizes our available-for-sale ( AFS ) and trading securities and derivative investments carried at fair value by pricing source and fair value hierarchy level (in millions) as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 

Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute fair value.      

For more information about the valuation of our financial instruments carried at fair value, see  Part II   Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Introduction   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   Investments   Investment Valuation  in our   2015   Form 10-K and Note   12   herein. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive.  We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions.  We use unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information.    We obtain broker quotes   for securities   such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) when sufficient security structure or other market information is not available to produce an evaluation.    For broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as market participants.    Broker-quoted securities are based solely on receipt of updated quotes from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant.    Our broker-quoted only securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,    we used broker quotes for 21   securities as our final price source,   representing   less than   1%   of total securities owned.  

Derivatives  

Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential effect on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in Note   5   of this report and  Part II   Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in our   2015   Form 10-K. 

Guaranteed Living Benefits 

Within our individual annuity business,   approximately 66%   of our variable annuity account values contained   guaranteed living benefits ( GLB )   features as of   September 30, 2016  .    Underperforming   equity markets increase our exposure to potential   benefits with the GLB features.  A   contract with a GLB feature is  in the money  if the contract holder s account balance falls below the present value of guaranteed withdrawal or income benefits, assuming no lapses.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,    9  %   and   11  %, respectively, of all in-force contracts with a GLB feature were  in the money,  and our exposure, after reinsurance, as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,    was $  624   million and $  639   million, respectively.  However, the only way the contract holder can realize the excess of the present value of benefits over the account value of the contract is through a series of withdrawals or income payments that do not exceed a maximum amount.  If, after the series of withdrawals or income payments, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will continue to  

50   

receive a series of annuity payments.  The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the present value of benefits over account value.

RESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS 

Details underlying the consolidated results, de    posits, net flows and account values (in millions) were as follows:    

51   

Compariso  n of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 to 2015 

Net income in  creased due primarily to the following:    

The effect of unlocking  .     

Favorable variable annuity net derivatives results.      

Increase in average account values due t  o higher average equity markets.     

Growth in business in force.     

More favorable total non-medical loss ratio experience in our Group Protection segment.     

Higher tax benefits attributable to the release of reserves associated with prior tax years that closed in the third quarter of 2016.     

The increase in net income was partially offset by s  pread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields, partially offset by actions implemented to     reduce interest crediting rates. 

Compariso  n of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 to 2015 

Net income in  creased due primarily to the following:    

The effect of unlocking.     

Favorable variable annuity net derivatives results.      

Growth in business in force.     

More favorable total non-medical loss ratio experience in our Group Protection segment.     

The increase in net income was partially offset by the following:  

Higher realized losses driven by asset disposals and an increase in   other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI )   attributable to individual credit risks within our corporate bond holdings.        

Higher legal expenses related to certain investments.     

Less favorable investment income on alternative investments.     

Decline in average account values due to lower average equity markets.     

Spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields, partially offset by actions implemented to     reduce interest crediting rates.     

52   

RESULTS OF ANNUITIES 

Inc    ome (Loss) from Operations 

Details underlying the results for Annuities (in millions) were as follows: 

(1) 

Insurance premiums include   primarily our   income annuities that have a   corresponding offset in     benefits  .  Benefits include changes in income annuity reserves driven by premiums.      

(2) 

See  Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking  below.     

(3) 

Consists primarily of revenues   attributable to broker-dealer services that are subject to market volatility.     

Comparison of the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   to   2015 

I  ncome fro  m operations for this segment de  creased due primarily to   higher commissions and other expenses due to the effect of unlocking; and higher account values resulting in higher trail commissions. 

The decrease in income from operations was partially offset primarily by the following: 

Lower benefits due to the effect of unlocking.     

High  er fee income driven by   high  er average daily variable account values as a result of   high  er average equity markets  .     

Comparison of the   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   to   2015 

I  ncome fro  m operations for this segment de  creased due primarily to   the following: 

Higher benefits attributable to an increase in the growth in benefit reserves due to lower average equity markets, partially offset by the effect of unlocking.     

L  ower fee income driven by lower average daily variable account values as a result of lower average equity markets   and negative net flows.     

Higher commissions and other expenses due to the effect of unlocking; and higher asset-based commission rates resulting in higher trail commissions.  This increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense as a result of lower actual gross profits and amortization rates and lower incentive compensation as a result of production performance.     

The de  crease in income from operations was partially offset   primarily by higher net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by higher average fixed account values as a result of positive net flows  . 

We provide information about this segment s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are   recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.  

See the Variable Account Value Information table within  Fee Income  below for drivers of changes in our variable account values   and the Fixed Account Value Information table within  Net Investment Income and Interest Credited  below for drivers of changes in our fixed account values.

See  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL   Unlocking  for more information about unlocking. 

Additional Information 

New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business.  Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations,   they   can significantly impact future income from operations  .  For the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,    31% and   2  8% of   our variable annuity deposits   were   on products without GLB riders  , respectively,   compared to   27  %     for the corresponding period  s   in   2015  .  As a result of   market uncertainty and low interest rates  , our variable annuity deposits for the three and   nine   months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   were significantly lower than the corresponding periods in 2015 resulting in negative net flows  . 

The other component of net flows   relates to the retention of the business.  An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of   full and partial   withdrawals to the average account values.  The overall lapse rate for our annuity products   was   7  %     and 6%   for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively  ,   compared to 7% for the corresponding periods in   2015  . 

Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges.  Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset.  We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.    For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Interest Rate Risk  herein and  Part II   Item 7A.

On April 8, 2016, the DOL released the final fiduciary advice regulation that provides for a phased implementation, the first of which will be effective April 10, 2017, with full implementation by January 1, 2018.    For information about regulatory risk including the potential impact of the DOL regulation, see  Department of Labor regulation defining fiduciary could cause changes to the manner in which we deliver products and services as well as changes in nature and   amount of compensation and fees      in  Item 1A.

Fee Income 

Details underlying   fee income  , account values and net flows (in millions) were as follows: 

(1) 

Excludes the fixed portion of variable.      

We charge contract holders mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses.  These assessments are a   function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values.  Average daily account values are driven by net flows and variable fund returns.  Charges on GLB riders are assessed based on a contractual rate that is applied either to the account value or the guaranteed amount.  In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their   contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.    Fee income   include  s   charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but excludes the attributed   fees   on our GLB   rider  s; see  Part II   Item 7.

A portion of our investment income earned is credited to the contract holders of our fixed annuity products, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts.  We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders  accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts.  Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

Benefits 

Details underlying benefits (in millions) were as follows: 

Benefits for this segment include changes in   income annuity reserves   driven by premiums, changes in benefit reserves and our expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our benefit ratio unlocking   on benefit reserves associated with our guaranteed death benefit riders.  For a corresponding offset of changes in income annuity reserves, see footnote 1 of  Income (Loss) from Operations  above. 

Commissions and Other Expenses  

Details underlying commissions and other expenses (in millions) were as follows: 

(1) 

Includes   reimbursements to Annuities from the Life Insurance segment for reserve financing, net of expenses incurred by Annuities for its use of letters of credit ( LOCs ).  The inter-segment amounts are not reported on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).     

58   

Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs.  C  ertain types of   commissions, such as trail commissions that a  re based on account values, are   expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized. 

Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized.  Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctua  tions in other revenues  . 

RESULTS OF RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES 

Inc    ome (Loss) from Operations 

Details underlying the results for Retirement Plan Services (in millions) were as follows: 

(1) 

Consists primarily of mutual fund account program revenues f  rom   mid to large employers.     

Comparison   of the Three Months Ended September 30  , 201  6   to 201  5 

Income from operations for this segment   decreased   due primarily to   the following: 

Higher     commissions and other expenses due to the effect of unlocking.     

Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven   by   spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields, partially offset by high  er average fixed account values and   prepayment and bond make-whole premiums  .     

Comparison of the   Nine   Months Ended   September   30, 2016 to 2015 

Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:   

Lower fee income driven by lower average daily variable account values as a result of lower average equity markets.     

Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven   by   spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields, partially offset by higher average fixed account values.     

We provide information about this segment s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

Additional Information 

Net flows in this business fluctuate based on the timing of larger plans being implemented on our platform and terminating over the course of the year. 

New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business.  Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.      The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business.  An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of   full and partial   withdrawals to the average account values.  The overall lapse rate for   the   business   was 12% for   the   three and     nine months   ended   September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015.   

Our net flows are   negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Account Value Roll Forward table below as    Multi-Fund    and Other   ), which are also our highest   margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with   low distribution and servicing costs  .  The proportion of these products to our total account values   was 29% and   30  % as   of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward   products with lower returns, an   increase in new deposit production continues to be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.       

Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on   either   a quarterly   or semi-annual   basis.  Our ability to retain quarterly   or semi-annual   reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset.  We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.  For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Interest Rate Risk  herein and  Item 7A.

Fee Income 

Details underlying fee income, account values and net flows (in millions) were as follows: 

\ 

60   

(1) 

Includes mutual fund account values and other third-party trustee-held assets.  These items are not included in the separate accounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we do not have any ownership interest in them.     

61   

(1) 

Excludes the fixed portion of variable.      

We charge expense assessments to cover insurance and administrative expenses.  Expense assessments are generally equal to a percentage of the daily variable account values.  Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets.  Our expense assessments include fees we earn for the services that we provide to our mutual fund programs.  In addition, for both our fixed and variable annuity contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.  

Net Investment Income and Interest Credited 

Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows: 

(1) 

See  Consolidated Investments   Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums  below for additional information.     

(2) 

Represents net investment income on the required statutory surplus for this segment and includes the effect of investment income on alternative investments for such assets that are held in the portfolios supporting statutory surplus versus the portfolios supporting product liabilities. 

62   

(1) 

Includes the fixed portion of variable.      

A portion of our investment income earned is credited to the contract holders of our fixed annuity products, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts.  We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders  accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts.  Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends. 

Benefits 

Benefits for this segment include changes in benefit reserves and our expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our benefit ratio unlocking. 

63   

Commissions and Other Expenses  

Details underlying commissions and other expenses (in millions) were as follows: 

Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs.  Certain types of commissions, such as trail commissions that are based on account values, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized.  Distribution expenses associated with the sale of mutual fund products are expensed as incurred.

RESULTS OF LIFE INSURANCE 

Inc    ome (Loss) from Operations 

Details underlying the results for Life Insurance (in millions) were as follows: 

(1) 

Includes term insurance premiums, which have a corresponding partial offset in benefits for changes in reserves.     

(2) 

See  Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking  below.        

Comparison of the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   to 2015 

Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to   the following: 

Low  er   commissions and other   expenses   due to     the effect of unlocking  .     

Lower benefits due to the effect of unlocking  .     

The increase in income from operations was partially offset by l  ower   fee income   due to the effect of unlocking. 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September   30, 2016 to 2015 

Income fro  m operations for this segment in  creased due primarily to   lower c  o  mmissions and other expenses   due to     the effect of unlocking, partially offset by   higher margins and amortization rates  . 

The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following: 

Higher benefits due to growth in business in force  , partially offset by the effect of unlocking.     

Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by less favorable investment income on alternative investments.     

We provide information about this segment s operating revenue and operating expense   line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.  

See  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL   Unlocking  for more information about unlocking.

65   

Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain 

Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and   risk-based capital (   RBC   )   levels above current regulatory required levels.  Term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees   require reserves calculated pursuant to the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation ( XXX ) and Actuarial Guideline 38 ( AG38 )  .  For information on strategies we use to reduce the   statutory reserve strain caused by XXX and AG38, see  Review of Consolidated Financial Condition   Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   Insurance Subsidiaries    Statutory Capital and Surplus  below. 

Additional Information 

Mortality was in line with our expectations during the third quarter of 2016.        Generally, we see lower claim counts in the second half of the year due to the effects of seasonality.

Risk Factors  in our   2015   Form 10-  K as updated by  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q.    

Insurance Premiums 

Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of   business   in force.    Business   in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.  

66   

Fee Income 

Details underlying fee income, sales, net flows, account values and in-force face amount (in millions) were as follows: 

Fee income relates only to interest-sensitive products and include  s     cost of insurance   assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to DFEL) and surrender charges.    Cost of insurance   and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders  account values.  These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values.    Business   in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.   

67   

Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant effect on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability.  Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest.   

Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows: 

MoneyGuard   ,   our linked-benefit product       15% of total expected premium deposits;     

UL, IUL and   VUL       first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50%   of commissionable premiums;     

Executive Benefits       single premium bank-owned UL and VUL, 15% of single premium deposits, and corporate owned UL and VUL, first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premium received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums; and     

Term   100% of annualized first year premiums.     

We monitor the business environment, including but not limited to the regulatory and interest rate environments, and make changes to our product offerings and inforce products as needed, and as permitted under the policies, to sustain the future profitabil  ity of our segment  .  We continue to focus on   maintaining our diversified   balance of life sales   across all   products  ,     with an emphasis on products   without long-term guarantees.  Individual   life sales without long-term guarantees were 63% and 66% for the   three     and nine months ended September 30  , 201  6, respectively, compared to 65% and 63% for the corresponding periods in 2015. 

Net Investment Income and Interest Credited 

Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows: 

(1) 

See  Consolidated Investments   Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums  below for additional information.     

(2) 

See  Consolidated Investments   Alternative Investments  below for additional information.     

(3) 

Represents net investment income on the required statutory surplus for this segment and includes the effect of investment income on alternative investments for such assets that are held in the portfolios supporting statutory surplus versus the portfolios supporting product liabilities.     

68   

A portion of the investment income earned for this segment is credited to contract holder accounts.  Statutory reserves will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements.  Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are affected by various reserve adjustments, including financing transactions providing relief   from AG38 reserve requirements.    These financing transactions lead to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations.  We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders  accounts.  We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated growth of our policy reserves for traditional products.  Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends. 

69   

Benefits 

Details underlying benefits (dollars in millions) were as follows: 

(1) 

Includes   primarily changes in reserves and dividends on traditional and other products.     

Benefits for this segment include claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products.  In addition, benefits include the change in secondary guarantee   and linked-benefit life insurance product reserves  .  The  se   reserve  s are   affected by changes in expected future trends of assessments   and benefits   caus  ing unlocking adjustments to these   liabilit  ies   similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL.    Generally, we have higher mortality in the first quarter of the year due to the seasonality of claims.    See  Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Funds  in Note 1 of our   2015   Form 10-K for additional information. 

70   

Commissions and Other Expenses 

Details underlying commissions and other expenses (in millions) were as follows: 

Commissions and costs that result directly from and are essential to successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and for our interest-sensitive products are generally amortized over the   life   of the contracts in relation to EGPs.  For our traditional products, DAC and VOBA are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts, depen  ding on the block of business.    When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage   of sales for the three and nine   months ended   September   30, 201  6  , to the corresponding periods in 201  5, the in  crease was primarily a result of changes in sales mix to products with   high  er commission rates. 

71   

RESULTS OF GROUP PROTECTION 

In    come (Loss) from Operations 

Details underlying the results for Group Protection (in millions) were as follows: 

Comparison of the Three   and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   to   2015 

Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to lower benefits driven by favorable   experience in all product lines and favorable   reserve refinements in our long-term disability business. 

The increase in income from operations was partially offset primarily by the following: 

Higher commissions and other expenses due to higher amortization of DAC driven by model refinements.     

Lower insurance premiums driven by re-pricing actions on our employer-paid life and disability business.     

We provide information about this segment s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are 

recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below. 

Additional Information 

Management compares trends in actual loss ratios to pricing expectations as group-underwriting risks change over time.  We expect normal fluctuations in our total non-medical loss ratio, as claims experience is inherently uncertain.  For every one percent increase in the total non-medical loss ratio, we would expect an approximate annual $12 million to $14 million decrease to income from operations.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, our total non-medical loss ratio of 60.1% and 67.4%, respectively, decreased from the prior periods due primarily to favorable reserve refinements and higher claim recoveries in our long-term disability business and favorable mortality in our life business.  Excluding the impact of the favorable reserve refinements, our total non-medical loss ratios for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were 70.2% and 70.7%, respectively.

Insurance Premiums 

Details underlying insurance premiums (in millions) were as follows: 

Our cost of insurance and policy administration charges are embedded in the premiums charged to our customers.  The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force.  Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience.   

Sales relate to   new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders.  We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time.  Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products.   

Net Investment Income 

We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated build of our reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets. 

73   

Benefits and Interest Credited 

Details underlying benefits and interest credited (in millions) and loss ratios by product line were as follows: 

Generally, we have higher mortality in the first quarter of the year due to the seasonality of claims. 

Commissions and Other Expenses  

Details underlying commissions and other expenses (in millions) were as follows: 

Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized in relation to the revenue  s   of the related contracts.  Certain broker commissions that vary with and are related to paid premiums are expensed as incurred.  The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for   this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.    Generally, we have higher amortization in the first quarter of the year due to a significant number of policies renewing in the quarter.    When comparing DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, to the corresponding periods in 2015, the increase was due to DAC model refinements.       

74   

RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS 

In    come (Loss) from Operations 

Details underlying the results for Other Operations (in millions) were as follows: 

(1) 

Includes our disability income business, which has a corresponding offset in benefits for changes in reserves.     

Comparison of the Three   Months Ended   September 30  , 201  6   to 201  5    

Loss from operations for Other Operations   decreased due primarily to the following  : 

Lower other expenses in 2016 due to lower legal expenses, partially offset by t  he effect of changes in our stock price on our deferred compensation plans, as our stock price   increased   significantly during   the third quarter of   2016 compared to a   significant decrease   during   the third quarter of   2015 (see  Other Expenses  below for more information).     

Higher tax benefits attributable to the release of reserves associated with prior tax years that closed in the third quarter of 2016.     

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 to 2015 

Loss from operations for Other Operations decreased due primarily   to the following  : 

The effect of changes in our stock price on our deferred compensation plans, as our stock price slightly decreased during 2016 compared to a significant decrease during 2015 (see  Other Expenses  below for more information).     

Higher tax benefits attributable to the release of reserves associated with prior tax years that closed in the third quarter of 2016.        

We provide information about Other Operations  operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below. 

Additional Information 

Benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were elevated due to modifying certain assumptions on the reserves supporting our run-off institutional pension business. 

For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see  Forward-Looking Statements   Cautionary Language  above and  Part I   Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our   2015   Form 10-  K as updated by  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q. 

75   

Net Investment Income and Interest Credited  

We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our   business   segments.  Investment income on capital in excess of   the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations.    If our   business   segments require increases in statutory reserves, surplus or investments, the amount of excess capital that is retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected. 

Write-downs for   OTTI   decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by the   business   segments.  These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our   business   segments.  When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the   business   segments  portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations.  Statutory reserve adjustments for our   business   segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the   business   segments and Other Operations. 

The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to   Swiss Re Life   Health America, Inc. (   Swiss Re   )   in 2001.  A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in our consolidated financial statements.  The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business.    There is no effect to income or   loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited. 

Benefits 

Benefits ar  e recognized when incurred for institutional p  ension products and disability income business. 

Other Expenses 

Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows: 

(1) 

Includes expenses that are corporate in nature including charitable contributions, the portion of our deferred compensation plan expense attributable to participants  selection of LNC stock as the measure for their investment return and other expenses not allocated to our   business   segments.     

(2) 

Consists of reimbursements to Other Operations from the Life Insurance segment for the use of proceeds from certain issuances of senior notes that were used as long-term structured solutions, net of expenses incurred by Other Operations for its use of LOCs.      

Interest and Debt Expense 

Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.  For additional information on our financing activities, see  Review of Consolidated Financial Condition   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   Financing Activities  below. 

76   

REALIZED GAIN (LOSS) AND BENEFIT RATIO UNLOCKING 

De    tails underlying realized gain (loss), after-DAC  (1)   and benefit ratio unlocking (in millions) were as follows:  

(1) 

DAC refers to the associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds and funds withheld reinsurance assets and liabilities.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 to 2015    

We had realized gains during 2016 as compared to losses during 2015 due primarily to the following: 

Gains on variable annuity net derivatives results during 2016 as compared to losses during 2015 attributable to the effect of unlocking and favorable hedge program performance due to less volatile capital markets, partially offset by an unfavorable GLB non-performance risk ( NPR ) component due to our associated reserves decreasing and narrowing of our credit spreads.     

Gains on indexed annuity forward-starting option driven primarily by a decrease in the cost of the options.     

77   

Comparison of the   Nine   Months Ended   September   30, 2016 to 2015  

We had lower realized losses during 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to the following: 

Gains on variable annuity net derivatives results during 2016 as compared to losses during 2015 attributable to less unfavorable hedge program performance due to less volatile capital markets, partially offset by a less favorable GLB NPR component due to a smaller increase in reserves.     

Lower losses on indexed annuity forward-starting option primarily driven by a decrease in the cost of the options.     

Lower losses on the mark-to-market on certain instruments attributable to a decrease in interest rates leading to an increase in the value of our trading securities.     

The lower realized losses were partially offset by the following: 

An increase in OTTI attributable to the impact of continued stress in the energy and other commodity sectors and other individual credit risks within our corporate bond holdings.     

Higher legal expenses related to certain investments.     

The above components of excluded realized gain (loss) are described net of benefit ratio unlocking, after-tax.

CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS 

Det    ails underlying our consolidated investment balances (in millions) were as follows: 

Investment Objective 

I  nvested assets are an integral p  art of our operations. We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities.  This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives.  This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities.      For a discussion o  f   our risk management process, see  Part II   Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in our   2015 F  orm 10-K. 

Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification 

Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments.  We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.   

We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.  

79   

Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios 

Fixed maturity   and equity securities consist of portfolios   classified as AFS and trading.    Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are   presented in the tables below.    These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note   4  ; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio.  Therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note   4  . 

80   

(1) 

Certain   of our   trading securities support our modified coinsurance arrangements ( Modco ), and the investment results are passed directly to the reinsurers.  Refer to  Part II   Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Consolidated Investments   Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios   Trading Securities  in our   2015   Form 10-K for further details.      

(2) 

I  ncludes unrealized gains and (losses) on impaired securities related to changes in the   fair   value of such securities subsequent to the impairment measurement date.     

81   

AFS Securities 

In accordance with the AFS accounting guidance, we reflect stockholders  equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical   recognition of unrealized gains   and losses.  Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, future contract benefits, other     contract holder funds and deferred income taxes.  Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other com  prehensive income (loss)  .  For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business.  Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.   

The quality of our AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity AFS securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows: 

(1) 

Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the   National Association of Insurance Commissioners (   NAIC   )   or the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings ( Fitch ), Moody s Investors Service ( Moody s ) and Standard   Poor s ( S P )).      For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit   rating   agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used.      For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings d  isclosed upon internal   ratings. The average credit quality was   A-   as of September   30, 2016.       

Comparisons between the NAIC ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC.  The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements.  The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds.  NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rat  ed Baa3 or higher by Moody s, or   rated BBB- or higher by   S P and Fitch  ) by such ratings organizations.  However, securities rated NAI  C 1 and   2 could be deemed below investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ) and CMBS for statutory reporting.  NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment g  rade (rated Ba   or lower by Moody s, or rated BB+ or lower by S P and Fitch).  

As of September   30, 2016, and December 31, 201  5  ,    71.7%   and 91  .8  %,   respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade.  Our gross unrealized   losses,   including the portion of OTTI recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ),   on AFS securities as of   September 30, 2016  ,    decreased by $1.  6   billion   since December 31, 2015  .  As more fully described in Note 1 in our 201  5   Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI.  We believe the unrealized loss position as   of   September 30, 2016  , does not represent OTTI as  :    (i) we do not intend to sell the debt securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities bef  ore recovery of their amortized cost; (iii) the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost of the debt securities  ; and (iv) we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery.  For further information on our unrealized losses on AFS securities  ,   see  Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities  below. 

82   

As the energy markets continue to experience distress and future uncertainty, we also consider our related exposure in the context of the following industry categories and associated credit quality: 

(1) 

Does not   include the amortized cost, unrealized gain (loss) and fair value of trading securities   totaling $122 million, $18 million   and   $140 million  , respectively.           

83   

(2) 

Does not include the   amortized cost, unrealized gain (loss) and fair value of trading securities totaling $137 million, $6 million and $143 million, respectively  .       

We concluded  :     (i)   that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recover  y of   their amortized cost; (ii) that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost of the   debt securities;   and   (iii)   that we have the ability to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery.  This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process.  Management considers the following as part of the evaluation: 

The current economic environment and market conditions;     

Our business strategy and current business plans;     

The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;     

Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;     

The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;     

The capital risk limits approved by management; and     

Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.     

To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following: 

Historical and implied volatility of the security;     

Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less   than amortized cost;      

Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;      

Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and     

Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.      

As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we   had $115.0 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $94.7 billion as of September 30, 2016.  If it were necessary to liquidate investments prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to AFS securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $85.6 billion, excluding consolidated VIEs in the amount of $600 million, as of September 30, 2016, rather than selling securities in an unrealized loss position.  The amount of cash that we have on hand takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the ongoing cash flows from new and existing business.   

See  AFS Securities   Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost  in Note 1 in our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 4 herein for additional discussion. 

As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value for all private placement securities was $14.6 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively, representing 13%   and 14%   of total   invested assets  , respectively  . 

For information regarding our VIEs  fixed maturity securities, see   Note 4   in our   2015 Form   10-K and     Note   3     herein  .

Mortgage-Backed Securities (Included in AFS and Trading Securities) 

See    Part II   Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Consolidated Investments   Mortgage-Backed   Securities  in our 2015 Form 10-K for a discussion   of our   mortgage-backed securities     (   MBS   )  .   

Our   ABS home equity and   RMBS had a market   value of $4.5 billion and an unrealized gain of $219 million, or 5%, as of September   30, 2016  .       

The market value of   AFS securities and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $586 million and represented approximately 1% of our total investment portfolio as of September 30, 2016.  AFS securities represented $578 million, or 99%, and trading securities represented $8 million, or 1%, of the subprime exposure as of September   30, 2016.  The table below summarizes our investments in AFS securities backed by pools of residential   mortgages (in millions) as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 

Includes the fair value and amortized cost of option adjustable rate mortgages ( ARM ) within RMBS, totaling $317 million and $327 million, respectively.     

(2) 

Does not include the fair value of trading securities totaling $118 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers.  The $118 million in trading securities consisted of $105 million prime, $5 million Alt-A and $8 million subprime.      

(3) 

Does not include the amortized cost of trading securities totaling $111 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers.  The $111 million in trading securities consisted of $98 million prime, $5 million Alt-A and $8 million subprime.       

(4) 

Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the major credit rating agencies (Fitch, Moody s and S P).  For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used.  For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not   available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.      

None of these investments included any direct investments in subprime lenders or mortgages.  We are not aware of material exposure to subprime loans in our alternative asset portfolio. 

85   

The following summarizes our investments in AFS securities backed by pools of commercial mortgages (in millions) as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 

Does not include the fair value of trading   securities totaling $2 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers.  The $2 million in trading securities consisted entirely of CMBS.       

(2) 

Does not include the amortized cost of trading securities totaling $2 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers.  The $2 million in trading   securities consisted entirely of CMBS.       

(3) 

Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the major credit rating agencies (Fitch, Moody s and S P).  For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used.  For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.       

As of September 30, 2016, the fair value and amortized cost of our AFS exposure to Monoline insurers was $506 million and $462 million, respectively.       

Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities 

When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date.  Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios.  These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential effect of   securities in an unrealized loss position   on our future earnings.   

86   

The composition by industry categories of all secu  rities in an unrealized loss position   (in millions) as of   September 30, 2016  , was as follows: 

As of   September   30, 2016, the fair value and amortized cost of securities subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized loss position   was $281 million and $323 million, respectively  .    

Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 

The following tables summarize key information on mortgage loans on real estate (in millions): 

87   

As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31,   2015, there     were   three   impaired mortgage loans on real estate, or less   than 1%   of the total dollar amount of mortgage loans on real estate.  The total principal and interest   past due on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of   September 30, 2016  ,   and December 31, 2015,   was $7 million and $0, respectively  .    See Note 1 in our   2015 Form   10-K for more information regarding our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans on real estate. 

See Note   4   for information regarding our loan-to-value a  nd debt-service coverage ratios and our allowance for loan losses. 

88   

Alternative Investments 

Investment income (loss) on alternative investments by business segment (in millions) was as follows: 

(1) 

Includes net investment income on the alternative investments supporting the required statutory surplus of our insurance businesses.     

As of   September 30, 2016  , and December 31,   2015, alternative investments included investments   in 198 and   190 different partnerships, respectively, and   the portfolio represented   approximately 1% of   our overall invested assets.    The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners.  Some of   our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner.  These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date.  The capital calls are not material in size and   are not material to   our liquidity.  Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Non-Income Producing Investments 

T  he carrying   amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that wer  e non-income producing as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, were $9 million   and $13 million, respectively  .   

Net Investment Income 

Details underlying net investment income (in millions) and our investment yield were as follows: 

(1) 

See  Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums  below for additional information.     

(2) 

See  Alternative Investments  above for additional information.     

89   

We earn investment income on our general account assets supporting fixed annuity, term life, whole life, UL, interest-sensitive whole life and   the   fixed portion of retirement plan and VUL products.  The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable.  Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments.  These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends. 

Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums 

Prepayment and make-whole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity.  A prepayment or make-whole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity.  These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment. 

Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments 

D  etail  s   of the realized gain (loss) related to certa  in investments (in millions) were   as follows: 

(1) 

These amounts are represented net of related fair value hedging activity.  See Note 5 for more information.     

Amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflect an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses.      When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized   losses   reflecting the incremental effect of actual  

90   

versus expected credit-related investment losses.  These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create   volatility in net realized gains and losses  .  The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest     rate  -  related impairments. 

Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience.  During the first   nine     months of 2016 and 2015, we sold securities   for gains and losses.    In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the securit  y prior to a recovery of value.        However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and   overall portfolio maintenance.    Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell.  These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS.  We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.  

We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers.  While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management   strategy   has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio.  Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks.  The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties. 

When the detailed analysis by our external asset managers and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value.  In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored.  See    Part II   Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Introduction     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     Investments   Write-downs for OTTI and Allowance for Losses    in   our 2015 Form   10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy. 

Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTI (in millions) were as follows: 

The $128 million of impairments taken during the first nine months of 2016 were split between $79 million of credit-related impairments and $49 million of noncredit-related impairments.      The increase in write-downs for OTTI when comparing the first nine months of 2016 to the corresponding period in 2015   was primarily attributable to certain corporate bond holdings within the energy and other commodity sectors that experienced deteriorating fundamentals.      The   noncredit-related impairments were   due     primarily   to declines in values of securities for which we do not have an intent to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery.

RE    VIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Liquidi    ty and Capital Resources 

Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow 

Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements wi  th a prudent margin of safety.    Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities   and sales of invested assets.    Our oper  ating activities provided   cash   of   $677   million   an  d   $1.5 billion   for   the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC.  As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.   

The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement.  These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses.   

Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows: 

The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below).  Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company.  Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.    For information regarding limits on the dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay, see  Part II   Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Review of Consolidated Financial Condition   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Restrictions on Dividends from Subsidiaries  in our 2015 Form 10-K.       

Insurance   Subsidiaries  Statutory   Capital   and Surplus 

Our regulatory capital levels are also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator.  Our term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to XXX and AG38, respectively.  During the third quarter of 2013, the New York State Department of Financial Services announced that it would not recognize the NAIC revisions to AG38 in applying the New York law governing the reserves to be held for UL and VUL products containing secondary guarantees.  The change, which was effective as of December 31, 2013, impacted   the Lincoln Life   Annuity Company of New York (   LLANY   )  .  Although LLANY discontinued the sale of these products in early 2013, the change affected those policies previously sold.  We began phasing in the   increase in reserves in   2013   at $  90   million per year over five years  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have increased reserves by   $  270   million  .  In April 2016, LLANY entered into a third-party reinsurance arrangement primarily covering UL policies containing secondary guarantees issued between 2002 through 2014 that mitigates the financial impact of the increase of the aforementioned reserves. 

As discussed in  Part I   Item 1. Risk Factors   Legislative, Regulatory, and Tax   Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operations,  our insurance subsidiaries employ strategies to reduce the strain caused by XXX and AG38 by reinsuring the business to insurance captives.  Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries provide a mechanism for financing a portion of the excess reserve

amounts in a more efficient manner.  We use long-dated LOCs and debt financing as well as other financing strategies to finance those reserves.  Included in the LOCs issued as of   September 30, 2016  , was approximately   $  3.4   billion   of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance arrangements.  Approximately   $  2.3   billion   of such LOCs were issued to support reinsurance for UL products containing secondary guarantees   (  $  350   million   will expire in 2019  ,    $  1   million   will expire in   2021   and   $  1.9   billion   will expire in 2031), and   $  1.1   billion   of such LOCs that will expire in 2023 were issued to support reinsurance for term business.  We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of   $  875   million   to execute long-term structured solutions supporting reinsurance of UL products containing secondary guarantees.  Additionally, our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have issued long-term notes of   $  1.7     billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , to finance a portion of the excess reserves.  For information on these long-term notes issued by our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, see   Note 4   in our 2015 Form 10-K  .  LOCs and related capital market solutions lower the capital effect of term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees.      An inability to obtain appropriate capital market solutions could affect our returns on our in-force term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees.  However, we believe that we have sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves, based on our current reserve projections, if such structures were no longer available. 

Our captive reinsurance subsidiaries free up capital the insurance subsidiaries can use for any number of purposes, including paying dividends to the holding company.  Once transferred to the holding company, it can deploy this capital for a variety of corporate   purposes, including potential   stock repurchases.  Actuarial Guideline 48 ( AG48 ) regulates the terms of captive reinsurance arrangements that are entered into or amended in certain ways after December 31, 2014.  AG48 imposes restrictions on the types of assets that can be used to support these arrangements.  We   have implemented and plan to continue to   implement these arrangements in compliance with AG48. 

Statutory reserves established for variable annuity contracts and riders are sensitive to changes in the equity markets and are affected by the level of account values relative to the level of any guarantees, product design and reinsurance arrangements.  As a result, the relationship between reserve changes and equity market performance is non-linear during any given reporting period.  Market conditions greatly influence the ultimate capital required due to its effect on the valuation of reserves and derivative assets hedging these reserves.  We also utilize inter-company reinsurance arrangements to manage our hedge program for variable annuity guarantees.  The NAIC through its various committees, task forces and working groups has been studying the use of captives and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk and has been evaluating the adequacy of existing NAIC model laws and regulations applicable to annuity captives. 

We continue to analyze the use of our existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, and our current hedging strategies relative to managing the effects of equity markets and interest rates on the statutory reserves, statutory capital and the dividend capacity of our life insurance subsidiaries. 

Financing Activities 

Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.   

We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase   contracts, stock purchase units and   depository shares.   

Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions)   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,   were as follows: 

(1) 

Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper,   non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion   (amortization) of discounts and   premiums   and amortization of debt issuance costs,   as applicable.     

(2) 

As of September 30, 2016, our primary insurance subsidiary, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, had short-term debt that consisted of a $  250   million floating rate note maturing on June 20, 2017.     

93   

As of   September 30, 2016  , the holding company had available liquidity of   $  546   million  .  Available   liquidity consists of cash and invested cash, excluding cash held as collateral, and certain short-term investments that can be readily converted into cash, net of commercial paper outstanding.  

Effective as of June 30, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks.  This agreement (the  credit facility ) allows for the issuance of LOCs of up to $  2.5 billion   and borrowing of up to $  2.5 billion, $1.75   billion of which is available only to reimburse the banks for drawn LOCs.  The credit facility is unsecured and has a commitment termination date of June 30, 2021.  LOCs under the facility are used primarily to satisfy reserve credit requirements of (i) our domestic insurance companies for which reserve credit is provided by our affiliated reinsurance companies and (ii) certain ceding companies of our legacy reinsurance business. 

The credit facility contains or includes: 

Customary terms and conditions, including covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;     

Financial covenants including maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth (as defined in the facility) equal to the sum of   $10.5   billion plus   50  % of the aggregate net proceeds of equity issuances received by us in accordance with the terms of the credit facility; and a debt-to-capital ratio as defined in accordance with the credit facility not to exceed   0.35 to 1.00  ; and      

Customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods for certain of those events of default.     

Upon an event of default, the credit facility provides that, among other things, the commitments may be terminated and the loans then outstanding may be declared due and payable.  As of   September   30, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants. 

For more information about our short-term and long-term debt and our credit facilities and LOCs, see Note 12 in our   2015   Form 10-K. 

We have not accounted for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets as sales.  For information about our collateralized financing transactions on our investments, see  Payables for Collateral on Investments  in Note   4  . 

If current credit ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity.    For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should the long-term senior debt ratings of LNC drop below   BBB-/Baa3   (S P/Moody s).    Our long-term senior debt held a rating of   A-/Baa1   (S P/Moody s) as of   September 30, 2016  .  In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products.    See  Part I   Item 1A. Risk   Factors   Liquidity and Capital Position   A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings    and  Part I   Item 1A. Risk Factors       Coven  ants and Ratings   A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors  in our   201  5   Form 10-K for more information.  See    Part I   Item 1  . Business   Financial Strength Ratings  in our   201  5   Form 10-K for additional   information on our current   financial strength ratings. 

See  Part II   Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and   Results of Operations   Review of Consolidated Financial Condition   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Financing Activities  in our   201  5   Form   10-K for information on our credit ratings. 

Alternative Sources of Liquidity 

In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs.  The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans   between   LNC and   participating     subsidiaries   that reduce  s   overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal   resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the holding company had a net outstanding   payable   of   $  311   million   to   certain   subsidiaries resulting from   loans made by subsidiaries in excess of amounts borrowed by the holding company and subsidiaries   in the inter-company cash management   account  .  Any   change in holding company cash management program balances is offset by the immediate and equal change in holding company cash and   invested   cash.  Loans under the cash management program are permitted under applicable insurance laws subject to certain restrictions.  For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently   3  %   of the insurance company s admitted assets as of its most recent year end.  For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than   2  %   of its admitted assets as of the last year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC. 

Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue   of their general account fixed-  income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities   lending programs and repurchase agreements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our insurance subsidiaries had investments with a carrying value of   $  3.3     billion   out on loan or subject to repurchase agreements.  The cash received in our securities lending programs and repurchase agreements is   typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities.  For additional details, see  Payables for Collateral on Investments  in Note   4  . 

94   

Cash Flows from Collateral on Derivatives 

Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes.  As the value of a derivative asset   decreases   (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also   decrease   (or increase).  Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability   decreases   (or increases), the collateral we are required to post   to our counterparties   would als  o decrease (or increase).    During the   nine   months ended   September 30  ,    2016  , our payables for collateral on derivative   investments increased by $  994 million   due primarily to   decreasing interest rates that increased   the fair values of our associated derivative investments  .    In the event of adverse changes in fair value   of our derivative instruments, we may need to post collateral with a counterparty if our net derivative liability position reaches certain contractual levels.  If we do not have sufficient high quality securities or cash and invested cash to provide as collateral, we have multiple liquidity sources to leverage that would be eligible for collateral posting.        For additional information, see  Credit Risk  in Note   5  . 

Divestitures 

For   a discussion of   our divestitures, see Note   3 in our 2015 Form 10-  K  . 

Uses of Capital 

Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders  ,   to repurchase our stock and   to repay   debt.  

Return of Capital to Common Stockholders  

One of the Company s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases.  In determining dividends, the Board of Directors takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility.  The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital.  Free cash flow for the holding company generally represents the amount of dividends and interest received from subsidiaries less interest paid on debt. 

Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data), were as follows: 

On November 1, 2016, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.25 to $0.29 per share.    Additionally, we expect to repurchase additional shares of common stock during   the remainder of 2016   depending on market conditions and alternative uses of capital.  For more information regarding share repurchases, see  Part II   Item 2(c)  below. 

95   

Other Uses of Capital 

In addition to the amounts in the table above in  Return of Capital to Common Stockholders,  other uses of holding company cash flow (in millions) were as follows: 

The above table focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management account.  Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company. 

Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow 

As stated above, LNC s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries  RBC and statutory earnings performance.  We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption.  A decline in capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries  statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries  dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital.  For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see  Part I   Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our   201  5   Form 10-K     as updated by    Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q  .

OTHE    R MATTERS 

Other     Factors Affecting Our Business 

In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment.  Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries.  Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.  For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see  Part I   Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our   2015     Form 10-K as updated by  Item 1A.

See Note 2 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future. 

Item 3.          Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-lia  bility management process that considers   diversification.  By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value.  We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, default risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk.  The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management processes, are most important to our business where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products.  As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management processes, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility.  In this context, derivatives serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings.  Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions.  Our pri  mary sources of market risk are   substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates or a sharp drop in equity market values.  These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated  

96   

financial statements presented in    Item 1. Financial Statements,  as well as  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and   Results of Operations.  

Interest Rate Risk     

Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity 

For information about the effect of interest rate sensitivity on our income (loss) from operations  , see    Part II   Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Interest Rate Risk         Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity       in our   2015 Form 10-K. 

Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insu  rance Businesses  

In periods of low   interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments.  Moreo  ver, borrowers may prepay fixed-  income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general accounts in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk.  Because we are entitled to reset   the interest rates on our fixed-  rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.   

Prolonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals.  However  , we have recognized this risk   and have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment.  For some time now, new products have been sold with low minimum crediting floors, and we apply disciplined asset-liability management standards, such as locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue.        See  Part I   Item 1A. Risk Factors   Market Conditions   Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals    in our 2015 Form 10-K   for addition  al information on interest rate risks  . 

The following provides detail on the percentage differences between the   September 30, 2016  , interest rates being credited to cont  ract holders based on the third quarter of   2016     declared rates and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within our segments: 

(1) 

Excludes policy loans.     

(2) 

Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary.     

(3) 

The average crediting rates   wer  e    45   basis po  ints  ,    6   basis p  oints   a  nd   6   basis p  oints in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services and Life Insurance segments, respectively.     

(4) 

The average cred  iting rates were   98   basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates.  Of our account values for these products:   24  %   are scheduled to reset in more than one year but not more than two years;   21  %   are scheduled to reset in more than two years but not more than three years; and   55  %   are scheduled t  o reset in more than three years.      

(5) 

For Annuities, this amount relates primarily to   income   annuity and short-term dollar cost averaging business.  For Retirement Plan Services, this amount relates   primarily   to indexed-based rate setting products in which the average crediting rates   w  er  e    14   basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates   and   76  %    o  f acco  unt   values were already at their minimum guaranteed   rates.     

97   

The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates.  We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios.  We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio. 

Derivatives 

See Note   5    for information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. 

Equity Market Risk 

Our revenues, ass  ets and   liabilities are exposed to equity market risk   that we often hedge with derivatives  .  Due to the use of our   RTM   process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking   of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, DSI, and DFEL  .  However, earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets.  Refer to    Part II     Item 7.

Credit   Risk 

We   may   use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events  ,   and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors.   

In addition to the information provided about our counterparty exposure in Note   5  , the fair value of our exposure by rating (in millions) was as follows: 

See Note   5 for     additional   information   on our credit risk  .   

Item 4.          Controls and Procedures 

Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.      As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act).  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act. 

98   

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system s objectives will be met.  Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.  Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.  Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Item 2  .      Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

(c)    The following table summarizes purchases of equity securities by the   Company   during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   (dollars in millions, except per share data):   

(1) 

Of the total number of shares purchased, no shares were received in connection with the exercise of stock options and related taxes.  For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , there   were 4,318,438 shares   purchased   as part of publicly announced plans or programs.       

(2) 

On May 26  , 201  6  , our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our securities repurchase authorization, bringing the total aggregate repurchase authorization to $1.0 billion.  As of September 30, 2016, our remaining security repurchase authorization was $691 million.  The security repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date.  The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital   ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits   associated with alternative uses of capital.
