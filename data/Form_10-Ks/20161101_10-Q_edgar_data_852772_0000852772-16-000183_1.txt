Note 1.     Introduction and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Denny s Corporation, or Denny s, is one of America s largest full-service restaurant chains based on number of restaurants. At   September 28, 2016  , the Denny's brand consisted of   1,728   restaurants,   1,560   of which were franchised/licensed restaurants and   168   of which were company operated.  
    
  Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, certain information and notes normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. In our opinion, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods presented have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions; however, we believe that our estimates, including those for the above-described items, are reasonable. 
    
  These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 30, 2015   and the related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, both of which are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 30, 2015  . The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year ending   December 28, 2016  . 

Note 2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Newly Adopted Accounting Standards 
    
  Consolidation 
    
  ASU 2015-02,"Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis" 
    
  Effective December 31, 2015, we adopted ASU 2015-02, which improves targeted areas of the consolidation guidance and reduces the number of consolidation models. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Debt Issuance 
    
  ASU 2015-03,"Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" and ASU 2015-15,"Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting  (SEC Update)" 
    
  Effective December 31, 2015, we adopted ASU 2015-03, which simplifies the guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs. The new guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction of the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Also effective December 31, 2015, we adopted ASU 2015-15, which addresses the SEC's comments related to the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 related to line-of-credit arrangements. According to this guidance, the SEC will not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements and we will continue to classify debt issuance costs as an asset.  

8 

Intangibles 
    
  ASU 2015-05,"Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement" 
    
  Effective December 31, 2015, we adopted, on a prospective basis, ASU 2015-05, which provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a software license is included, the customer should account for the license consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a software license is not included, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Inventory 
    
  ASU 2015-11,"Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory" 
    
  Effective December 31, 2015, we adopted ASU 2015-11, which requires inventory that is measured using the first-in, first-out method to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Derivatives 
    
  ASU 2016-05,"Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)" 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05, which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. We early adopted this guidance as of March 30, 2016 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Accounting Standards to be Adopted 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
  ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)", 
  ASU 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date", 
  ASU 2016-08, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net", 
  ASU 2016-10, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing" and 
  ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients" 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which clarifies the principles used to recognize revenue for all entities. The new guidance requires companies to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or service to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date for ASU 2014-09. The guidance is now effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (our fiscal 2018). The guidance allows for either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  
  
   9 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, which clarifies the implementation guidance provided in ASU 2014-09 on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, which clarifies the implementation guidance in ASU 2014-09 on licensing and identifying performance obligations. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, which provides clarifying guidance and adds some practical expedients in the areas of assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes received from customers, noncash consideration, contract modification and clarification of using the full retrospective approach to adopt ASU 2014-09. These three new ASUs must be adopted concurrently with ASU 2014-09. The guidance is not expected to impact the recognition of company restaurant sales or royalties from franchised restaurants. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the recognition of other transactions on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and have not yet selected a transition method. 
    
  Financial Instruments 
    
  ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (our fiscal 2018) with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform financial statement users of credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 (our fiscal 2020) with early adoption permitted for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (our fiscal 2019). We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Leases 
    
  ASU 2016-02,"Leases (Topic 842)" 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which provides guidance for accounting for leases. The new guidance requires companies to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased assets. The accounting guidance for lessors is largely unchanged. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (our fiscal 2019) with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, but expect the adoption will result in a significant increase in the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. 

10 

Stock Compensation 
    
  ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, an accounting policy election for forfeitures, the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (our fiscal 2017) with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered in this update. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Statement of Cash Flows 
    
  ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)" 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (our fiscal 2018) with early adoption permitted. The guidance is to be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  We reviewed all other newly issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they are either not applicable to our business or are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements as a result of future adoption. 

Note 3.     Receivables 
    
  Receivables were comprised of the following: 

11 

Note 4.    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
  The following table reflects the changes in carrying amounts of goodwill. 

Other intangible assets were comprised of the following: 

During the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  , we acquired   nine   franchised restaurants for   $12.4 million  , of which   $8.5 million   was allocated to reacquired franchise rights,   $2.0 million   to property and   $1.8 million   to goodwill. The   $8.5 million   decrease in gross franchise and license agreements during the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016   primarily resulted from the removal of fully amortized agreements.  

Note 5.     Other Current Liabilities 
    
  Other current liabilities consisted of the following: 

12 

Note 6.     Operating (Gains), Losses and Other Charges, Net 
    
  Operating (gains), losses and other charges, net     are comprised of the following: 

The pre-tax pension settlement loss of   $24.3 million   related to the completion of the Pension Plan liquidation during the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  . See Note 9 for details on the Pension Plan liquidation. Gains on sales of assets and other, net of   $0.8 million   for the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016   primarily related to restaurants sold to franchisees. 
    
  Restructuring charges and exit costs were comprised of the following:  

The components of the change in accrued exit cost liabilities are as follows: 

(1) 
    Included as a component of operating (gains), losses and other charges, net. 
       
  As of   September 28, 2016   and   December 30, 2015  , we had accrued severance and other restructuring charges of   $0.3 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively. The balance as of   September 28, 2016   is expected to be paid during the next 12 months. 
    
  Impairment charges of   $0.7 million   for the three quarters ended September 30, 2015 resulted primarily from the impairment of a restaurant identified as assets held for sale. 

13 

Note 7.     Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring and Nonrecurring Basis 
    
  Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below: 

(1) 
    The fair values of our deferred compensation plan investments are based on the closing market prices of the elected investments. 
              (2) 
    The fair values of our interest rate swaps are based upon Level 2 inputs, which include valuation models as reported by our counterparties. The key inputs for the valuation models are quoted market prices, interest rates and forward yield curves. See Note 8 for details on the interest rate swaps. 
       
  Those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are summarized below:

Note 8.     Long-Term Debt 
    
  Denny's Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries have a credit facility consisting of a five-year   $325 million   senior secured revolver (with a   $30 million   letter of credit sublimit). As of   September 28, 2016  , we had outstanding revolver loans of   $203.0 million   and outstanding letters of credit under the senior secured revolver of   $22.4 million  . These balances resulted in availability of   $99.6 million   under the revolving facility. Prior to considering the impact of our interest rate swaps, described below, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding revolver loans was   2.28%   and   1.76%   as of   September 28, 2016   and   December 30, 2015  , respectively. Taking into consideration our interest rate swaps, the weighted-average interest rate of outstanding revolver loans was   2.63%   and   2.31%   as of   September 28, 2016   and   December 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  A commitment fee of   0.25%   is paid on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the credit facility bear a tiered interest rate, which is based on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio and was set at LIBOR plus 175 basis points as of   September 28, 2016  . The maturity date for the credit facility is   March 30, 2020  . 
  
   14 

The credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The credit facility is guaranteed by the Company and its material subsidiaries and is secured by assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the stock of the Company's subsidiaries. It includes negative covenants that are usual for facilities and transactions of this type. The credit facility also includes certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. 
    
  Interest Rate Hedges 
  We have interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our floating rate debt. We designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to payments of LIBOR due on specific notional debt obligations. 
    
  Based on the interest rate as determined by our consolidated leverage ratio in effect as of   September 28, 2016  , under the terms of the swaps, we will pay the following fixed rates on the notional amounts noted: 

As of   September 28, 2016  , the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of   $14.6 million  , which is recorded as a component of other noncurrent liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 14 for the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the interest rate swaps. 
    
  We believe that our estimated cash flows from operations for   2016  , combined with our capacity for additional borrowings under our credit facility, will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements and fund capital expenditures over the next twelve months. 

Note 9.     Defined Benefit Plans 
    
  The components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows: 

15 

During 2014, our Board of Directors approved the termination and liquidation of the Advantica Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan") as of December 31, 2014. During the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  , we completed the liquidation of the Pension Plan. Accordingly, we made a final contribution of   $9.5 million   to the Pension Plan. The resulting   $67.7 million   in Pension Plan assets were used to make lump sum payments and purchase annuity contracts, which are administered by a third-party provider. In addition, during the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  , we recognized a pre-tax settlement loss of   $24.3 million   related to the liquidation, reflecting the recognition of unamortized actuarial losses that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 14. We made   no   contributions to the Pension Plan during the   three quarters   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  We made contributions of   $0.1 million   to our other defined benefit plans during both the   three quarters   ended   September 28, 2016   and the   three quarters   ended   September 30, 2015  . We expect to contribute less than   $0.1 million   to our other defined benefit plans over the remainder of fiscal   2016  .  
    
  Additional minimum pension liability, net of tax, of   $0.9 million   and   $22.8 million   is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders  Equity as of   September 28, 2016   and   December 30, 2015  , respectively. 

Note 10.     Share-Based Compensation 
    
  Total share-based compensation cost included as a component of net income was as follows: 

Performance Share Awards 
    
  In February 2016, we granted certain employees approximately   0.3 million   performance shares that vest based on the total shareholder return ("TSR") of our common stock compared to the TSRs of a group of peer companies and   0.3 million   performance shares that vest based on our Adjusted EBITDA growth rate, as defined under the terms of the award. As the TSR based performance shares contain a market condition, a Monte Carlo valuation was used to determine the grant date fair value of   $9.43   per share. The performance shares based on the Adjusted EBITDA growth rate have a grant date fair value of   $9.52   per share, the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The awards granted to our named executive officers also contain a performance condition based on the attainment of an operating measure for the fiscal year ended   December 28, 2016  . The performance period for these performance shares is the   three   year fiscal period beginning December 31, 2015 and ending December 26, 2018. They will vest and be earned (from   0%   to   150%   of the target award for each such increment) at the end of the performance period. 
    
  During the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  , we made payments of   $2.5 million   in cash and issued   0.4 million   shares of common stock related to performance share awards. 
    
  As of   September 28, 2016  , we had approximately   $8.6 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to all unvested performance share awards outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of   1.8 years  . 

16 

Restricted Stock Units for Board Members 
    
  During the quarter ended June 29, 2016, we granted approximately   0.1 million   deferred stock units (DSUs) (which are equity classified) with a weighted average grant date fair value of   $10.77   per unit to non-employee members of our Board of Directors. A director may elect to convert these awards into shares of common stock either on a specific date in the future (while still serving as a member of our Board of Directors) or upon termination as a member of our Board of Directors. During the quarter ended September 28, 2016 these awards were subsequently canceled and rescinded and replacement awards were issued. Directors who had previously elected a   one  -year conversion of the 2016 award received a replacement cash award. The total replacement cash award was   $0.5 million   and is liability classified. Directors who had previously elected conversion of the 2016 award at a later date received a replacement DSU award, which is equity classified and has a   three   year vesting term. The total replacement DSU award was less than   0.1 million   DSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value of   $10.77   per unit. During the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  , less than   0.1 million   DSUs were converted into shares of common stock. As of   September 28, 2016  , we had approximately   $0.3 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to all unvested restricted stock unit awards outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of   2.6 years  .  

Note 11.     Income Taxes 
    
  The effective tax rate was   35.2%   for the quarter and   64.2%   year-to-date compared to   30.1%   and   34.0%  , respectively, for the prior year periods. For the 2016 periods, the difference in the overall effective rate from the U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to the Pension Plan liquidation, foreign tax credits and certain discrete items. During the three quarters ended September 28, 2016, we amended prior years  U.S. tax returns in order to maximize a foreign tax credit in lieu of a foreign tax deduction. This created a benefit to the effective tax rate of   4.8%   for the quarter and   4.6%   year-to-date. In addition, during the three quarters ended September 28, 2016, certain discrete items created an increase to the effective tax rate of   4.3%   for the quarter and   4.7%   year-to-date.    
    
  In addition to the items noted above, the 2016 year-to-date rate was also impacted by the recognition of a   $2.1 million   tax benefit related to the   $24.3 million   pre-tax settlement loss on the Pension Plan liquidation. This benefit was at a rate lower than the effective tax rate due to the previous recognition of an approximate   $7.2 million   tax benefit in connection with the reversal of our valuation allowance in 2011. Excluding the impact of the Pension Plan liquidation, our effective income tax rate would have been   35.6%   for the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  .

Note 13.     Supplemental Cash Flow Information 

Note 14.     Shareholders' Equity 
    
  Share Repurchase 
    
  Our credit facility permits the purchase of Denny s stock and the payment of cash dividends subject to certain limitations. In March 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to   $100 million   of our common stock (in addition to prior authorizations). Under this program, we may, from time to time, purchase shares in the open market (including pre-arranged stock trading plans in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to market and business conditions.  
    
  In May 2016, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase an additional   $100 million   of our common stock, in addition to repurchases previously authorized. Such repurchases are to be made in a manner similar to, and will be in addition to, authorizations under the March 2015 repurchase program. 
    
  In November 2015, as part of our previously authorized share repurchase programs, we entered into a variable term, capped accelerated share repurchase (the "ASR") agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo") to repurchase an aggregate of   $50 million   of our common stock. During 2015, pursuant to the terms of the ASR agreement, we paid   $50 million   in cash and received approximately   3.5 million   shares of our common stock, which represents the minimum number of shares to be delivered based on the cap price. We recorded   $36.9 million   of treasury stock related to these shares. During the   quarter ended September 28, 2016  , we settled the ASR agreement with Wells Fargo. As a result, we received final delivery of an additional   1.5 million   shares of our common stock, bringing the total number of shares repurchased pursuant to the ASR agreement to   5.0 million  . The total number of shares repurchased was based on a combined discounted volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of   $9.90   per share, which was determined based on the average of the daily VWAP of our common stock, less a fixed discount, over the term of the ASR agreement. During July 2016, we recorded   $13.1 million   of treasury stock related to the settlement of the equity forward contract related to the ASR agreement. 
    
  In addition to the settlement of the ASR agreement, during the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  , we repurchased   1.9 million   shares of our common stock for approximately   $19.6 million  . This brings the total amount repurchased under the March 2015 repurchase program to   8.0 million   shares of our common stock for approximately   $81.8 million  , leaving approximately   $18.2 million   of our common stock that can be repurchased under this program as of   September 28, 2016  . Additionally, under the May 2016 repurchase program, we are also authorized to repurchase up to   $100 million   of our common stock as of   September 28, 2016  . 
    
  Repurchased shares are included as treasury stock in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders' Equity.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
    
  The components of the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss were as follows: 

(1) 
    Before-tax amount related to our Other Defined Benefit Plans that was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss and included as a component of pension expense within general and administrative expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income during the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  . See Note 9 for additional details. 
              (2) 
    Before-tax amount related to the liquidation of our Pension Plan that was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss and included as a component of operating (gains), losses and other charges, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income during the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  . See Note 9 for additional details. 
              (3) 
    Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income, represent payments made to the counterparty for the effective portions of the interest rate swaps. These amounts are included as a component of interest expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. We expect to reclassify approximately   $0.7 million   from accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our interest rate swaps during the next twelve months. See Note 8 for additional details. 

Note 15.     Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  We have guarantees related to certain franchisee leases and loans. Payments under these guarantees would result from the inability of a franchisee to fund required payments when due. Through   September 28, 2016  , no events had occurred that caused us to make payments under these guarantees. There were   $8.3 million   and   $8.7 million   of loans outstanding under these programs as of   September 28, 2016   and   December 30, 2015  , respectively. As of   September 28, 2016  , the maximum amounts payable under the lease and loan guarantees were   $2.0 million   and   $1.2 million  , respectively. As a result of these guarantees, we have recorded liabilities of less than   $0.1 million   as of both   September 28, 2016   and   December 30, 2015  , which are included as a component of other noncurrent liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and other nonoperating expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  
  There are various claims and pending legal actions against or indirectly involving us, incidental to and arising out of the ordinary course of the business. In the opinion of management, based upon information currently available, the ultimate liability with respect to these proceedings and claims will not materially affect the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.  
   
  Note 16.     Subsequent Events 
    
  We performed an evaluation of subsequent events and determined that no events required disclosure.

Statements of Income 
    
  The following table contains information derived from our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of total operating revenues, except as noted below. Percentages may not add due to rounding. 

(a) 
    Costs of company restaurant sales percentages are as a percentage of company restaurant sales. Costs of franchise and license revenue percentages are as a percentage of franchise and license revenue. All other percentages are as a percentage of total operating revenue. 
              (b) 
    Equivalent units are calculated as the weighted average number of units outstanding during a defined time period. 
              (c) 
    Same-store sales include sales from restaurants that were open the same period in the prior year. 
              (d) 
    Prior year amounts have not been restated for   2016   comparable units. 

21 

Unit Activity 

Company Restaurant Operations 
    
  During the quarter ended   September 28, 2016  , company restaurant sales   increased     $3.8 million  , or   4.3%  , primarily resulting from a   1.0%     increase   in company same-store sales and a   four   equivalent unit increase in company restaurants as compared to the prior year period. During the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  , company restaurant sales   increased     $8.8 million  , or   3.3%  , primarily resulting from a   1.5%     increase   in company same-store sales and a   two   equivalent unit increase in company restaurants as compared to the prior year period. 
    
  Total costs of company restaurant sales as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased to   82.8%   for the quarter and   82.2%   year-to-date from   84.1%   and   82.9%  , respectively, in the prior year periods.  
    
  Product costs were   24.5%   for the quarter and   24.7%   year-to-date compared to   26.1%   and   25.2%  , respectively, in the prior year periods. These decreases were primarily due to the reduced cost of eggs and the leverage gained from pricing increases.  
    
  Payroll and benefits were   38.7%   for the quarter and   38.3%   year-to-date compared to   38.4%   and   38.3%  , respectively, in the prior year period. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to a 0.5 percentage point increase in labor costs and a 0.3 percentage point increase in workers' compensation costs, partially offset by a 0.6 percentage point decrease in incentive compensation. The year-to-date period was flat as compared to the prior year period, as a 0.7 percentage point increase in labor costs and a 0.3 percentage point increase in group insurance was offset by a 0.8 percentage point decrease in incentive compensation and a 0.3 percentage point decrease in workers' compensation costs. Contributing to the increase in labor costs in the year-to-date period was the impact of the California Paid Sick Leave law, which became effective in July 2015. 
    
  Occupancy costs decreased to   5.3%   for the quarter and   5.4%   year-to-date from   5.8%   and   5.7%  , respectively, in the prior year periods. These decreases were primarily due to decreases in general liability insurance costs. 

22 

Other operating expenses were comprised of the following amounts and percentages of company restaurant sales:  

Franchise Operations 
    
  Franchise and license revenue and costs of franchise and license revenue were comprised of the following amounts and percentages of franchise and license revenue for the periods indicated: 

During the quarter ended   September 28, 2016  , royalties   increase  d   $1.1 million  , or   4.7%  , primarily resulting from a   24   equivalent unit   increase   in franchised and licensed restaurants, a   1.0%     increase   in domestic same-store sales and a higher average royalty rate as compared to the prior year period. During the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  , royalties   increase  d   $2.8 million  , or   4.0%  , primarily resulting from a   18   equivalent unit   increase   in franchised and licensed restaurants, a   0.9%     increase   in domestic same-store sales and a higher average royalty rate as compared to the prior year period. Initial fees   increase  d   $0.2 million   for the quarter and   $0.4 million   year-to-date as a higher number of restaurants were opened by franchisees and sold to franchisees during the current year periods. The   decrease   in occupancy revenue of   $0.6 million  , or   5.5%  , for the quarter and   $2.0 million  , or   6.5%  , year-to-date was primarily the result of lease expirations. 
    
  Costs of franchise and license revenue   decrease  d   $0.4 million  , or   3.5%  , for the quarter and   decrease  d   $1.8 million  , or   5.5%  , year-to-date. Occupancy costs   decrease  d   $0.6 million  , or   7.8%  , for the quarter and   $1.9 million  , or   8.0%  , year-to-date, primarily resulting from lease expirations. Other direct costs   increase  d   $0.2 million  , or   7.4%  , for the quarter and were essentially flat year-to-date. As a result, costs of franchise and license revenue as a percentage of franchise and license revenue   decrease  d to   29.1%   for the quarter from   30.9%   for the prior year quarter and   decrease  d to   29.7%   year-to-date from   31.8%   for the prior year period. 
    
  Other Operating Costs and Expenses 
    
  Other operating costs and expenses such as general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense relate to both company and franchise operations. 

23 

General and administrative   expenses were comprised of the following: 

Other general and administrative expenses   increase  d by   $1.7 million   for the quarter and   $0.8 million   year-to-date primarily resulting from increases of $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to market valuation changes in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities. Offsetting gains on the underlying plan investments are included as a component of other non-operating income, net. The $0.2 million decrease in share-based compensation, as compared to the prior year quarter, primarily resulted from the cancellation of equity awards and subsequent issuance of cash awards to non-employee members of our Board of Directors. See Note 10 for details. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization   was comprised of the following: 

Operating (gains), losses and other charges, net   were comprised of the following: 

The pre-tax pension settlement loss of   $24.3 million   related to the completion of the Pension Plan liquidation during the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  . See Note 9 for details on the Pension Plan liquidation. Gains on sales of assets and other, net of   $0.8 million   for the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016   primarily related to restaurants sold to franchisees. 

24 

Restructuring charges and exit costs were comprised of the following: 

Operating income   was   $17.6 million   for the quarter and   $31.0 million   year-to-date compared with   $15.7 million   and   $48.5 million  , respectively, for the prior year periods. The current year-to-date period was significantly impacted by the $24.3 million pre-tax settlement loss related to the Pension Plan liquidation. 
    
  Interest expense, net   was comprised of the following: 

Interest expense, net increased by $0.8 million for the quarter and $2.2 million year-to-date primarily due to the increased balance of our credit facility and an increase in capital leases. 
    
  Other nonoperating income, net   was   $0.5 million   for the quarter and   $0.6 million   year-to-date compared to other nonoperating expense, net of   $0.6 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively, for the prior year periods. The current year income was primarily the result of gains on deferred compensation plan investments. The prior year expense was primarily the result of losses on deferred compensation plan investments and the year-to-date period included $0.3 million of write-offs of deferred financing costs related to our amended credit facility. 
    
  The   provision for income taxes   was   $5.3 million   for the quarter and   $14.6 million   year-to-date compared to   $3.9 million   and   $14.0 million  , respectively, for the prior year periods. The effective tax rate was   35.2%   for the quarter and   64.2%   year-to-date compared to   30.1%   and   34.0%  , respectively, for the prior year periods. For the 2016 periods, the difference in the overall effective rate from the U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to the Pension Plan liquidation, foreign tax credits and certain discrete items. During the three quarters ended September 28, 2016, we amended prior years  U.S. tax returns in order to maximize a foreign tax credit in lieu of a foreign tax deduction. This created a benefit to the effective tax rate of   4.8%   for the quarter and   4.6%   year-to-date. In addition, during the three quarters ended September 28, 2016, certain discrete items created an increase to the effective tax rate of   4.3%   for the quarter and   4.7%   year-to-date.  
  
   25 

In addition to the items noted above, the 2016 rates were also impacted by the recognition of a $2.1 million tax benefit related to the   $24.3 million   pre-tax settlement loss on the Pension Plan liquidation. This benefit was at a rate lower than the effective tax rate due to the previous recognition of an approximate $7.2 million tax benefit in connection with the reversal of our valuation allowance in 2011. Excluding the impact of the Pension Plan liquidation, our effective income tax rate would have been   35.6%   for the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  . We expect the 2016 fiscal year effective tax rate to be between 33% and 37% excluding the impact of the Pension Plan liquidation. The annual effective tax rate cannot be determined until the end of the fiscal year; therefore, the actual rate could differ from our current estimates. 
    
  Net income   was   $9.7 million   for the quarter and   $8.1 million   year-to-date compared with   $9.0 million   and   $27.2 million  , respectively, for the prior year periods. The current year-to-date period was significantly impacted by the $24.3 million pre-tax settlement loss related to the Pension Plan liquidation. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility (as described below). Principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures and the repurchase of shares of our common stock. 
    
  The following table presents a summary of our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the periods indicated: 

Net cash flows provided by operating activities were   $43.1 million   for the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016   compared to   $56.9 million   for the   three quarters ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities is primarily due to the payout of accrued incentive compensation and the funding of our pension liability during the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  . We believe that our estimated cash flows from operations for   2016  , combined with our capacity for additional borrowings under our credit facility, will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements and fund capital expenditures over the next twelve months. 
    
  Net cash flows   used in   investing activities were   $25.9 million   for the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  . These cash flows include capital expenditures of   $14.6 million   and restaurant acquisition costs of $13.0 million. The restaurant acquisition costs include $12.4 million for nine franchised restaurants reacquired during the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016   and the payment of $0.6 million for a franchised restaurant that was reacquired during 2015. These costs were partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of $1.9 million related to restaurants sold to franchisees.  
    
  Our principal capital requirements have been largely associated with the following: 

26 

Capital expenditures for fiscal   2016   are expected to be approximately $33 to $35 million, including the acquisition of nine franchised restaurants, the completion of approximately 25 remodels at company restaurants, the opening of one new company restaurant, and the scrape and rebuild of a company restaurant. During the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  , we acquired nine franchised restaurants and remodeled 17 company restaurants. 
    
  Cash flows   used in   financing activities were   $17.4 million   for the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  , which included cash payments for stock repurchases of   $19.1 million   and accounts payable funding of $4.4 million, partially offset by net long-term debt borrowings of $5.6 million. 
    
  Our working capital deficit was   $48.1 million   at   September 28, 2016   compared to   $65.1 million   at   December 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in working capital deficit was primarily related to the payout of accrued incentive compensation and the funding of our pension liability during the   three quarters ended September 28, 2016  . We are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because (1) restaurant operations and most food service operations are conducted primarily on a cash (and cash equivalent) basis with a low level of accounts receivable, (2) rapid turnover allows a limited investment in inventories, and (3) accounts payable for food, beverages and supplies usually become due after the receipt of cash from the related sales. 
    
  Credit Facility 
    
  As of   September 28, 2016  , we had outstanding revolver loans of   $203.0 million   and outstanding letters of credit under the senior secured revolver of   $22.4 million  . These balances resulted in availability of   $99.6 million   under the revolving facility. Prior to considering the impact of our interest rate swaps, described below, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding revolver loans was   2.28%   as of   September 28, 2016  . Taking into consideration our interest rate swaps, the weighted-average interest rate of outstanding revolver loans was   2.63%   as of   September 28, 2016  . 
    
  A commitment fee of   0.25%   is paid on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the credit facility bear a tiered interest rate, which is based on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio and was set at LIBOR plus 175 basis points as of   September 28, 2016  . The maturity date for the credit facility is   March 30, 2020  . 
    
  The credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The credit facility is guaranteed by the Company and its material subsidiaries and is secured by assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the stock of the Company's subsidiaries. It includes negative covenants that are usual for facilities and transactions of this type. The credit facility also includes certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. 
    
  Interest Rate Hedges 
    
  We have interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our floating rate debt. We designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to payments of LIBOR due on specific notional debt obligations. 
    
  Based on the interest rate as determined by our consolidated leverage ratio in effect as of   September 28, 2016  , under the terms of the swaps, we will pay the following fixed rates on the notional amounts noted: 

As of   September 28, 2016  , the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of   $14.6 million  , which is recorded as a component of other noncurrent liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

Implementation of New Accounting Standards 
    
  Information regarding the implementation of new accounting standards is incorporated by reference from Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in Part I of this report.

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  There have been no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative market risks since the prior reporting period. 

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures 
    
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), our management conducted an evaluation (under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer, John C. Miller, and our Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, F. Mark Wolfinger) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, Messrs. Miller and Wolfinger each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including Messrs. Miller and Wolfinger, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
