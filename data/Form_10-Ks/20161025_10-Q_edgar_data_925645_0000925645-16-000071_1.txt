1.    ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS 
  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd., a Bermuda company limited by shares, is a media and entertainment company operating in Central and Eastern Europe. Our assets are held through a series of Dutch and Cura ao holding companies. We manage our business on a geographical basis, with   six   operating segments, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Romania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia, which are also our reportable segments and our main operating countries. See   Note 18, "Segment Data"   for financial information by segment. 
  We have market leading broadcast operations in   six   countries in Central and Eastern Europe broadcasting a total of   36   television channels. Each country also develops and produces content for their television channels. We generate advertising revenues in our country operations primarily through entering into agreements with advertisers, advertising agencies and sponsors to place advertising on the television channels that we operate. We generate additional revenues by collecting fees from cable and direct-to-home ( DTH ) operators for carriage of our channels. Unless otherwise indicated, we own   100%   of our broadcast operating and license companies in each country. 
  Bulgaria 
  We operate   one   general entertainment channel, BTV, and   five   other channels, BTV CINEMA, BTV COMEDY, RING, BTV ACTION and BTV LADY. We own   94.0%   of CME Bulgaria B.V. ("CME Bulgaria"), the subsidiary that owns our Bulgaria operations.  
  Croatia 
  We operate   one   general entertainment channel, NOVA TV (Croatia), and   three   other channels, DOMA (Croatia), NOVA WORLD and MINI TV. 
  Czech Republic 
  We operate   one   general entertainment channel, TV NOVA (Czech Republic), and   seven   other channels, NOVA CINEMA, NOVA SPORT 1, NOVA SPORT 2, FANDA, SMICHOV, TELKA and NOVA INTERNATIONAL, a general entertainment channel broadcasting in the Slovak Republic launched on February 1, 2016. 
  Romania 
  We operate   one   general entertainment channel, PRO TV, and   eight   other channels, ACASA, ACASA GOLD, PRO CINEMA, SPORT.RO, MTV ROMANIA, PRO TV INTERNATIONAL, PRO TV CHISINAU, a general entertainment channel broadcasting in Moldova, and ACASA IN MOLDOVA. 
  Slovak Republic 
  We operate   one   general entertainment channel, TV MARKIZA, and   three   other channels, DOMA (Slovak Republic), DAJTO, and MARKIZA INTERNATIONAL, a general entertainment channel broadcasting in the Czech Republic launched on February 1, 2016. 
  Slovenia 
  We operate   two   general entertainment channels, POP TV and KANAL A, and   three   other channels, KINO, BRIO, and OTO. 
   
  2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  The terms the  Company ,  we ,  us , and  our  are used in this Form 10-Q to refer collectively to the parent company, Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. ( CME Ltd. ), and the subsidiaries through which our various businesses are conducted. Unless otherwise noted, all statistical and financial information presented in this report has been converted into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. All references to  US$ ,  USD  or  dollars  are to U.S. dollars; all references to  BGN  are to Bulgarian leva; all references to  HRK  are to Croatian kuna; all references to  CZK  are to Czech koruna; all references to  RON  are to the New Romanian lei; and all references to  Euro  or  EUR  are to the European Union Euro. 
  Interim Financial Statements 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( US GAAP ). Amounts as of   December 31, 2015   included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on   February 22, 2016  . Our significant accounting policies have not changed since   December 31, 2015  , except as noted below. 
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with US GAAP for complete financial statements. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year. 
  Functional Currency 
  Following the refinancing of the remaining outstanding dollar-denominated debt with Euro-denominated debt in April 2016, CME Ltd.'s income and expenses are primarily denominated in Euro. It is anticipated that CME Ltd.'s cash flows will primarily be in Euro. Accordingly, management has determined that CME Ltd.'s functional currency is the Euro with effect from April 1, 2016. As a result of this change, we recognized US$   4.2 million   of currency translation adjustment in the second quarter of 2016 due to the translation of non-monetary assets into Euro as of the date of the change. Our reporting currency continues to be the U.S. dollar.

Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 
  Basis of Consolidation 
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CME Ltd. and our subsidiaries, after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. Entities in which we hold less than a majority voting interest but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method. Other investments are accounted for using the cost method. 
  Goodwill and Intangibles 
  Historically, we have assessed the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable. During the third quarter of 2016, we elected to change the date of our assessment for all of our reporting units from December 31 to October 1. We believe this change will more closely align the assessment with our long- and short-range business planning and forecasting process. The voluntary change in accounting principle related to the annual testing date will not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. This change is not applied retrospectively as it is impracticable to do so because retrospective application would require application of significant estimates and assumptions with the use of hindsight. Accordingly, the change will be applied prospectively. We have not yet completed our assessment as of October 1, 2016. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Accounting Pronouncements Adopted 
  On January 1, 2016 we adopted the following guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ): 
  In November 2014, the FASB issued guidance which standardizes the method used in the accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share. The guidance requires an entity to consider all relevant terms and features in evaluating the nature of the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument, including the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction of the carrying amount of that liability. The retrospective adoption of this guidance decreased our other non-current assets as at December 31, 2015 by US$   13.8 million  , with a corresponding decrease in our long-term debt and other financing arrangements in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, with no impact to our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income / loss or condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Certain amounts in the prior year's condensed consolidated balance sheets have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance which requires that deferred tax balances be classified as non-current in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The prospective adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on our net deferred income tax liability. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted. 
  In the third quarter of 2016, we adopted the FASB guidance issued in March 2016 intended to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions, specifically with regard to accounting for forfeitures, income taxes, the classification as either equity or liabilities and the presentation in the statement of cash flows. We have made a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as a result of adopting this guidance was not material. The adoption of this guidance did not have any other material impacts on our condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Issued 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance which is intended to improve the comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets. The guidance supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance and requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing leasing assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring additional disclosures about an entity's leasing arrangements. The guidance requires that a lessee recognize a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset, with an available exception for leases shorter than twelve months. The guidance is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

3.    GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
  Goodwill: 
  Goodwill by reporting unit as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows: 

Broadcast licenses and other intangible assets: 
  The gross value and accumulated amortization of broadcast licenses and other intangible assets was as follows as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Broadcast licenses consist of our TV NOVA license in the Czech Republic, which is amortized on a straight-line basis through the expiration date of the license in 2025. Customer relationships are deemed to have an economic useful life of, and are amortized on a straight-line basis, over   five years   to   fifteen years  . 
   
  4.    LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS 
  Summary 

Financing Transactions 
  On April 7, 2016, we drew the EUR   468.8 million   (approximately US$   534.0 million   as at the transaction date) 2021 Euro Term Loan in full, the proceeds of which, together with cash on hand, were applied toward the repayment of the outstanding US$   38.2 million   of the   15.0%   term loan facility due 2017 (the "2017 Term Loan"), plus US$   1.5 million   of accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and toward the redemption and discharge of the outstanding US$   502.5 million   of the   15.0%   Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the "2017 PIK Notes"), plus US$   26.6 million   of accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

  (Tabular amounts in US$ 000 s, except share and per share data) 
  (Unaudited) 

Also on April 7, 2016, we extended the maturity date of the 2018 Euro Term Loan by   one   year to November 1, 2018. In addition, we extended the maturity date of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility to February 19, 2021, with a borrowing capacity of US$   50.0 million   with effect from January 1, 2018. We also amended the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility such that interest is determined on the basis of our net leverage ratio (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) and ranges from   10.0%   (if our net leverage ratio is greater than or equal to   seven   times) to   7.0%   per annum (if our net leverage ratio is less than   five   times). The modifications of the 2018 Euro Term Loan and the 2019 Euro Term Loan were accounted for in the same manner as a debt extinguishment.  
  As a result of the above transactions, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of US$   150.2 million   in the second quarter of 2016. 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   we paid US$   27.5 million   of accrued Guarantee Fees (as defined below) related to the 2018 Euro Term Loan for which we had previously made an election to pay in kind. The accrued Guarantee Fee payments are presented as cash outflows from operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
  Overview 
  Total long-term debt and credit facilities comprised the following at   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)   
    Debt issuance costs related to the 2018 Euro Term Loan, 2019 Euro Term Loan and 2021 Euro Term Loan are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the life of the respective instruments. Debt issuance costs related to the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility are classified as non-current assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. 
     Long-term Debt 
  Our long-term debt comprised the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

2018 Euro Term Loan 
  As at   September 30, 2016  , the principal amount of our floating rate senior unsecured term credit facility (as amended, the "2018 Euro Term Loan") outstanding was EUR   250.8 million   (approximately US$   279.9 million  ). The 2018 Euro Term Loan bears interest at three-month EURIBOR (fixed pursuant to customary hedging arrangements (see   Note 11, "Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements"  )) plus a margin of between   1.1%   and   1.9%   depending on the credit rating of Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner"). As at   September 30, 2016  , the all-in borrowing rate on amounts outstanding under the 2018 Euro Term Loan was   8.5%   (the components of which are shown in the table below under the heading "Interest Rate Summary"). 
  Interest on the 2018 Euro Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears on each March 12, June 12, September 12 and December 12. The 2018 Euro Term Loan matures on November 1, 2018 and may be prepaid at our option, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon the occurrence of certain events, including if our net leverage (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) decreases to below   five   times for two consecutive quarters, or at any time from November 1, 2017. The 2018 Euro Term Loan is a senior unsecured obligation of CME Ltd., and is unconditionally guaranteed by our   100%   owned subsidiary CME Media Enterprises B.V. ("CME BV") and by Time Warner and certain of its subsidiaries. 
  The fair values of the 2018 Euro Term Loan of US$   236.2 million   and US$   273.0 million   as at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, were determined based on comparable instruments that trade in active markets. This measurement of estimated fair value uses Level 2 inputs as described in   Note 11, "Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements"  . Certain derivative instruments, including contingent event of default and change of control put options, have been identified as being embedded in the 2018 Euro Term Loan. The embedded derivatives are considered clearly and closely related to the 2018 Euro Term Loan, and as such are not required to be accounted for separately.

2019 Euro Term Loan 
  As at   September 30, 2016  , the principal amount of our floating rate senior unsecured term credit facility (the "2019 Euro Term Loan") outstanding was EUR   235.3 million   (approximately US$   262.7 million  ). The 2019 Euro Term Loan bears interest at three-month EURIBOR (fixed pursuant to customary hedging arrangements (see   Note 11, "Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements"  )) plus a margin of between   1.1%   and   1.9%   depending on the credit rating of Time Warner. As at   September 30, 2016  , the all-in borrowing rate on amounts outstanding under the 2019 Euro Term Loan was   8.5%   (the components of which are shown in the table below under the heading "Interest Rate Summary"). 
  Interest on the 2019 Euro Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears on each February 13, May 13, August 13 and November 13. The 2019 Euro Term Loan matures on November 1, 2019 and may currently be prepaid at our option, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The 2019 Euro Term Loan is a senior unsecured obligation of CME Ltd., and is unconditionally guaranteed by CME BV and by Time Warner and certain of its subsidiaries. 
  The fair values of the 2019 Euro Term Loan of US$   204.2 million   and US$   256.2 million   as at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, were determined based on comparable instruments that trade in active markets, plus an applicable spread. This measurement of estimated fair value uses Level 2 inputs as described in   Note 11, "Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements"  . Certain derivative instruments, including contingent event of default and change of control put options, have been identified as being embedded in the 2019 Euro Term Loan.

  As at   September 30, 2016  , the principal amount of our floating rate senior unsecured term credit facility (the "2021 Euro Term Loan") outstanding was EUR   468.8 million   (approximately US$   523.2 million  ). The 2021 Euro Term Loan bears interest at three-month EURIBOR (fixed pursuant to customary hedging arrangements (see   Note 11, "Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements"  )) plus a margin of between   1.1%   and   1.9%   depending on the credit rating of Time Warner. The all-in borrowing rate including the Guarantee Fee ranges from   10.5%   (if our net leverage ratio is greater than or equal to   eight   times) to   7.0%   per annum (if our net leverage ratio is less than   five   times). As at   September 30, 2016  , the all-in borrowing rate on amounts outstanding under the 2021 Euro Term Loan was   10.0%   (the components of which are shown in the table below under the heading "Interest Rate Summary"). 
  Interest on the 2021 Euro Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears on each April 7, July 7, October 7 and January 7. The 2021 Euro Term Loan matures on February 19, 2021 and may be prepaid at our option, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon the earlier of the occurrence of certain events, including if our net leverage (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) decreases to below   five   times for two consecutive quarters, or at any time from February 19, 2020. The 2021 Euro Term Loan is a senior unsecured obligation of CME BV, and is unconditionally guaranteed by CME Ltd. and by Time Warner and certain of its subsidiaries. 
  The fair value of the 2021 Euro Term Loan of US$   366.1 million   as at   September 30, 2016   was determined based on comparable instruments that trade in active markets, plus an applicable spread. This measurement of estimated fair value uses Level 2 inputs as described in   Note 11, "Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements"  . Certain derivative instruments, including contingent event of default and change of control put options, have been identified as being embedded in the 2021 Euro Term Loan. The embedded derivatives are considered clearly and closely related to the 2021 Euro Term Loan, and as such are not required to be accounted for separately. 
  Reimbursement Agreement and Guarantee Fees 
  In connection with Time Warner s guarantees of the 2018 Euro Term Loan, 2019 Euro Term Loan and 2021 Euro Term Loan (collectively, the  Euro Term Loans ), we entered into a reimbursement agreement (as amended, the  Reimbursement Agreement") with Time Warner which provides for the payment of guarantee fees (collectively, the "Guarantee Fees") to Time Warner as consideration for those guarantees, and that we will reimburse Time Warner for any amounts paid by them under any guarantee or through any loan purchase right exercised by Time Warner. The loan purchase right allows Time Warner to purchase any amount outstanding under the Euro Term Loans from the lenders following an event of default under the Euro Term Loans or the Reimbursement Agreement. The Reimbursement Agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by both our   100%   owned subsidiary Central European Media Enterprises N.V. ("CME NV") and CME BV and is secured by a pledge over   100%   of the outstanding shares of each of CME NV and CME BV. The covenants and events of default under the Reimbursement Agreement are substantially the same as under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. 
  We pay Guarantee Fees to Time Warner based on the amounts outstanding on the Euro Term Loans calculated on a per annum basis as shown in the table below. For the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized US$   20.4 million   and US$   49.3 million   and US$   4.8 million   and US$   14.4 million  , respectively, of Guarantee Fees as interest expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income / loss. 
  The Guarantee Fees relating to the 2018 Euro Term Loan and the 2019 Euro Term Loan are payable semi-annually in arrears on each May 1 and November 1, in cash or in kind (by adding such semi-annual Guarantee Fees to any such amount then outstanding). The Guarantee Fees relating to the 2021 Euro Term Loan are payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 1 and December 1 with the first   5.0%   (including the base rate and the rate paid pursuant to the hedging arrangements) paid in cash and the remainder payable at our election in cash or in kind. 
  The Guarantee Fees paid in kind are presented as a component of other non-current liabilities (see   Note 10, "Other Liabilities"  ) and bear interest per annum at their respective Guarantee Fee rate (as set forth in the table below), payable semi-annually in arrears in cash or in kind (by adding such semi-annual Guarantee Fees to any such amount then outstanding) on each respective payment date. Guarantee Fees paid in cash are included in cash flows from operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

Interest Rate Summary   

     2021 Revolving Credit Facility 
  We had   no   balance outstanding under the US$   115.0 million   revolving credit facility (the  2021 Revolving Credit Facility ), all of which was available to be drawn, as at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate per annum based on, at our option, an alternative base rate plus   8.0%   or an amount equal to the greater of (i) an adjusted LIBO rate and (ii)   1.0%  , plus, in each case,   9.0%  , with the first   5.0%   paid in cash and the remainder payable at our election in cash or in kind by adding such accrued interest to the applicable principal amount outstanding under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. The interest rate on the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility is determined on the basis of our net leverage ratio (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) and ranges from   10.0%   (if our net leverage is greater than or equal to   seven   times) to   7.0%   per annum (if our net leverage ratio is less than   five   times). The maturity date of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility is February 19, 2021 with the available amount decreasing to US$   50.0 million   with effect from January 1, 2018. When drawn, the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility permits prepayment at our option in whole or in part without penalty.

  11.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to those valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: 
  Basis of Fair Value Measurement 
           Level 1 
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted instruments. 
              Level 2 
    Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
              Level 3 
    Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
     A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
  We evaluate the position of each financial instrument measured at fair value in the hierarchy individually based on the valuation methodology we apply. The carrying amount of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these items. The fair value of our long-term debt is included in   Note 4, "Long-term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements"  . 
  Hedge Accounting Activities 
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  We are party to interest rate swap agreements to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the outstanding principal amount of our Euro Term Loans. These interest rate swaps, designated as cash flow hedges, provide us with variable-rate cash receipts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the lives of the agreements, with no exchange of the underlying notional amount. These instruments are carried at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, and the effective portion of changes in the fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income / loss and subsequently reclassified to interest expense when the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value is recognized immediately in the change in fair value of derivatives in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income / loss. For the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not recognize any charges related to hedge ineffectiveness.

  CENTRAL EUROPEAN MEDIA ENTERPRISES LTD. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Tabular amounts in US$ 000 s, except share and per share data) 
  (Unaudited) 

Information relating to financial instruments is as follows:   

  We value the interest rate swap agreements using a valuation model which calculates the fair value on the basis of the net present value of the estimated future cash flows. The most significant input used in the valuation model is the expected EURIBOR-based yield curve. These instruments were allocated to Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because the critical inputs to this model, including current interest rates, relevant yield curves and the known contractual terms of the instruments, were readily observable. 

Non-Hedge Accounting Activities 
  The change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments comprised the following for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :   

  Foreign Currency Risk 
  We have entered into a number of forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates related to contractual payments under certain dollar-denominated agreements and to the refinancing of certain long-term debt. Information relating to financial instruments is as follows:   

  These forward foreign exchange contracts are considered economic hedges but were not designated as hedging instruments, so changes in the fair value of the derivatives were recorded as changes in fair value of derivatives in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income / loss and in the condensed consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities. We valued these contracts using an industry-standard pricing model which calculated the fair value on the basis of the net present value of the estimated future cash flows receivable or payable. These instruments were allocated to Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because the critical inputs to this model, including foreign exchange forward rates and the known contractual terms of the instruments, were readily observable.

12.    CONVERTIBLE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES 
  200,000   shares of our Series B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value US$   0.08   per share (the  Series B Preferred Shares ), were issued and outstanding as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . As at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of the Series B Preferred Shares was US$   252.5 million   and US$   241.2 million  , respectively. The Series B Preferred Shares are held by Time Warner Media Holdings B.V. ("TW Investor"). As of   September 30, 2016  , the   200,000   shares of Series B preferred stock were convertible into approximately   104.2 million   shares of Class A common stock. 
  The initial stated value of the Series B Preferred Shares of US$   1,000   per share accretes at an annual rate of   3.75%  , compounded quarterly, from and including June 25, 2016 to but excluding the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. We have the right to pay cash to the holder in lieu of any further accretion. Each Series B Preferred Share may, at the holder's option, be converted into the number of shares of our Class A common stock determined by dividing (i) the accreted stated value plus accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, in each case as of the conversion date, by (ii) the conversion price, which was approximately US$   2.42   at   September 30, 2016  , but is subject to adjustment from time to time pursuant to customary weighted-average anti-dilution provisions with respect to our issuances of equity or equity-linked securities at a price below the then-applicable conversion price (excluding any securities issued under our benefit plans at or above fair market value). We have the right to redeem the Series B Preferred Shares in whole or in part upon   30 days  ' written notice. The redemption price of each outstanding Series B Preferred Share is equal to its accreted stated value plus accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, in each case as of the redemption date specified in the redemption notice. After receipt of a redemption notice, each holder of Series B Preferred Shares will have the right to convert, prior to the date of redemption, all or part of such Series B Preferred Shares to be redeemed by us into shares of our Class A common stock in accordance with the terms of conversion described above. 
  Holders of the Series B Preferred Shares have no voting rights on any matter presented to holders of any class of our capital stock, with the exception that they may vote with holders of shares of our Class A common stock (i) with respect to a change of control event or (ii) as provided by our Bye-laws or applicable Bermuda law. Holders of Series B Preferred Shares will participate in any dividends declared or paid on our Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The Series B Preferred Shares rank pari passu with our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and senior to all other equity securities of the Company in respect of payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation. The Series B Preferred Shares have such other rights, powers and preferences as are set forth in the Certificate of Designation for the Series B Preferred Shares. 
  We concluded that the Series B Preferred Shares were not considered a liability and that the embedded conversion feature in the Series B Preferred Shares was clearly and closely related to the host contract and therefore did not need to be bifurcated. The Series B Preferred Shares are required to be classified outside of permanent equity because such shares can be redeemed for cash in certain circumstances. The Series B Preferred Shares are carried on the balance sheet at redemption value. As the Series B Preferred Shares are redeemable, we have accreted changes in the redemption value since issuance. For the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized accretion on the Series B Preferred Shares of US$   2.4 million   and US$   11.3 million  ; and US$   4.4 million   and US$   12.8 million  , respectively, with corresponding decreases in additional paid-in capital, net of the effect of foreign exchange. 
   
  13.    EQUITY 
  Preferred Stock 
  5,000,000   shares of Preferred Stock were authorized as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  One   share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred Share") was issued and outstanding as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Series A Preferred Share is convertible into   11,211,449   shares of Class A common stock on the date that is   61 days   after the date on which the ownership of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock by a group that includes TW Investor and its affiliates would not be greater than   49.9%  . The Series A Preferred Share is entitled to   one   vote per each share of Class A common stock into which it is convertible and has such other rights, powers and preferences, including potential adjustments to the number of shares of Class A common stock to be issued upon conversion, as are set forth in the Certificate of Designation for the Series A Preferred Share. 
  200,000   shares of Series B Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (see   Note 12, "Convertible Redeemable Preferred Shares"  ). As of   September 30, 2016  , the   200,000   Series B Preferred Shares were convertible into approximately   104.2 million   shares of Class A common stock. 
  Class A and Class B Common Stock 
  440,000,000   shares of Class A common stock and   15,000,000   shares of Class B common stock were authorized as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The rights of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical except for voting rights. The shares of Class A common stock are entitled to   one   vote per share and the shares of Class B common stock are entitled to   ten   votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock are convertible into shares of Class A common stock on a   one  -for-  one   basis for no additional consideration. Holders of each class of shares are entitled to receive dividends and upon liquidation or dissolution are entitled to receive all assets available for distribution to holders of our common stock. Under our Bye-laws, the holders of each class have no preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions with respect to such shares. 
  There were   142.4 million   and   135.8 million   shares of Class A common stock outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and   no   shares of Class B common stock outstanding at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  As at   September 30, 2016  , TW Investor owns   43.1%   of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and has a   47.3%   voting interest in the Company due to its ownership of the Series A Preferred Share. 
  Warrants 
  On May 2, 2014, we issued   114,000,000   warrants in connection with a rights offering. Each warrant may be exercised from   May 2, 2016   until May 2, 2018 and entitles the holder thereof to receive   one   share of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of US$   1.00   per share in cash. During   2016  ,   5,947,010   warrants were exercised resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately US$   5.9 million  . As at   September 30, 2016  ,   108,052,990   warrants remain outstanding. Time Warner and TW Investor collectively hold   100,926,996   of these warrants (approximately   93.4%  ). The warrants are classified in additional paid-in capital, a component of equity, and are not subject to subsequent revaluation.

  For the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized charges for stock-based compensation of US$   0.7 million   and US$   2.5 million  ; and US$   0.6 million   and US$   1.5 million  , respectively, presented as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income / loss. 
  Stock Options 
  A summary of option activity for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   is presented below: 

The fair value of stock options is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and recognized ratably over the requisite service period. The aggregate intrinsic value (the difference between the stock price on the last day of trading of the   third quarter   of   September 30, 2016   and the exercise prices multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) represents the total intrinsic value that would have been received by the option holders had they exercised all in-the-money options as at   September 30, 2016  . This amount changes based on the fair value of our Class A common stock. As at   September 30, 2016  , there was US$   2.2 million   unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.9 years  .

Restricted Stock Units 
  Each RSU represents a right to receive   one   share of Class A common stock according to its vesting conditions. The majority of RSU issued have time-based vesting conditions and vest ratably over   one   to   four   years from the date of grant. Vesting of RSU with performance-based vesting conditions ("PRSU") is contingent on the achievement of cumulative OIBDA and unlevered free cash flow targets over a multi-year period. Upon vesting, shares of Class A common stock are issued from authorized but unissued shares. Holders of RSU and PRSU awards are not entitled to receive cash dividend equivalents and are not entitled to vote. The grant date fair values of RSU and PRSU are calculated as the closing price of our Class A common shares on the date of grant. 
  The following table summarizes information about unvested RSU and PRSU as at   September 30, 2016  : 

As at   September 30, 2016  , the intrinsic value of unvested RSUs was US$   6.1 million  . Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs as at   September 30, 2016   was US$   3.6 million   and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.4 years  . 
   
  17.    EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  We determined that the Series B Preferred Shares are a participating security, and accordingly, our basic and diluted net income / loss per share is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, basic net income / loss per common share is computed by dividing the net income available to common shareholders after deducting contractual amounts of accretion on our Series B Preferred Shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income / loss per share is computed by dividing the adjusted net income by the weighted-average number of dilutive shares outstanding during the period. 
  The components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows: 

(1)   
    For the purpose of computing basic earnings per share, the   11,211,449   shares of Class A common stock underlying the Series A Preferred Share are included in the weighted average outstanding shares of common stock - basic, because the holder of the Series A Preferred Share is entitled to receive any dividends payable when dividends are declared by the Board of Directors with respect to any shares of common stock.

At   September 30, 2016  ,   107,665,348   warrants, stock options, RSUs and shares underlying the Series B Preferred Shares were antidilutive to income from continuing operations and excluded from the calculation of earnings per share. These instruments may become dilutive in the future. As set forth in the Certificate of Designation for the Series B Preferred Shares, the holders of our Series B Preferred Shares are not contractually obligated to share in our losses. 
   
  18.    SEGMENT DATA 
  We manage our business on a geographical basis, with   six   operating segments: Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Romania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia, which are also our reportable segments and our main operating countries. These segments reflect how CME Ltd. s operating performance is evaluated by our chief operating decision makers, who we have identified as our co-Chief Executive Officers; how operations are managed by segment managers; and the structure of our internal financial reporting. 
  Our segments generate revenues primarily from the sale of advertising and sponsorship on our channels. This is supplemented by revenues from cable and satellite television service providers to carry our channels on their platforms and from revenues through the sale of distribution rights to third parties. Intersegment revenues and profits have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  We evaluate our consolidated results and the performance of our segments based on net revenues and OIBDA (as defined below). We believe OIBDA is useful to investors because it provides a meaningful representation of our performance as it excludes certain items that either do not impact our cash flows or the operating results of our operations. OIBDA is also used as a component in determining management bonuses.  
  OIBDA includes amortization and impairment of program rights and is calculated as operating income / loss before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, impairments of assets and certain unusual or infrequent items that are not considered by our chief operating decision makers when evaluating our performance. Stock-based compensation and certain other items are not allocated to our segments for purposes of evaluating their performance and therefore are not included in their respective OIBDA. 
  Below are tables showing our net revenues, OIBDA, total assets, capital expenditures and long-lived assets for our continuing operations by segment for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   for condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income / loss data and condensed consolidated statements of cash flow data; and as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for condensed consolidated balance sheet data.

19.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Commitments 
  a) Programming Rights Agreements and Other Commitments 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had total commitments of US$   139.8 million   (  December 31, 2015  : US$   144.9 million  ) in respect of future programming, including contracts signed with license periods starting after the balance sheet date. In addition, we have digital transmission obligations, future minimum operating lease payments for non-cancellable operating leases with remaining terms in excess of one year (net of amounts to be recharged to third parties) and other commitments as follows: 

b) Call option 
  Top Tone Holdings has exercised its right to acquire additional equity in CME Bulgaria, however the closing of this transaction has not yet occurred because the purchaser financing is still pending. If consummated, we would own   90.0%   of our Bulgaria operations. 
  Contingencies 
  a) Litigation 
  We are from time to time party to legal proceedings, arbitrations and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of our business operations. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in such matters and provide accruals for such matters, as appropriate. In making such decisions, we consider the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of a loss. An unfavorable outcome in any such proceedings, if material, could have an adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial statements.

b) Restrictions on dividends from Consolidated Subsidiaries and Unconsolidated Affiliates 
  Corporate law in the Central and Eastern European countries in which we have operations stipulates generally that dividends may be declared by shareholders, out of yearly profits, subject to the maintenance of registered capital and required reserves after the recovery of accumulated losses. The reserve requirement restriction generally provides that before dividends may be distributed, a portion of annual net profits (typically   5.0%  ) be allocated to a reserve, which reserve is capped at a proportion of the registered capital of a company (ranging from   5.0%   to   25.0%  ). The restricted net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries and equity in earnings of investments accounted for under the equity method together are less than   25.0%   of consolidated net assets. 
   
  20.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  We consider our related parties to be our officers, directors and shareholders who have direct control and/or influence over the Company as well as other parties that can significantly influence management. We have identified transactions with individuals or entities associated with Time Warner, which is represented on our Board of Directors and holds a   47.3%   voting interest in CME Ltd. as at   September 30, 2016  , as material related party transactions.

II.    Overview 
  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. ("CME Ltd.") is a media and entertainment company operating mainly in six countries in Central and Eastern Europe. We manage our business on a geographical basis, with   six   operating segments: Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Romania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia, which are also our reportable segments. These operating segments reflect how CME Ltd. s operating performance is evaluated by our chief operating decision makers, who we have identified as our co-Chief Executive Officers, how our operations are managed by segment managers, and the structure of our internal financial reporting. 
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  In this report we refer to several non-GAAP financial measures, including OIBDA, OIBDA margin, free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow. We believe that each of these metrics is useful to investors for the reasons outlined below. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, US GAAP financial measures. 
  We evaluate our consolidated results and the performance of our segments based on net revenues and OIBDA. We believe OIBDA is useful to investors because it provides a meaningful representation of our performance, as it excludes certain items that do not impact either our cash flows or the operating results of our operations. OIBDA and unlevered free cash flow are also used as components in determining management bonuses. 
  OIBDA includes amortization and impairment of program rights and is calculated as operating income / loss before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and impairments of assets and certain unusual or infrequent items that are not considered by our co-CEOs when evaluating our performance. Stock-based compensation and certain other items are not allocated to our segments for purposes of evaluating their performance and therefore are not included in their respective OIBDA. Our key performance measure of the efficiency of our consolidated operations and our segments is OIBDA margin. We define OIBDA margin as the ratio of OIBDA to net revenues. Intersegment revenues and profits have been eliminated on consolidation. 
  We have previously used free cash flow as a measure of the ability of our operations to generate cash. We define free cash flow as cash flows from continuing operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of disposals of property, plant and equipment and excluding the cash impact of certain unusual or infrequent items that are not included in costs charged in arriving at OIBDA because they are not considered by our co-CEOs when evaluating performance. Following the refinancing transaction completed in April 2016, the amount of interest and related Guarantee Fees on our outstanding indebtedness that is paid in cash has increased. Since we expect to use cash generated by the business to pay more interest and related Guarantee Fees in cash, and these cash payments are reflected in free cash flow, we think unlevered free cash flow, defined as free cash flow before cash payments for interest and Guarantee Fees, better illustrates the cash generated by our operations when comparing periods.  
  For additional information regarding our business segments, including a reconciliation of OIBDA to US GAAP financial measures, see Item 1,   Note 18, "Segment Data"  . For a reconciliation of free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow to a US GAAP financial measure, see "Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow" below. 
  The following analysis contains references to like-for-like or constant currency percentage movements ( % Lfl ). These references reflect the impact of applying the current period average exchange rates to the prior period revenues and costs. Given the significant movement of the currencies in the markets in which we operate against the dollar, we believe that it is useful to provide percentage movements based on like-for-like percentage movements as well as actual ( % Act ) percentage movements (which includes the effect of foreign exchange). Unless otherwise stated, all percentage increases or decreases in the following analysis refer to year-on-year percentage changes between the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Executive Summary 
  The following table provides a summary of our consolidated results for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  :  

(1)       Number is not meaningful. 
  Our consolidated net revenues increased   8%   and   5%   at constant and actual exchange rates in the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , due to improvement in both television advertising revenues and carriage fees and subscription revenues. Television advertising spending in the markets of the countries in which we operate grew   5%   overall in the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015. Our television advertising revenues grew   5%   at constant rates during that period due primarily to growth in our three largest markets, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia. Carriage fees and subscription revenues increased   12%   and   8%   at constant rates during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , due primarily to growth in the number of subscribers to cable, satellite and IPTV platforms, better channel offerings and new channel launches.  
  Costs charged in arriving at OIBDA were flat at constant and actual exchange rates in both the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . Our strict focus on the profitability of our businesses enabled us to offset targeted investments in programming in certain countries. As a result, increases in overall content costs at constant rates in the respective three- and nine-month periods were compensated by savings in other costs.  
  
    27 

     Index  

The growth in revenue, combined with cost savings, resulted in an improvement in our OIBDA margin in the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and we anticipate our full year OIBDA margin in 2016 will exceed our OIBDA margin of 20% in 2015. We expect revenues to grow at a faster pace than costs over the next several years, leading to continued OIBDA margin expansion. 
  The decrease in operating income in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 resulted from the reversal of charges in the prior year related to tax audits in Romania, which were accrued in the fourth quarter of 2014 and in the first quarter of 2015 and fully released in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the reversal of US$ 30.2 million and US$ 12.0 million in the   three and nine months   ended September 30, 2015, respectively, operating results for the   three and nine months   ended September 30, 2015 were a loss of US$   1.3 million   and income of US$   36.1 million  , respectively. Operating income in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   benefited from the increase in net revenues and a decrease in operating costs before considering the impact of the reversal.  
  We believe we continue to provide the most efficient medium for advertisers to reach consumers in all countries in which we operate. Although our audience shares were negatively impacted by the summer Olympics in August 2016, the gap between us and our closest commercial competitor widened in five out of six markets during the third quarter. The fall season rolled out during the period, and our prime time audience shares in the month of September improved year-on-year in all six countries. We look to capitalize on the pillars of our programming strategy, which include news, local fiction, and local reality and entertainment, and we will continue to invest in programming on a targeted basis to improve our competitive position as we focus on improving profitability.  
  We ended the quarter with US$   64.2 million   of cash. Our unlevered free cash flow increased   44%   to US$   91.2 million   in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , from US$   63.6 million   in the same period in   2015  . This improvement during the first nine months of 2016 reflected the improvement in OIBDA and lower capital expenditures. Free cash flow decreased   57%   to US$   22.8 million  , from US$   52.9 million   in the same period in   2015   because we paid more interest in cash and elected to repay a total of US$   27.5 million   of accrued Guarantee Fees previously paid in kind during the first nine months of 2016. For the full year, we expect unlevered free cash flow to improve from US$ 73.9 million in 2015, primarily reflecting an increase in OIBDA, which will be partially offset by investments in new local productions for 2017. Cash paid for interest will be higher in 2016 than it was in 2015, and we also plan to use cash to pay the Guarantee Fee related to the 2018 Euro Term Loan payable in November. As a result, we anticipate that free cash flow for 2016 will decrease significantly from US$ 55.5 million in 2015. 
  Market Information 
  The following table sets out our estimates of the year-on-year changes in real GDP, real private consumption and the television advertising market, net of discounts, in our countries for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  : 

*    Romanian market excludes Moldova. 
  Sources: Real GDP Growth and Real Private Consumption Growth, CME Ltd. estimates based on market consensus; TV Ad Market Growth, CME Ltd. estimates at constant exchange rates. 
  After adjusting for inflation, we estimate that during the first nine months of 2016 the rate of overall GDP growth in the countries in which we operate outpaced the average for Western Europe. The growth in our largest markets continues to be driven by domestic demand, which is evidenced by robust growth in real private consumption, in addition to growth in exports. Fiscal stimulus in Romania has contributed to significant growth in private consumption in that country. The overall macro-economic backdrop remains positive, and was reflected in recent International Monetary Fund forecasts that increased real GDP growth projections for 2016 and 2017 in Bulgaria and Romania, the latter being the highest in Europe. We believe that the growth in real GDP and private consumption that is forecast for 2016 across all six of the countries in which we operate will be supportive of overall television advertising market growth during the full year. 
  We continue to monitor the macro-economic environment in the region following the referendum that was held in the United Kingdom on June 23, 2016 whereby the UK electorate voted in favor of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as  Brexit . The overall economic impact of Brexit on the EU and the Euro is difficult to estimate at present, but we have not seen an appreciable impact on the behavior of advertisers in the countries in which we operate. There could be an indirect influence upon GDP growth in the countries in which we operate if it results in a decline in exports. However, current projections suggest the potential reduction in exports would have limited impact on GDP growth, due in part to the improvement in private consumption in these economies since 2014. The departure of the United Kingdom from the EU may also adversely affect the budgetary contributions and allocations among the EU member states, including the countries in which we operate, which are generally net recipients of EU funding. However, existing commitments for budgetary contributions would not be affected, so there is not expected to be any impact on allocations to net recipient countries in the next several years. 
  
    28 

     Index  

We estimate that the TV advertising markets in the countries in which we operate   increased   by   5%   on average in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . In Bulgaria, heavy competition for market share continued to negatively impact average market prices, leading to a decline in the market despite an increase in the volume of gross ratings points ("GRPs") sold. Conversely, the market growth in Croatia was driven by an increase in average market prices and GRPs sold in the first nine months of the year. In the Czech Republic, sell-out rates have increased as advertisers place more advertising than in 2015, but average prices were lower due to significant discounting by the competition to sell their incremental inventory. In Romania, the market was largely sold-out in both the second and third quarters, so the combination of an increase in GRPs sold and higher average prices resulted in significant growth in the first nine months of 2016. The market continues to be largely sold-out, and given constraints in producing more GRPs, we expect lower market growth in Romania in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2016. In the Slovak Republic, the market grew significantly in the first nine months of 2016 due to higher prices. Demand in the first half of the year was also influenced by an increase in spending on informational and political campaigns, but this spending declined year-on-year in the third quarter and is expected to decline significantly in the fourth quarter resulting in a rate of market growth for the full year that is less than the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In Slovenia, a more positive macro-economic environment has encouraged advertisers to increase investments so more inventory was sold at higher average prices.

Bulgaria 

The television advertising market in Bulgaria   declined   an estimated   3%   at constant rates in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Our television advertising revenues decreased by   12%   and   5%   at constant rates in the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Sustained significant competition for market share continues to negatively impact our average prices and this has more than offset an increase in the volume of GRPs sold in each period. The year-to-date period was also negatively impacted by reduced budgets of certain advertising clients during the first quarter. Carriage fees and subscription revenues increased on a constant currency basis in the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   because a contract was renewed at higher prices during the third quarter and the number of subscribers has grown during the course of the year. 
  On a constant currency basis, costs charged in arriving at OIBDA decreased in the third quarter as content costs declined   5%   driven primarily by more efficient production of local programming. This, combined with a decrease in content costs during the second quarter, more than offset an increase in costs during the first three months of the year resulting in lower costs in the first nine months of 2016.

Croatia 

The television advertising market in Croatia   increased   an estimated   1%   at constant rates in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Our television advertising revenues decreased at constant rates during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from selling a lower volume of GRPs, albeit at a higher average price, compared to the same periods in 2015. 
  Costs charged in arriving at OIBDA decreased on a constant currency basis in the third quarter of 2016 due to savings in foreign programming as well as a later start to certain programs in the fall season than in 2015. This savings in the third quarter offset an increase in content costs in the first half of the year as a result of launching an additional entertainment format when compared to the schedule in 2015, so costs were broadly flat in the first nine months of 2016.

Czech Republic 

The television advertising market in the Czech Republic   increased   an estimated   3%   at constant rates in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. 
  On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased in the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , due to increases in both television advertising revenues and carriage fees and subscription revenues. Advertisers bought more GRPs in the third quarter resulting in higher television advertising revenues for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Our average price for advertising over these periods remains under pressure due to significant discounting by the competition to sell incremental inventory provided by channels they launched last year, which partially offset the additional volumes sold. Carriage fees and subscription revenues increased on a constant currency basis in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 due to agreements for high definition versions of our channels in place during 2016, as well as the launch of Nova Sport 2 in September 2015 and the launch of Nova International during the first quarter of 2016. 
  Costs charged in arriving at OIBDA   decreased     1%   on a constant currency basis in the third quarter. Content costs increased slightly, which included spending to produce a second season of our popular reality format,   Your Face Sounds Familiar  , for the fall season that was mostly offset by savings from broadcasting fewer hours of foreign fiction. There were also some incremental costs from operating additional channels, which together with the investment in local content was more than offset by savings in other costs. Total costs charged in arriving at OIBDA increased   3%   at constant rates in the first nine months of 2016 because an increase in content costs from more local productions, foreign movies and sports programming in the first quarter of 2016 outweighed savings of other non-programming costs in the second and third quarters compared to the same periods of last year.

Romania 

The television advertising market in Romania   increased   an estimated   10%   at constant rates in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Demand for advertising on television remained robust during the third quarter of 2016, and we fully monetized additional inventory generated by our main channel compared to last year. This was due in part to the broadcasting of UEFA European Championship matches in the first half of July. Since we sold more GRPs at higher prices, our television advertising revenues increased   23%   at constant rates during the period. This growth in television advertising revenues in the third quarter, combined with pricing driven growth in the second quarter, resulted in an increase in net revenues in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Our channels continue to be largely sold-out, and given constraints in producing more GRPs, we expect lower television advertising revenue growth in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2016. Carriage fees and subscription revenues grew slightly on a constant currency basis during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, due to an increase in the number of subscribers. 
  Costs charged in arriving at OIBDA   decreased     2%   at constant rates during the third quarter due to a decrease in bad debt expense, lower personnel costs following restructuring efforts in 2015, lower professional fees for tax and legal advisors, and savings on satellite transmission costs. This more than offset an increase in content costs, which included the cost of broadcasting matches of the UEFA European Championship as well as increased investment in the prime time schedule. Content costs also increased in the first nine months of 2016, but this was offset by significant savings in other costs so overall costs charged in arriving at OIBDA decreased significantly.

The television advertising market in the Slovak Republic increased an estimated   13%   at constant rates in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Our television advertising revenues grew in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 due primarily to higher prices. The year-to-date period also benefited from an increase in spending on informational and political campaigns during the first half of the year, which began to decline in the third quarter. Growth in our full year television advertising revenues is expected to be lower than the first nine months of 2016 as the campaign spending will be much lower in the fourth quarter of 2016 and year-on-year comparisons will be impacted by the significant volume of such spending in the comparable period of 2015. Carriage fees and subscription revenues increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 due to entering into new agreements with a number of carriers. Also during the third quarter, we did not renew our contract for the terrestrial distribution of our channels in the Slovak Republic effective January 1, 2017. After that date our channels in the country will be exclusively available on cable, satellite and IPTV platforms. This may result in lower audience shares, which could negatively impact our television advertising revenues given our elevated sell-out rate. However, we expect a significant increase in carriage fees and subscription revenues in 2017, as well as a significant decrease in transmission costs. 
  On a constant currency basis costs charged in arriving at OIBDA increased during the third quarter due to an increase of   11%   in content costs from investments in local programming. Our investment in local productions in the third quarter were partially offset by savings from foreign content in the first half of 2016, so content costs increased by   8%   in the first nine months of 2016.

  The television advertising market in Slovenia   increased   an estimated   6%   at constant rates in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Television advertising revenue increased at constant rates during the third quarter due to selling more inventory at higher average prices. Certain advertisers continue to be encouraged by the macro-economic environment in the country and increased their spending with us in the third quarter. This increased spending also benefited the first nine months of 2016 as the growth in our television advertising revenues has improved over the course of the year. Carriage fees and subscription revenues increased in both periods primarily as a result of an increase in the monthly price for our subscription video on demand product, Voyo. 
  On a constant currency basis, costs charged in arriving at OIBDA   increased   during both periods due primarily to an increase in content costs from additional hours of local own produced programming, which was partially offset by savings from foreign programming. The higher cost of local programming, especially during the first nine months of 2016, has also been partially offset by savings from cost cutting measures, mainly due to lower personnel costs.

Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow 

(1)       Number is not meaningful.   

  We ended the quarter with US$   64.2 million   of cash. Our unlevered free cash flow increased   44%   to US$   91.2 million   in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , from US$   63.6 million   in the same period in   2015  . This improvement during the first nine months of 2016 reflected the improvement in OIBDA and lower capital expenditures. Free cash flow decreased   57%   to US$   22.8 million  , from US$   52.9 million   in the same period in   2015   because we paid more interest in cash and elected to repay a total of US$   27.5 million   of accrued Guarantee Fees previously paid in kind during the first nine months of 2016.  
  For the full year, we expect unlevered free cash flow to improve from US$ 73.9 million in 2015, primarily reflecting an increase in OIBDA, which will be partially offset by investments in new local productions for 2017. Cash paid for interest will be higher in 2016 than it was in 2015, and we also plan to use cash to pay the Guarantee Fee related to the 2018 Euro Term Loan payable in November 2016 rather than electing to pay in kind. As a result, we anticipate that free cash flow for 2016 will decrease significantly from US$ 55.5 million in 2015.

III.    Analysis of the Results of Operations and Financial Position 

(1)   
    Number is not meaningful. 

Revenue: 
  Television advertising revenues:   We estimate television advertising spending in our markets grew on average by   5%   in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015, positively impacting our television advertising revenues. See "Overview - Segment Performance" above for additional information on television advertising revenues for each of our operating countries. 
  Carriage fees and subscriptions:   Carriage fees and subscriptions revenue increased during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily in the Czech Republic due to the launch of additional channels in the second half of 2015 and first quarter of 2016, in addition to high definition versions of our channels that are now included in most cable and satellite platforms. Carriage fees revenues also benefited from higher subscriber counts in the current year in multiple segments. See "Overview - Segment Performance" above for additional information on carriage fees and subscription revenues for each of our operating countries. 
  Other revenues:   Other revenues include primarily internet advertising revenues and revenues generated through the licensing of our own productions. Other revenues was broadly flat in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015, but decreased during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year due to fewer licensing arrangements for our own productions and lower production services revenues.

     Index  

Operating Expenses: 
  Content costs:   Content costs (including production costs and amortization and impairment of program rights) increased during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increase is primarily due to more hours of local productions in our broadcast schedules in 2016 than in 2015 and the cost of broadcasting matches of the UEFA European Championship in 2016. These increases were partially offset by savings from foreign programming. 
  Other operating costs:   Other operating costs (excluding content costs, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of broadcast licenses and other intangibles as well as selling, general and administrative expenses) decreased slightly during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , as we continued to focus on the efficiency of our operations. 
  Depreciation of property, plant and equipment:   Total depreciation of property, plant and equipment increased during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to depreciation on production and technical equipment placed in service. 
  Amortization of broadcast licenses and other intangibles:   Total amortization of broadcast licenses and other intangibles decreased during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  . The decrease is due to higher amortization expense in 2015 for certain of our trademarks in Romania that we determined were no longer indefinite-lived and began amortizing from January 1, 2015 which were subsequently divested with the sale of our Romanian studios in the fourth quarter of 2015. The lower amortization expense also reflects certain intangible assets in Bulgaria which were fully amortized in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses:   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to the reversal in the third quarter of 2015 of a charge related to certain tax audits in Romania. Excluding the impact of the reversal of this charge, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   due to lower professional fees, and increased non-recourse factoring activities resulting in lower bad debt expense. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses for   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   also includes charges in respect of non-cash stock-based compensation (see Item 1,   Note 16, "Stock-based Compensation"  ). The charge for stock-based compensation expense in 2016 increased compared to the prior periods reflecting the impact of stock options and performance-based RSUs granted in the first quarters of 2015 and 2016. 
  Operating income / (loss):   The decrease in operating income during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 resulted from the reversal of charges in the prior year related to tax audits in Romania, which were accrued in the fourth quarter of 2014 and in the first quarter of 2015 and fully released in the third quarter of 2015. Operating income in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   benefited from the increase in net revenues and decrease in operating expenses after excluding the impact of the reversal in the same period in 2015. 
  Our operating margin, which is determined as operating income / loss divided by net revenues, was   7%   and   14%   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   25%   and   12%   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . Excluding the charges and subsequent reversal of the charges related to the Romanian tax audits, our operating margin for the   three and nine months   ended September 30, 2015 was negative   1%   and   9%  , respectively. 
  Other income / expense:

    Number is not meaningful. 
     Interest expense:   Interest expense during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   decreased compared to the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to lower amortization of debt discount and issuance costs following the extinguishment of the 2017 PIK Notes and 2017 Term Loan. Interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   also decreased as compared to the same period in 2015 due to the refinancing of the 2017 PIK Notes and the 2017 Term Loan (each 15% per annum) with the 2021 Euro Term Loan (all-in rate of 10.0% per annum as at September 30, 2016). 
  Loss on extinguishment of debt:   During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the redemption and discharge of the 2017 PIK Notes, repayment of the 2017 Term Loan and modifications of 2018 Euro Term Loan and 2019 Euro Term Loan, which were accounted for in a similar manner as a debt extinguishment. 
  Interest income:   Interest income primarily reflects earnings on cash balances.

Foreign currency exchange gain / (loss), net  :   We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. This includes third party receivables and payables, as well as certain of our intercompany loans which are not considered of a long-term investment nature. Our subsidiaries generally receive funding via loans that are denominated in currencies other than the dollar, and any change in the relevant exchange rate will require us to recognize a transaction gain or loss on revaluation. Certain of our intercompany loans are classified as long-term in nature, and therefore gains or losses on revaluation are not recorded through the statement of operations and comprehensive income / loss. See the discussion under "Currency translation adjustment, net" below. 
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized a net gain of US$   13.1 million   comprised of transaction gains of US$   38.1 million   relating to the revaluation of intercompany loans, transaction losses of approximately US$   25.3 million   on our long-term debt and other financing arrangements and transaction gains of US$   0.3 million   relating to the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. 
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized a net loss comprised of US$   9.8 million   transaction losses of US$   23.8 million   relating to the revaluation of intercompany loans, transaction gains of approximately US$   23.5 million   on our long-term debt and other financing arrangements and transaction losses of US$   9.5 million   relating to the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. 
  Change in fair value of derivatives:   During the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized losses as a result of the change in the fair value of our USD/EUR foreign currency forward contracts entered into on December 3, 2015, February 11, 2016 and February 17, 2016. During the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized losses as a result of the change in the fair value of our USD/EUR and USD/CZK foreign currency forward contracts entered into on March 11, 2015 and the USD/EUR foreign currency forward contract entered into on July 2, 2015. See Item 1,   Note 11, "Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements"  . 
  Other income / (expense), net  :   Our other income / expense, net during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was not material. During the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized other expense primarily due to the estimated loss on sale of our Romanian production services business, which was not accounted for as a discontinued operation and the estimated loss on the sale of a building and related land in Bulgaria, both of which were subsequently disposed in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  (Provision) / credit for income taxes  :   The provision for income taxes for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   reflects losses on which no tax benefit has been received as well as tax charges on profits in the Czech Republic and Romania. 
  The credit for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2015 reflects a change in the mix of profits between tax jurisdictions. The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflects valuation allowances in respect of the tax benefit of losses and deferred tax charges on profits in the Czech Republic and Croatia. 
  Our subsidiaries are subject to income taxes at statutory rates ranging from   10.0%   in Bulgaria to   22.0%   in the Slovak Republic. 
  Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests  :   The results attributable to noncontrolling interests for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   primarily relates to the noncontrolling interest share of our Bulgaria operations. 
  Currency translation adjustment, net:   The underlying equity value of our investments (which are denominated in the functional currency of the relevant entity) are converted into dollars at each balance sheet date, with any change in value of the underlying assets and liabilities being recorded as a currency translation adjustment to the balance sheet rather than net income / loss. 
  In the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized other comprehensive income of US$   7.3 million   and US$   15.3 million  , respectively, compared to other comprehensive income of US$   5.5 million   and other comprehensive loss of US$   58.6 million   during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . Included in these amounts are foreign exchange gains and losses on the retranslation of certain of our intercompany loans which are considered to be of a long-term investment nature, and as such, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income / loss, a component of shareholders' equity. For the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized a gain of US$   3.6 million   and a loss US$   3.7 million  , and a gain of US$   3.5 million   and a loss of US$   63.1 million  , respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income / loss. In addition, management determined that CME Ltd.'s functional currency is the Euro with effect from April 1, 2016. As a result of this change, we recognized a charge of US$   4.2 million   of currency translation adjustment in the second quarter of 2016 due to the translation of non-monetary assets into Euro as of the date of the change.  
  The following table illustrates the amount by which the exchange rate of the dollar to the functional currencies of our operations moved between January 1 and   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively:

    Number is not meaningful. 
     Note: The analysis below is intended to highlight the key factors that led to the movements from   December 31, 2015  , excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. 
  Current assets:   Current assets at   September 30, 2016   decreased compared to   December 31, 2015   primarily due lower accounts receivables as a result of non-recourse factoring and lower trailing quarter revenues due to seasonality. In addition, the prospective adoption of new accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in the condensed consolidated balance sheets decreased current assets. 
  Non-current assets:   Non-current assets at   September 30, 2016   increased compared to   December 31, 2015   primarily due to an increase in the amount of local productions ahead of the fall schedule. This increase was offset by depreciation on property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets as well as debt issuance costs associated with our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. 
  Current liabilities:   Current liabilities at   September 30, 2016   increased compared to   December 31, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to accrued Guarantee Fees which are not yet payable, whether in cash or in kind.  
  Non-current liabilities:   Non-current liabilities at   September 30, 2016   increased compared to   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to the refinancing of the 2017 PIK Notes and the 2017 Term Loan, both of which had significant issuance discounts, with the 2021 Euro Term Loan, which had no such discount. 
  Temporary equity:   Temporary equity at   September 30, 2016   increased compared to   December 31, 2015  , due to the accretion on the Series B Preferred Shares. 
  CME Ltd. shareholders  (deficit) / equity  :   CME Ltd. shareholders  equity decreased compared to   December 31, 2015  . This primarily reflects the net loss attributable to CME Ltd., a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to currency translation adjustments during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and accretion of the preferred dividend paid in kind on our Series B Preferred Shares. 
  Noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries:   Noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries at   September 30, 2016   decreased compared to   December 31, 2015  , due to the net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Bulgaria. 
   
  IV.    Liquidity and Capital Resources 
   
  IV (a)    Summary of Cash Flows 
  Cash and cash equivalents   increased   by US$   2.6 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . The change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented below is summarized as follows: 

Operating Activities 
  Cash generated from operations during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was US$   42.6 million   compared to US$   79.1 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease compared to the prior period reflects higher payments in 2016 for cash interest and accrued Guarantee Fees, which more than offset increases in operating cash flows due to better OIBDA performance. In the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we made US$   27.5 million   of payments for accrued Guarantee Fees for which we previously made an election to pay in kind. We paid cash interest (including mandatory cash-pay Guarantee Fees) of US$   40.9 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to US$   10.7 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Investing Activities 
  Our net cash used in investing activities of US$   19.7 million   and US$   26.2 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to capital expenditures.

     Index  

Financing Activities 
  Cash used in financing activities during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was US$   23.4 million   compared to US$   27.7 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The amount of net cash used in financing activities in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   primarily reflected the refinancing of the 2017 PIK Notes and the 2017 Term Loan with the proceeds of the 2021 Euro Term Loan and cash on hand. The net cash used in financing activities in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   primarily reflected the repayment of amounts drawn on the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, including accrued interest which we had elected to pay in kind by adding it to the then-outstanding principal amount. 
  Discontinued Operations 
  The net cash provided by discontinued operations during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was US$   0.7 million   compared US$   4.0 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The net cash provided by discontinued operations for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   is due to the receipt of deferred proceeds from the divestiture of businesses in the prior year. 
   
  IV (b)    Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Our ongoing source of cash is primarily the receipt of payments from advertisers, advertising agencies and distributors of our television channels. We also have available the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility (see Item 1,   Note 4, "Long-term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements"  ). As at   September 30, 2016  , the undrawn aggregate principal amount available under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility was US$ 115.0 million. Surplus cash, after funding ongoing operations, may be remitted to us, where appropriate, by our subsidiaries in the form of debt interest payments and capital repayments, dividends, and other distributions and loans from our subsidiaries. 
  Corporate law in the Central and Eastern European countries in which we operate stipulates generally that dividends may be declared by the partners or shareholders out of yearly profits subject to the maintenance of registered capital, required reserves and after the recovery of accumulated losses. The reserve requirement restriction generally provides that before dividends may be distributed, a portion of annual net profits (typically   5.0%  ) be allocated to a reserve, which is capped at a proportion of the registered capital of a company (ranging from   5.0%   to   25.0%  ). The restricted net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries and equity in earnings of investments accounted for under the equity method together are less than   25.0%   of consolidated net assets. 
   
  IV (c)    Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Our future contractual obligations as at   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

Long-Term Debt 
  For more information on our long-term debt, see Item 1,   Note 4, "Long-term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements"  . Interest payable on our long-term debt is calculated using exchange rates and interest rates in effect as at   September 30, 2016  . For the purposes of the above table, it is assumed that the Guarantee Fees will be paid in kind at each interest payment date through the maturity dates of the respective Euro Term Loan. However, we intend to allocate excess cash towards the Guarantee Fee related to the 2018 Euro Term Loan rather than electing to pay in kind. 
  Unconditional Purchase Obligations 
  Unconditional purchase obligations primarily comprise future programming commitments. At   September 30, 2016  , we had commitments in respect of future programming of US$   139.8 million  . This includes contracts signed with license periods starting after   September 30, 2016  . 
  Operating Leases 
  For more information on our operating lease commitments see Item 1,   Note 19, "Commitments and Contingencies"  . 
  Other Long-Term Obligations 
  Other long-term obligations are primarily comprised of digital transmission commitments. 
  Other 
  Top Tone Holdings has exercised its right to acquire additional equity in CME Bulgaria. However, the closing of this transaction has not yet occurred because the purchaser financing is still pending. If consummated, we would own   90.0%   of our Bulgaria broadcast operations. The option strike price is the fair value of the equity in CME Bulgaria, as determined by an independent valuation.

IV (d)    Cash Outlook 
  Because cash flows from operating activities were negative in 2012, 2013 and 2014, we relied on equity and debt financings to ensure adequate funding for our operations. While cash flows from operating activities were positive in 2015 and are anticipated to be positive in 2016, our election to pay interest on the 2017 PIK Notes and the 2017 Term Loan and Guarantee Fees in kind increased our leverage. In response, we have sought other capital resources to fund our operations, our debt service and other obligations, including the refinancing transaction below. 
  On April 7, 2016, we drew on the EUR   468.8 million   (approximately US$   534.0 million   as at the transaction date) 2021 Euro Term Loan, the proceeds of which, together with cash on hand, were applied toward the repayment of the 2017 Term Loan plus accrued interest and the redemption and discharge of the 2017 PIK Notes plus accrued interest thereon. We also extended the maturity date of the 2018 Euro Term Loan by one year to November 1, 2018. In addition, we amended the interest rate applicable to amounts drawn on the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility such that interest is determined on the basis of our net leverage ratio (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) and ranges from 10.0% (if our net leverage ratio is greater than or equal to seven times) to   7.0%   per annum (if our net leverage ratio is less than   five   times); and extended the maturity date of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility to February 19, 2021, with a borrowing capacity of US$ 50.0 million with effect from January 1, 2018. Following these transactions, our nearest debt maturity is November 1, 2018 and our cost of borrowing has decreased. 
  We are continuing to take actions to conserve cash, including targeted reductions to our operating cost base through cost optimization programs, with the intention of allocating any excess cash, including in respect of common stock warrant exercises, towards substantially repaying the 2018 Euro Term Loan when it matures in November 2018. In this respect, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we paid US$ 27.5 million of previously accrued Guarantee Fees. We plan to pay the Guarantee Fee related to the 2018 Euro Term Loan in cash when it is due in November 2016. Further, we intend to make all future payments of the Guarantee Fees related to the 2018 Euro Term Loan in cash when due, rather than electing to pay in kind. We believe we have adequate cash resources to continue operating as a going concern. 
  Credit ratings and future debt issuances 
  Our corporate credit is rated   B2   by Moody's Investors Service and   B+   by Standard   Poor's, both with   stable   outlook. Ratings agencies have indicated that retention of these ratings is dependent on maintaining an adequate liquidity profile. If we fail to meet this liquidity parameter, it is likely that the rating agencies will downgrade us. The availability of additional liquidity is dependent upon our continued operating performance, improved financial performance and credit ratings. We are currently able to raise only a limited amount of additional debt (other than refinancing indebtedness) or under the agreements for the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility and the Reimbursement Agreement. 
  Credit risk of financial counterparties 
  We have entered into a number of significant contracts with financial counterparties as follows: 
  Interest Rate Swaps 
  We are party to interest rate swap agreements to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our Euro Term Loans. These interest rate swaps, designated as cash flow hedges, provide the Company with variable-rate cash receipts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the lives of the agreements, with no exchange of the underlying notional amount. 
  Foreign Exchange Forwards 
  We are exposed to movements in the USD to EUR exchange rates related to contractual payments under dollar-denominated agreements. To reduce this exposure, from time to time we enter into pay-Euro receive-dollar forward foreign exchange contracts. As at   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding   three   forward foreign exchange contracts with aggregate notional amounts of approximately US$   28.3 million   related to contractual operating payments. 
  Cash Deposits 
  We deposit cash in the global money markets with a range of bank counterparties and review the counterparties we choose weekly. The maximum period of deposit is three months but we have more recently held amounts on deposit for shorter periods, from overnight to one month. The credit rating of a bank is a critical factor in determining the size of cash deposits and we will only deposit cash with banks of an investment rating of A or A3 or higher. In addition we also closely monitor the credit default swap spreads and other market information for each of the banks with which we consider depositing or have deposited funds. 
   
  IV (e)    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  None. 
   
  V.    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our accounting policies that have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations are more fully described in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on   February 22, 2016  . The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates, which inherently contain some degree of uncertainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Using these estimates we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
  We believe our critical accounting policies are as follows: program rights, goodwill and intangible assets, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, revenue recognition, income taxes, foreign exchange, determination of the fair value of financial instruments, contingencies and discontinued operations. These critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. See Item 1,   Note 2, "Basis of Presentation"   for a discussion of accounting standards adopted in the period, and recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  We engage in activities that expose us to various market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not engage in speculative transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The table below sets forth our market risk sensitive instruments as at the following dates: 
  September 30, 2016  : 

(1)   
    As discussed in Item 1,   Note 4, "Long-term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements"  , as consideration for Time Warner's guarantee of the Euro Term Loans, we pay Guarantee Fees to Time Warner based on the amounts outstanding on the Euro Term Loans, each calculated such that the all-in borrowing rate on each the 2018 Euro Term Loan and the 2019 Euro Term Loan is 8.5% per annum and the all-in borrowing rate on the 2021 Euro Term Loan is 10.0% per annum. 
               (2)   
    The interest rate swaps maturing in 2018 are forward starting to coincide with the maturity date of the interest rate swaps maturing in 2017. See Item 1,   Note 11, "Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements"  . 
     December 31, 2015  : 

(1)   
    As discussed in Item 1,   Note 4, "Long-term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements"  , as consideration for Time Warner's guarantee of the Euro Term Loans, we pay Guarantee Fees to Time Warner based on the amounts outstanding on the 2018 Euro Term Loan and the 2019 Euro Term Loan, each calculated such that the all-in borrowing rate on each is 8.5%. 
     Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Management 
  We conduct business in a number of currencies other than our functional currencies. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk due to the effects that foreign exchange rate movements of these currencies have on our costs and on the cash flows we receive from our subsidiaries. In limited instances, including the transactions noted below, we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to minimize foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
  On December 3, 2015, we entered into two forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to movements in the USD to EUR exchange rates related to contractual payments under dollar-denominated agreements to be made during 2016. At   September 30, 2016  , forward foreign exchange contracts with aggregate notional amount of approximately US$   $10.6 million   were outstanding. 
  On February 11, 2016, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to movements in the USD to EUR exchange rates related to contractual payments under dollar-denominated agreements to be made during 2016. At   September 30, 2016  , forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately US$   17.7 million   were outstanding. 
  On February 17, 2016, we entered into five USD to EUR forward exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of US$ 557.0 million, to reduce our exposure to USD to EUR exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the refinancing of the dollar-denominated 2017 PIK Notes and 2017 Term Loan with the 2021 Euro Term Loan. The forwards were settled on April 7, 2016. 
  Interest Rate Risk Management 
  The Euro Term Loans each bear interest at a variable rate based on EURIBOR plus an applicable margin. We are party to a number of interest rate swap agreements intended to reduce our exposure to interest rate movements (see Item 1,   Note 11, "Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements"  ).

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
  We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including the co-Principal Executive Officers and the Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Our co-Principal Executive Officers and our Principal Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016   and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II.    OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.    Legal Proceedings 
  General 
  We are from time to time party to legal proceedings, arbitrations and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of our business operations. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in such matters and provide accruals for such matters, as appropriate. In making such decisions, we consider the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of a loss. An unfavorable outcome in any such proceedings, if material, could have an adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial statements.  
   
  Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
  This report and the following discussion of risk factors contain forward-looking statements as discussed in Part 1, Item 2, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also become important factors that affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Risks Relating to Our Financial Position 
  Global or regional economic conditions and the credit crisis have adversely affected our financial position and results of operations. We cannot predict if the recovery in our operating countries will continue or how long it may last. A failure to achieve lasting recoveries will continue to adversely affect our results of operations. 
  The results of our operations depend heavily on advertising revenue, and demand for advertising is affected by general economic conditions in the region and globally. The economic uncertainty affecting the global financial markets and banking system at the beginning of 2009 following the onset of the global financial crisis had a sustained adverse impact on consumer and business spending, access to credit, liquidity, investment spending, asset values and employment rates. These adverse economic conditions had a material negative impact on advertising spending in our markets, which negatively impacted our advertising revenues in the periods that followed. Since 2014, our markets have experienced overall growth in real GDP (as adjusted for inflation) and advertising spending; however we cannot predict if the recovery that has begun will continue or how long it will last. Any significant deterioration of general economic conditions in our markets would have an adverse economic impact on our advertising revenues. In addition, although we believe the economies of the countries in which we operate and advertising intensity (the ratio of total advertising spend per capita to nominal GDP per capita) will converge with developed nations, such convergence may not occur in the time frame we expect, or at all. Moreover, the occurrence of disasters, acts of terrorism, civil or military conflicts or general political instability and responses to it, such as the imposition of economic sanctions against Russia, may also cause a deterioration in general economic conditions that may reduce advertising spending. Any of these developments would have a significant negative effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Concerns regarding the Eurozone and the impact on the region of the outcome of the United Kingdom s referendum to exit from the European Union ( EU ) may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. 
  Continued economic softness in the Eurozone, including a slowdown in the growth of consumer prices, prompted the European Central Bank to embark upon quantitative easing in 2015. Economic events related to the sovereign debt crisis in several EU countries have also highlighted issues relating to the strength of the banking sector in Europe and the Euro. Though the EU has created external funding and stability mechanisms to provide liquidity and financial assistance to Eurozone member states and financial institutions, there can be no assurance that the market disruptions in Europe related to sovereign debt and the banking sector or otherwise, including the increased cost of funding for certain governments and financial institutions, will not continue and there can be no assurance that funding and stability packages utilized previously will be available or, if provided, will be sufficient to stabilize affected economies or institutions.  
  Economic conditions in the EU will be further impacted by the results of the referendum held in the United Kingdom on June 23, 2016 whereby the United Kingdom electorate voted in favor of the United Kingdom leaving the EU, commonly referred to as  Brexit . While the overall economic impact of Brexit on the EU and the Euro is difficult to estimate at present, decisions to conserve cash and reduce spending by consumers and businesses in the United Kingdom would have a negative impact on economic growth rates in the United Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, in the EU, in particular those countries that are significant exporters to the United Kingdom. There is also significant uncertainty regarding the timing and terms on which the United Kingdom would leave the EU, and it is expected that a more protracted process to set those terms would have a more prolonged economic impact. In addition, there is concern that other countries may seek to leave the EU following the Brexit decision, increasing uncertainty in the region, which may have a further negative impact on investment and economic growth rates. Furthermore, the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU may affect the budgetary contributions and allocations among the EU member states in the medium term, including the countries in which we operate, which are net recipients of EU funding. Economic uncertainty caused by Brexit or other instability in the EU could cause significant volatility in EU markets and reduce economic growth rates in the countries in which we operate, which would negatively impact our business.

     Index  

Our operating results will be adversely affected if we cannot generate strong advertising sales. 
  We generate the majority of our revenues from the sale of advertising airtime on our television channels. The reduction in advertising spending in our markets following the onset of the global financial crisis at the beginning of 2009 and the sustained recessionary period that followed had a negative effect on television advertising prices. While we have attempted to combat this fall in prices by implementing new pricing strategies, the success of these strategies has varied from market to market and continues to be challenged by pressure from advertisers and discounting by competitors. In addition to advertising pricing, other factors that may affect our advertising sales include general economic conditions (described above), competition from other broadcasters and operators of other distribution platforms, changes in programming strategy, changes in distribution strategy, our channels  technical reach, technological developments relating to media and broadcasting, seasonal trends in the advertising market, changing audience preferences and in how and when people view content and the accompanying advertising, increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and shifts in population and other demographics. Our advertising revenues also depend on our ability to maintain audience ratings and to generate GRPs. This requires us to have a distribution strategy that reaches a significant audience as well as maintaining investments in programming at a sufficient level to continue to attract audiences. Changes in the distribution of our channels, such as our decision not to broadcast in DTT in the Slovak Republic, may reduce the number of people who can view our channels, which may negatively impact our audience share and GRPs generated. Furthermore, significant or sustained reductions in investments in programming or other operating costs in response to reduced advertising revenues had and, if continued or repeated, may have an adverse impact on our television viewing levels. Reductions in advertising spending in our markets, resistance to price increases and discounting of television advertising prices as well as competition for ratings from broadcasters seeking to attract similar audiences have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain our advertising sales. A failure to maintain and increase advertising sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Fluctuations in exchange rates may continue to adversely affect our results of operations. 
  Our reporting currency is the dollar and CME Ltd.'s functional currency is the Euro. Our consolidated revenues and costs are divided across a range of European currencies. The strengthening of the dollar had a negative impact on reported revenues in 2015 when translated from the functional currencies of our operations. While we expect our revenues will continue to increase in 2016 in our operating currencies, a strong dollar would have a negative impact on our reported revenues. Furthermore, fluctuations in exchange rates may negatively impact programming costs. While local programming is generally purchased in local currencies, a significant portion of our content costs relate to foreign programming purchased pursuant to dollar-denominated agreements. If the dollar appreciates against the functional currencies of our operating segments, the cost of acquiring such content would be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. 
  Our liquidity constraints and debt service obligations may restrict our ability to fund our operations. 
  We have significant debt service obligations under the Euro Term Loans as well as the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility (when drawn). Furthermore, we are paying Guarantee Fees to Time Warner as consideration for its guarantees of the Euro Term Loans (collectively, the "TW Guarantees"). Although the entire Guarantee Fee in respect of the 2018 Euro Term Loan and the 2019 Euro Term Loan are, and a portion of the Guarantee Fee in respect of the 2021 Euro Term Loan can be, non-cash pay at our option, accruing such fees will further increase the amounts to be repaid at the maturity of these facilities. Accordingly, the payment of Guarantee Fees in kind will increase our already significant leverage. As a result of our debt service obligations and covenants contained in the related loan agreements, we are restricted under the Reimbursement Agreement and the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility (when drawn) in the manner in which our business is conducted, including but not limited to our ability to obtain additional debt financing to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, business opportunities or other corporate requirements. We may have a proportionally higher level of debt than our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, economic conditions and our industry. For additional information regarding the Reimbursement Agreement and the TW Guarantees, see Part I, Item I,   Note 4, "Long-term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements"  . 
  We may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness and may not be able to obtain favorable refinancing terms. 
  We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and we face the risk that we will not be able to renew, repay or refinance our indebtedness when due, or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be on better terms than those of such indebtedness being refinanced. Under the Reimbursement Agreement and the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility (when drawn), we can incur only limited amounts of additional indebtedness, other than indebtedness incurred to refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement, the all-in rates on the 2021 Euro Term Loan and the 2018 Euro Term Loan increase to 13% and 11%, respectively, on the date that is 180 days following a change of control (as defined therein); and pursuant to the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, all commitments terminate following a change of control (as defined therein) and the interest rate on amounts outstanding increases to 13% on the date that is 180 days following such change of control. In the event we are not able to refinance our indebtedness, we might be forced to dispose of assets on disadvantageous terms or reduce or suspend operations, any of which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  We may be subject to changes in tax rates and exposure to additional tax liabilities. 
  We are subject to taxes in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including in respect of our operations as well as capital transactions undertaken by us. We are subject to regular review and audit by tax authorities, and in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for taxes. The final determination of our tax liabilities resulting from tax audits, related proceedings or otherwise could be materially different from our tax provisions. Economic and political pressures to increase receipts in various jurisdictions may make taxation and tax rates subject to significant change and the satisfactory resolution of any tax disputes more difficult. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  A default by us in connection with our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness could result in our inability to continue to conduct our business. 
  Pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing the Reimbursement Agreement and the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, we pledged all of the shares of CME NV and of CME BV, which together own substantially all of the interests in our operating subsidiaries, as security for this indebtedness. If we or these subsidiaries were to default under the terms of any of the relevant indentures or agreements, the secured parties under such indentures and agreements would have the ability to sell all or a portion of the assets pledged to them in order to pay amounts outstanding under such debt instruments. This could result in our inability to conduct our business.

     Index  

Our strategies to enhance our carriage fees and diversify our revenues may not be successful. 
  We are focused on creating additional revenue streams from our broadcast operations as well as increasing revenues generated from broadcast advertising, which is how we generate most of our revenues. Our main efforts with respect to this strategy are on increasing carriage fees from cable and satellite operators for carriage of our channels as well as continuing to seek improvements in advertising pricing. Agreements with operators generally have a term of several years, at which time agreements must be renewed. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in renewing carriage fee agreements on similar or better terms. During prior negotiations to implement our carriage fees strategy, some cable and satellite operators suspended the broadcast of our channels, which negatively affected the reach and audience shares of those operations and as a result, advertising revenues. There is a risk that operators may refuse to carry our channels while carriage fee negotiations are ongoing, which may result in clients withdrawing advertising from our channels. The occurrence of any of these events may have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we are ineffective in negotiations with carriers or in achieving further carriage fee increases, our profitability will continue to be dependent primarily on television advertising revenues, which increases the importance placed on our ability to improve advertising pricing and generate advertising revenues. In addition to carriage fees, we are also working to build-out our offerings of advertising video-on-demand products and other opportunities for advertising online. There can be no assurances that our revenue diversification initiatives will ultimately be successful, and if unsuccessful, this may have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  A downgrading of our ratings may adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing. 
  Moody s Investors Service rates our corporate credit as   B2   with a   stable   outlook. Standard   Poor s rates our corporate credit   B+   with a   stable   outlook. These ratings reflect each agency s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations as they become due. Credit rating agencies view liquidity and the key ratios associated with it, such as gross leverage ratio, as a particular priority. We may be subject to downgrades if we fail to maintain adequate levels of liquidity. In the event our debt or corporate credit ratings are lowered by the rating agencies, it will be more difficult for us to refinance our existing indebtedness or raise new indebtedness that may be permitted under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility (when drawn) and the Reimbursement Agreement, and we will have to pay higher interest rates, which would have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  If our goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record significant charges to earnings. 
  We review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are required to be assessed for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or long-lived assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates in our markets, reduced expected future cash flows, increased country risk premium as a result of political uncertainty and a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We consider available current information when calculating our impairment charge. If there are indicators of impairment, our long-term cash flow forecasts for our operations deteriorate or discount rates increase, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in later periods. See Part I, Item I,   Note 3, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets"   for the carrying amounts of goodwill in each of our reporting units. 
  Changes to our business could result in future costs or charges. 
  We periodically adjust our business strategy in response to particular events and circumstances, including economic conditions, industry changes and technological developments. In connection with the implementation of new strategies, we may decide to restructure certain of our operations, businesses or assets in order to optimize our cost structure and capture operating efficiencies. Such events in the future could result in restructuring and other charges and the incurrence of additional costs or may require significant management time to implement. If any such charges are material, they could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. 
  Risks Relating to Our Operations 
  Content may become more expensive to produce or acquire or we may not be able to develop or acquire content that is attractive to our audiences. 
  Television programming is one of the most significant components of our operating costs. The ability of our programming to generate advertising revenues depends substantially on our ability to develop, produce or acquire programming that matches audience tastes and attracts high audience shares, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of a program depends on several tangible and intangible factors, including the impact of competing programs, the availability of alternate forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behavior, and general economic conditions. While we have been successful in reducing content costs compared to prior periods, the cost of acquiring content attractive to our viewers, such as feature films and popular television series and formats, may increase in the future. Our expenditures in respect of locally produced programming may also increase due to competition for talent and other resources, changes in audience tastes in our markets or from the implementation of any new laws and regulations mandating the broadcast of a greater number of locally produced programs. In addition, we typically acquire syndicated programming rights under multi-year commitments before knowing how such programming will perform in our markets. In the event any such programming does not attract adequate audience share, it may be necessary to increase our expenditures by investing in additional programming, subject to the availability of adequate financial resources, as well as to write down the value of any underperforming programming. Any material increase in content costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

     Index  

Our operations are vulnerable to significant changes in viewing habits and technology that could adversely affect us. 
  The television broadcasting industry is affected by rapid innovations in technology. The implementation of these new technologies and the introduction of non-traditional content distribution systems have increased competition for audiences and advertisers. Platforms such as direct-to-home cable and satellite distribution systems, the Internet, subscription and advertising video-on-demand, user-generated content sites and the availability of content on portable digital devices have changed consumer behavior by increasing the number of entertainment choices available to audiences and the methods for the distribution, storage and consumption of content. This development has fragmented television audiences in more developed markets and could adversely affect our ability to retain audience share and attract advertisers as such technologies penetrate our markets. As we adapt to changing viewing patterns, it may be necessary to expend substantial financial and managerial resources to ensure necessary access to new technologies or distribution systems. Such initiatives may not develop into profitable business models. Furthermore, technologies that enable viewers to choose when, how, where and what content to watch, as well as to fast-forward or skip advertisements, may cause changes in consumer behavior that could have a negative impact on our advertising revenues. In addition, compression techniques and other technological developments allow for an increase in the number of channels that may be broadcast in our markets and expanded programming offerings that may be offered to highly targeted audiences. Reductions in the cost of launching new channels could lower entry barriers and encourage the development of increasingly targeted niche programming on various distribution platforms. This could increase the competitive demand for popular programming, resulting in an increase in content costs as we compete for audiences and advertising revenues. A failure to successfully adapt to changes in our industry as a result of technological advances may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Our operating results are dependent on the importance of television as an advertising medium. 
  We generate most of our revenues from the sale of our advertising airtime on television channels in our markets. Television competes with various other media, such as print, radio, the internet and outdoor advertising, for advertising spending. In all of the countries in which we operate, television constitutes the single largest component of all advertising spending. There can be no assurances that the television advertising market will maintain its current position among advertising media in our markets. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that changes in the regulatory environment or improvements in technology will not favor other advertising media or other television broadcasters. Increases in competition among advertising media arising from the development of new forms of advertising media and distribution could result in a decline in the appeal of television as an advertising medium generally or of our channels specifically. A decline in television advertising spending as a component of total advertising spending in any period or in specific markets would have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  We are subject to legal compliance risks and the risk of legal or regulatory proceedings being initiated against us. 
  We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and other regulatory obligations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and compliance by our businesses is subject to scrutiny by regulators and other government authorities in these jurisdictions. Compliance with foreign as well as applicable U.S. laws and regulations related to our businesses, such as broadcasting content and advertising regulations, competition regulations, tax laws, employment laws, data protection requirements, and anti-corruption laws, increases the costs and risks of doing business in these jurisdictions. We believe we have implemented appropriate risk management and compliance policies and procedures that are designed to ensure our employees, contractors and agents comply with these laws and regulations; however, a violation of such laws and regulations or the Company s policies and procedures could occur. In addition, a failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, whether inadvertent or otherwise, may result in legal or regulatory proceedings. We have become aware of provisions in the tax regulations of one of our markets that shift the liability for taxes on gains resulting from certain capital transactions from the seller to the buyer. This provision may have been applicable to an acquisition made by us, although we do not believe we have any liability connected to this transaction. In addition, the prosecuting authorities in Romania have requested information in respect of an investigation into certain transactions entered into by Pro TV in 2014 primarily with certain related parties. We believe that the transactions under review are fully supported and are cooperating with the authorities in responding to the information request. However, these or other contingencies may result in legal or regulatory proceedings being initiated against us. Any such legal and regulatory proceedings or developments in respect of our compliance with, or changes in the interpretation or application of, existing laws or regulations, may require us to incur substantial costs, cause us to change our business practices, damage our reputation or expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, including fines and other penalties that may be substantial. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Piracy of our content may decrease revenues we can earn from our content and adversely impact our business and profitability. 
  Piracy of our content poses significant challenges in our markets. Technological developments, including digital copying, file compressing, the use of international proxies and the growing penetration of high bandwidth internet connections, have made it easier to create, transmit and distribute high quality unauthorized copies of content in unprotected digital formats. Furthermore, there are a growing number of video streaming sites, increasing the risk of online transmission of our content without consent. The proliferation of such sites broadcasting content pirated from us could result in a reduction of revenues that we receive from the legitimate distribution of our content, including through video-on-demand and other services. Protection of our intellectual property is in large part dependent on the manner in which applicable intellectual property laws in the countries in which we operate are construed and enforced. We seek to limit the threat of content piracy. However, detecting and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is often difficult and remedies may be limited under applicable law. Steps we take may not prevent the infringement by third parties. There can be no assurance that our efforts to enforce our rights and protect our intellectual property will be successful in preventing piracy, which limits our ability to generate revenues from our content. 
  Our operations are in developing markets where there are additional risks related to political and economic uncertainty, biased treatment and compliance with evolving legal and regulatory systems. 
  Our revenue-generating operations are located in Central and Eastern Europe and we may be significantly affected by risks that may be different to those posed by investments in more developed markets. These risks include, but are not limited to, social and political instability, inconsistent regulatory or judicial practice, and increased taxes and other costs. The economic and political systems, legal and tax regimes, regulatory practices, standards of corporate governance and business practices of countries in this region continue to develop. Policies and practices may be subject to significant adjustments, including following changes in political leadership. This may result in social or political instability or disruptions and the potential for political influence on the media as well as inconsistent application of tax and legal regulations, arbitrary treatment before regulatory or judicial authorities and other general business risks. Other potential risks inherent in markets with evolving economic and political environments include exchange controls, higher taxes, tariffs and other levies as well as longer payment cycles. The relative level of development of our markets and the influence of local politics also present a potential for biased treatment of us before regulators or courts in the event of disputes. If such a dispute occurs, those regulators or courts might favor local interests over our interests. Ultimately, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

     Index  

We may not be aware of all related party transactions, which may involve risks of conflicts of interest and result in transactions being concluded on less favorable terms than could be obtained in arm s-length transactions. 
  In our markets, the officers, general directors, other members of management or employees of our operating companies may have other business interests, including interests in television and other media-related companies. We may not be aware of all business interests or relationships that exist with respect to entities with which our operating companies enter into transactions. Transactions with related parties, whether or not we are aware of any such relationships between our employees and third parties, may present conflicts of interest and may result in the conclusion of transactions on terms that are not arm s-length. It is likely that we and our subsidiaries will continue to enter into related party transactions in the future. In the event there are transactions with persons who subsequently are determined to be related parties or affiliates, we may be required to make additional disclosure and, if such contracts are material, may not be in compliance with certain covenants under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility (when drawn) or the Reimbursement Agreement. Any related party transaction that is entered into on terms that are not arm s-length may result in a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  We rely on network and information systems and other technology that may be subject to disruption or misuse, which could harm our business or our reputation. 
  We make extensive use of network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our internal network management as well as our broadcasting operations. These systems are central to many of our business activities. Network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, malicious activities or other security breaches could result in a disruption or degradation of our services, the loss of information or the improper disclosure of personal data. The occurrence of any of these events could negatively impact our business by requiring us to expend resources to remedy such a security breach or by harming our reputation. In addition, improper disclosure of personal data could subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data in the countries in which we operate. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent these events from occurring requires ongoing monitoring and updating as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. As technologies evolve, we will need to expend additional resources to protect our technology and information systems, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
  Our broadcasting licenses may not be renewed and may be subject to revocation. 
  We require broadcasting and, in some cases, other operating licenses as well as other authorizations from national regulatory authorities in our markets in order to conduct our broadcasting business. While our broadcasting licenses for our operations in Slovenia and the Slovak Republic are valid for indefinite time periods, our other broadcasting licenses expire at various times through 2028. While we expect that our material licenses and authorizations will be renewed or extended as required to continue to operate our business, we cannot guarantee that this will occur or that they will not be subject to revocation, particularly in markets where there is relatively greater political risk as a result of less developed political and legal institutions. The failure to comply in all material respects with the terms of broadcasting licenses or other authorizations or with applications filed in respect thereto may result in such licenses or other authorizations not being renewed or otherwise being terminated. Furthermore, no assurances can be given that renewals or extensions of existing licenses will be issued on the same terms as existing licenses or that further restrictions or conditions will not be imposed in the future. Any non-renewal or termination of any other broadcasting or operating licenses or other authorizations or material modification of the terms of any renewed licenses may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Our success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel. 
  Our success depends partly upon the efforts and abilities of our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Our management teams have significant experience in the media industry and have made important contributions to our growth and success. Although we have been successful in attracting and retaining such people in the past, competition for highly skilled individuals is intense. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining such individuals in the future. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Risks Relating to Enforcement Rights 
  We are a Bermuda company and enforcement of civil liabilities and judgments may be difficult. 
  We are a Bermuda company. Substantially all of our assets and all of our operations are located, and all of our revenues are derived, outside the United States. In addition, several of our directors and officers are non-residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are or may be located outside the United States. As a result, investors may be unable to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons, or to enforce against them judgments obtained in the United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and state securities laws. There is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Bermuda and the countries in which we operate would enforce (a) judgments of United States courts obtained against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and state securities laws or (b) in original actions brought in such countries, liabilities against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws. 
  Our Bye-laws restrict shareholders from bringing legal action against our officers and directors. 
  Our Bye-laws contain a broad waiver by our shareholders of any claim or right of action in Bermuda, both individually and on our behalf, against any of our officers or directors. The waiver applies to any action taken or concurred in by an officer or director, or the failure of an officer or director to take any action, in the performance of his or her duties, except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the officer or director. This waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our officers and directors unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty.

     Index  

Risks Relating to our Common Stock 
  Our share price may be adversely affected by sales of unregistered shares or future issuances of our shares. 
  Time Warner is the largest holder of shares of our Class A common stock, holding   61,407,775   unregistered shares of Class A common stock, one share of Series A preferred stock, 200,000 shares of Series B preferred stock and warrants to acquire   100,926,996   shares of our Class A common stock (the "TW Warrants"). The share of Series A preferred stock is convertible into   11,211,449   shares of Class A common stock and the shares of Series B preferred stock are convertible into shares of Class A common stock at the option of Time Warner (subject to certain exceptions). As of   September 30, 2016  , the 200,000 shares of Series B preferred stock were convertible into approximately   104.2 million   shares of Class A common stock. The TW Warrants are exercisable for shares of Class A common stock until May 2, 2018 at an exercise price of US$ 1.00 per share. Time Warner has registration rights with respect to all its shares of Class A common stock now held or hereafter acquired. Furthermore, there are additional unregistered shares of our Class A common stock outstanding that we may be obligated to register and shares of Class A common stock underlying other warrants that may enter into trading. For additional information on the Series A preferred stock, Series B preferred stock and TW Warrants, see Part I, Item I,   Note 12, "Convertible Redeemable Preferred Shares"   and   Note 13, "Equity"  . 
  We cannot predict what effect, if any, the entry into trading of previously issued unregistered shares of Class A common stock will have on the market price of our shares. We may also issue additional shares of Class A common stock or securities convertible into our equity in the future. If more shares of our Class A common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our Class A common stock) are issued to Time Warner, the economic interests of current shareholders may be diluted and the price of our shares may be adversely affected. 
  The interests of Time Warner may conflict with the interests of other investors. 
  Time Warner is able to exercise voting power in us with respect to   47.3%   of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock. As such, Time Warner is in a position to exercise significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as the election of directors or certain transactions. Following the issuance of the TW Warrants, the aggregate economic interest of Time Warner in us is approximately   75.9%   (without giving effect to the accretion of the Series B preferred stock after   September 30, 2016  ). Furthermore, Time Warner has the right to appoint one less than the number required to constitute a majority of our board of directors, provided that Time Warner continues to own not less than 40% of the voting power of the Company. In addition, we are party to an amended investor rights agreement with Time Warner and the other parties thereto under which, among other things, Time Warner was granted a contractual preemptive right (subject to certain exclusions) with respect to issuances of the Company s equity securities, which permits it to maintain its pro rata economic interest as well as a right to top any offer that would result in a change of control of the Company. Under Bermuda law, there is no takeover code or similar legislation requiring an acquirer of a certain percentage of our Class A common stock to tender for the remaining publically held shares. In certain circumstances, the interests of Time Warner as our largest shareholder could be in conflict with the interests of minority shareholders. 
  Furthermore, in addition to being our largest shareholder, Time Warner is our largest secured creditor, as it guarantees 100% of our outstanding senior indebtedness and is the lender under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility and the Reimbursement Agreement contain maintenance covenants in respect of interest cover, cash flow cover and total leverage ratios and includes covenants in respect of the incurrence of indebtedness (including refinancing indebtedness), the provision of guarantees, acquisitions and disposal and granting security. As such, Time Warner may be in a position to determine whether to permit transactions, waive defaults or accelerate such indebtedness or take other steps in its capacity as a secured creditor in a manner that might not be consistent with the interests of the holders of our Class A common stock. 
  The price of our Class A common stock is likely to remain volatile. 
  The market price of shares of our Class A common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those described above under  Risks Relating to Our Operations  as well as the following: general economic and business trends, variations in quarterly operating results, license renewals, regulatory developments in our operating countries and the European Union, the condition of the media industry in our operating countries, the volume of trading in shares of our Class A common stock, future issuances of shares of our Class A common stock and investors  and securities analysts  perception of us and other companies that investors or securities analysts deem comparable in the television broadcasting industry. In addition, stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to and disproportionate to the operating performance of broadcasting companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of shares of our Class A common stock, regardless of our operating performance. 
  Our business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism. 
  On November 18, 2015, TCS Capital Management, LLC ("TCS Capital"), a beneficial owner of more than 10% of our shares, submitted a letter to the Board of Directors and filed a Schedule 13D disclosing its ownership interest. In recent years, shareholder activists, such as TCS Capital, have become involved in numerous public companies. Shareholder activists frequently propose to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of the Company. Such proposals may disrupt our business and divert the attention of our management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.

  CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. SECTION 1350 
  AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 906 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
    
  In connection with the Quarterly Report of Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (the  Company ) on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016  , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the  Report ), we, Michael Del Nin and Christoph Mainusch, co-Chief Executive Officers of the Company, and David Sturgeon, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:
