Financial Statement Presentation  

The condensed consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated
statement of changes in stockholders  equity as of September 30, 2016 and the related condensed consolidated statements of
(loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income, and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared by Company management. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal
recurring adjustments, except where noted) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows at September 30, 2016 and 2015 and for the periods then ended have been made. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America have been condensed or omitted. We recommend these condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s December 31, 2015 Annual Report to Shareholders
on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of operating results
for the entire year. 

The presentation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates and assumptions used in the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements are based upon management s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the time of the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Except to the extent updated or described below, the significant
accounting policies set forth in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015, appropriately represent, in all material respects, the current status of accounting policies,
and are incorporated herein by reference. 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss  

The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net
of tax, are as follows: 

The Company recognized $4,238,000 in foreign currency translation
losses within the income statement during the first quarter due to the substantial liquidation of our Austin Taylor facility in
the U.K. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the pension liability adjustment recognized in income in the first
quarter of 2016. 

NOTE 2   CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS 

The following tables show the Company s cash equivalents
and available-for-sale securities  amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value by significant
investment category recorded as cash and cash equivalents or short and long term investments as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015: 

The Company tests for other-than-temporary losses on a quarterly
basis and has considered the unrealized losses shown above to be temporary in nature. The Company intends to hold these investments
until it can recover the full principal amount and has the ability to do so based on its other sources of liquidity. The Company
expects these recoveries to occur prior to the contractual maturities. All unrealized losses as of September 30, 2016 were in a
continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and are not deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of
September 30, 2016. 

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our
investments, designated as available-for-sale and classified by the contractual maturity date of the securities as of September
30, 2016: 

The Company did not recognize any gross realized gains, and
gross realized losses were immaterial, during the three-month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If the
Company had realized gains or losses, they would be included within investment and other income in the accompanying consolidated
results of operations. 

NOTE 3 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan  

Under the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ),
employees are able to acquire shares of common stock at 85% of the price at the end of each current quarterly plan term. The most
recent term ended September 30, 2016. The ESPP is considered compensatory under current Internal Revenue Service rules. At September
30, 2016, after giving effect to the shares issued as of that date, 85,569 shares remain available for purchase under the ESPP. 

2011 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan  

On March 28, 2011 the Board adopted and on May 19, 2011 the
Company s shareholders approved the Company s 2011 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan ( 2011 Incentive Plan ).
The 2011 Incentive Plan authorizes incentive awards to officers, key employees and non-employee directors in the form of options
(incentive and non-qualified), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units ( deferred
stock ), performance cash units, and other awards in stock, cash, or a combination of stock and cash. The 2011 Incentive
Plan, as amended, allows the issuance of up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock. 

During 2016, stock options covering 325,968 shares have been
awarded to key executive employees and directors. These options expire seven years from the date of award and vest 25% each year
beginning one year after the date of award. The Company also granted deferred stock awards of 102,161 shares to key employees during
the first quarter of 2016 under the Company s long-term incentive plan for performance over the 2016 to 2018 period. The
actual number of shares of deferred stock, if any, that are ultimately earned by the respective employees will be determined based
on achievement against performance goals at the end of the three year period ending December 31, 2018 and any shares earned will
be issued in the first quarter of 2019 to those key employees still with the Company at that time. 

At September 30, 2016, 131,035 shares have been issued under
the 2011 Incentive Plan, 1,121,153 shares are subject to currently outstanding options, deferred stock awards, and unvested restricted
stock units, and 747,812 shares are eligible for grant under future awards. 

Stock Option Plan for Directors  

Shares of common stock are reserved for issuance to non-employee
directors under options granted by the Company prior to 2011 under its Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the  Director
Plan ). Under the Director Plan nonqualified stock options to acquire shares of common stock were automatically granted to
each non-employee director concurrent with annual meetings of shareholders in 2010 and earlier years, with the exercise price of
options granted being the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the respective shareholder meetings. Options granted
under the Director Plan expire 10 years from date of grant. No options were granted under the Director Plan in 2014 or 2015. The
Company amended the Director Plan in May 2011 to prohibit future option grants. As of September 30, 2016, there were 63,000 shares
subject to outstanding options under the Director Plan. 

1992 Stock Plan  

Under the Company s 1992 Stock Plan ( the Stock
Plan ), shares of common stock may be issued pursuant to stock options, restricted stock or deferred stock grants to officers
and key employees. Exercise prices of stock options under the Stock Plan cannot be less than fair market value of the stock on
the date of grant. Rules and conditions governing awards of stock options, restricted stock and deferred stock are determined by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, subject to limitations in the Stock Plan. The Company amended the Stock Plan
in 2011 to prohibit future stock options or other equity awards. 

At September 30, 2016, after reserving for stock options
and deferred stock awards granted in prior years and adjusting for forfeitures and issuances during the year, there were
10,230 shares reserved for issuance under the Stock Plan. The Company has not awarded stock options or deferred stock under
the Stock Plan since 2011. 

Changes in Stock Options Outstanding  

The following table summarizes changes in the number of outstanding
stock options under the 2011 Incentive Plan, the Director Plan and Stock Plan over the period December 31, 2015 to September 30,
2016: 

The aggregate intrinsic value of all options (the amount by
which the market price of the stock on the last day of the period exceeded the market price of the stock on the date of grant)
outstanding at September 30, 2016 was $0. The intrinsic value of all options exercised during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 was $0. Net cash proceeds from the exercise of all stock options were $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. 

Changes in Deferred Stock Outstanding  

The following table summarizes the changes in the number of
deferred stock shares under the Stock Plan and 2011 Incentive Plan over the period December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016: 

Changes
in Restricted Stock Units Outstanding   

The
following table summarizes the changes in the number of restricted stock units under the 2011 Incentive Plan over the period December
31, 2015 to September 30, 2016:  

Compensation
Expense   

Share-based
compensation expense recognized for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $505,000 before income taxes and $328,000
after income taxes. Share-based compensation expense recognized for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 was $701,000
before income taxes and $456,000 after income taxes. Unrecognized compensation expense for the Company s plans was $557,000
at September 30, 2016 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. Excess tax benefits from the
exercise of stock options and issuance of stock included in financing cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 were $ (63,000) and $ 88,000, respectively. Share-based compensation expense is recorded as a part of selling, general
and administrative expenses.  

NOTE
4 - INVENTORIES  

Inventories
summarized below are priced at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market:   

NOTE
5   ACQUISITION  

On
June 1, 2015, the Company acquired all of the shares of Twisted Technologies, Inc. ( Twisted Technologies ). The purchase
price was $1,463,000, with cash acquired totaling $83,000. The purchase price includes initial consideration of $1,000,000, deferred
consideration of $300,000 paid out on March 31, 2016, and $163,000 in estimated contingent consideration. The Company has agreed
to pay consideration contingent upon the Twisted Technologies business achieving specific revenue targets over a three-year period,
with the consideration to be paid after each annual period has lapsed. The Company has recognized $163,000 as the estimated fair
value of the contingent consideration at the date of acquisition. The maximum payout is not limited. At September 30, 2016, the
Company had estimated liabilities of $7,000 related to these outstanding contingent consideration payments.  

The
assets and liabilities of Twisted Technologies were recorded in the consolidated balance sheet within the JDL Technologies segment
at September 30, 2016. The purchase price allocation was based on estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed and included total assets of $1,591,000, including goodwill of $1,463,000, and total liabilities of $128,000. The entire
goodwill balance is deductible for tax purposes.  

12  

NOTE
6  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  

The
changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 by segment are as follows:  

The
Company s identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and were
as follows:   

13  

Amortization
expense on these identifiable intangible assets was $63,000 and $50,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amortization expense
is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. At  September 30, 2016 , the estimated
future amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets for the remainder of  2016  and
all of the following four fiscal years is as follows:  

NOTE
7   WARRANTY  

We
provide reserves for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. We estimate the costs of our
warranty obligations based on our warranty policy or applicable contractual warranty, historical experience of known product failure
rates, and use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures. Management reviews the estimated
warranty liability on a quarterly basis to determine its adequacy. The actual warranty expense could differ from the estimates
made by the Company based on product performance.  

The
following table presents the changes in the Company s warranty liability for the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, the majority of which relates to a five-year obligation to provide for potential future liabilities
for network equipment sales.   

NOTE
8   CONTINGENCIES  

In
the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to legal actions and claims and incurs costs to defend against these actions
and claims. Company management is not aware of any outstanding or pending legal actions or claims that could materially affect
the Company s financial position or results of operations.  

NOTE
9   DEBT  

Long-term
Debt   

The
mortgage on the Company s headquarters building was payable in monthly installments and carried an interest rate of 6.83%.
The mortgage matured on March 1, 2016 and the Company paid $104,000 in the first quarter of 2016 to fully settle the liability.
The mortgage was secured by the building.  

14  

Line
of Credit   

The
Company has a $15,000,000 line of credit from Wells Fargo Bank. The Company had no outstanding borrowings against the line of
credit at September 30, 2016. Due to the revolving nature of loans under our credit facility, additional borrowings and periodic
repayments and re-borrowings may be made until the maturity date. The total amount available for borrowings under our credit facility
at September 30, 2016 was $13,037,000, based on the borrowing base calculation. Interest on borrowings on the credit line is at
LIBOR plus 2.0% (2.5% at September 30, 2016). The credit agreement expires August 12, 2021 and is secured by assets of the Company.
Our credit agreement contains financial covenants including a minimum liquidity balance of $10,000,000. Liquidity is calculated
as the sum of unrestricted cash, marketable securities and the availability on the line of credit. At September 30, 2016, our
liquidity level was $25,814,000. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants at September 30, 2016.  

NOTE
10   INCOME TAXES  

In
the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements, management calculates income taxes based upon the estimated
effective rate applicable to operating results for the full fiscal year. This includes estimating the current tax liability as
well as assessing differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes. These differences
result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded on the balance sheet. Management analyzes these assets and liabilities
regularly and assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income.  

At
September 30, 2016 there was $229,000 of net uncertain tax benefit positions that would reduce the effective income tax rate if
recognized. The Company records interest and penalties related to income taxes as income tax expense in the Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Income.  

The
Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. The tax years
2012-2015 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and the years 2011-2015 remain open to examination by various
state tax departments. The tax years from 2012-2015 remain open in Costa Rica. In April 2016, we received notification from the
Internal Revenue Service that they would be performing an examination of our 2012 and 2013 federal consolidated income tax returns.
As of September 30, 2016, the examination was still in progress. We do not expect that any settlement or payment that may result
from the examination will have a material effect on our results of operations.  

The
Company s effective income tax rate was (4.0%) for the first nine months of 2016. The effective tax rate differs from the
federal tax rate of 35% due to state income taxes, foreign tax rate differences, foreign losses not deductible for U.S. income
tax purposes, provisions for interest charges for uncertain income tax positions, and changes in valuation allowances related
to deferred tax assets.  The foreign  operating losses may ultimately be deductible in the
countries in which they occurred; however the Company has not recorded a deferred tax asset for these losses due to uncertainty
regarding the eventual realization of the benefit. The effect of the foreign operations was an overall rate decrease of approximately
(6.6%) for the nine months ended  September 30, 2016 . The Company s effective income
tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was 43.3%, and differed from the federal tax rate due to state income taxes,
foreign tax rate differences, foreign losses not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes and provisions for interest charges for
uncertain income tax positions and the net impact of research and development credits.

NOTE
11   SEGMENT INFORMATION  

Effective
January 1, 2016, the Company realigned its business operations. As a result of the realignment, the Company has segregated its
Transition Networks subsidiary TN EMEA (now renamed Net2Edge) as a separate operating segment. Following this realignment, the
Company classifies its businesses into four segments as follows:  

Suttle
                                         manufactures and markets connectivity infrastructure products for broadband and voice
                                         communications;    

Transition
                                         Networks manufactures media converters, NIDs, NICs, Ethernet switches and other connectivity
                                         products that offer the ability to affordably integrate the benefits of fiber optics
                                         into any data network;    

JDL
                                         Technologies provides technology solutions including virtualization, managed services,
                                         wired and wireless network design and implementation, HIPAA-compliant IT services, and
                                         converged infrastructure configuration and deployment; and    

Net2Edge
                                         enables telecommunications carriers to connect legacy networks to high-speed services.    

Management
has chosen to organize the enterprise and disclose reportable segments based on our products and services. Intersegment revenues
are eliminated upon consolidation. T o conform to the 2016 presentation, the Company has reclassified
2015 segment information to present the Net2Edge business unit as a separate segment.   

Information
concerning the Company s continuing operations in the various segments for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 is as follows:

NOTE 12   PENSIONS 

The Company s U.K. based subsidiary Austin Taylor maintained
a defined benefit pension plan for its employees through March 31, 2016. The Company does not provide any other post-retirement
benefits to its employees. Components of net periodic benefit of the pension plans for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were: 

The Company settled all its obligations under pension plan in
the first quarter of 2016. The Company had contributed $650,000 toward the settlement of the pension into annuities in 2015, which
resulted in the recognition of $1,222,000 of pension settlement costs in the income statement in the fourth quarter of 2015. The
Company contributed an additional $68,000 toward the settlement in the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in a benefit of $43,000
recorded within operating expenses. As a result of the final settlement of all of its pension obligations, in the first quarter
of 2016, the Company recorded $4,148,000 in pension liability adjustment gains previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income within operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income. 

NOTE 13   NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE 

Basic net income per common share is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during each year. Diluted net income per common share takes into effect the dilutive effect
of potential common shares outstanding. The Company s only potential common shares outstanding are stock options and shares
associated with the long-term incentive compensation plans, which resulted in no dilutive effect for the three and nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2016. The Company calculates the dilutive effect of outstanding options using the treasury stock method.
Due to the net losses in the first three and nine-month periods of 2015, there was no dilutive impact from stock options or unvested
shares. Options totaling 964,563 and 846,584 were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 because the exercise price was greater than the average market price of common
stock during the period and deferred stock awards totaling 159,689 shares would not have been included for the three and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 because of unmet performance conditions. Options totaling 625,812 would have been excluded from
the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, because the exercise
price was greater than the average market price of common stock during the period and deferred stock awards totaling 192,061 shares
would not have been included for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015 because of unmet performance conditions. 

NOTE 14   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

The accounting guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy for
disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels
as follows: 

Level 1   Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted
prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2   Observable inputs such as quoted prices for
similar instruments and quoted prices in markets that are not active, and inputs that are directly observable or can be corroborated
by observable market data. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively
traded securities or contracts, such as treasury securities with pricing interpolated from recent trades of similar securities,
or priced with models using highly observable inputs, such as commodity options priced using observable forward prices and volatilities. 

Level 3   Significant inputs to pricing that have little
or no observability as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring
significant management judgment or estimation, such as the complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine the fair
value of financial instruments. 

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are summarized below: 

The estimated fair value of contingent consideration as of September
30, 2016 was $7,000, as noted above. The estimated fair value is considered a level 3 measurement because the probability weighted
discounted cash flow methodology used to estimate fair value includes the use of significant unobservable inputs, primarily the
contractual contingent consideration revenue targets and assumed probabilities. The change in the estimated contingent consideration
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted in a gain of $135,000 included in operating income. The gains were the
result of a change in future assumptions related to the contingent consideration.. 

We record transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy,
if necessary, at the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels during the three months ended September
30, 2016. 

NOTE 15   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date
of this filing. We do not believe there are any material subsequent events that would require further disclosure.

Forward-looking statements  

In this report and, from time to time, in reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), in press releases, and in other communications to shareholders or the investing public,
the Company may make  forward looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995 concerning possible or anticipated future financial performance, business activities, plans, pending claims, investigations
or litigation, which are typically preceded by the words  believes,   expects,   anticipates, 
 intends  or similar expressions. For these forward-looking statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe
harbor for forward-looking statements contained in federal securities laws. Shareholders and the investing public should understand
that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance, activities, anticipated
results, outcomes or plans to differ significantly from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties
include, but are not limited to: 

General Risks and Uncertainties: 

The ability of the CSI parent to oversee and ensure that
the Company s four operating units function in an efficient and cost-effective manner; 

21  

The ability of our four business units to operate profitably;
and 

The impact of changing economic circumstances on government
expenditures in our markets. 

Suttle Risks and Uncertainties: 

Suttle s dependence upon its sales to a small number
of major communication service providers and their continued investment and deployment into building out their networks; 

Volatility in purchases of Suttle s products by
major communication service providers as well as recent, increased pressure on our margins; and 

Suttle s ability to continue to introduce and sell
new fiber-network based-products such as G.hn products and FTTx (fiber-to-the-home or node) products to replace declining sales
and lower or fluctuating gross margins in its legacy products. 

Transition Networks Risks and Uncertainties: 

The ability of Transition Networks to develop and sell
new products for new and existing markets at a level adequate to counter the decline in sales from its traditional products; 

Transition Networks  ability to profitably penetrate
targeted international markets; and 

Transition Networks  reliance on contract manufacturers
and OEMs for supply of its products. 

JDL Technologies Risks and Uncertainties:

its traditional South Florida school district customers; 

JDL s ability to profitably increase its business
serving small and medium-sized commercial businesses, including profitably leveraging its June 1, 2015 acquisition of Twisted
Technologies; and 

JDL s ability to establish and maintain a productive
and efficient workforce given revenues that have historically fluctuated significantly from period to period, in part due to the
uncertainty and timing of federal government funding of school initiatives, including the E-Rate program. 

Net2Edge s Risks and Uncertainties: 

Net2Edge s ability to develop new products and
increase its revenues to cover its fixed and variable costs. 

In addition, the Company will discuss other factors from
time to time in its filings with the SEC, including risk factors presented under Item 1A of the Company s most recently filed annual
report on Form 10-K or quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

26  

The following table summarizes Transition Networks  2016 and 2015 first
nine month sales by its major product groups: 

Sales in North America increased 3% or $779,000 due mainly to improved activity
at a major carrier customer. International sales decreased $1,900,000, or 24%, due to weakened global economies and currency fluctuations,
which make our products more expensive in some countries. Sales of media converters decreased 1% or $118,000 due to product mix
as we transition to a newer platform. Sales of Ethernet switches and adapters decreased 21% or $1,633,000 due primarily to a slowdown
in the industrial sector internationally.

Technologies  sales to small and medium-sized commercial businesses (SMBs) increased $546,000, or 21% due to organic client
growth and the acquisition of Twisted Technologies in June of 2015. 

27  

Gross
margin increased 49% to $4,335,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $2,917,000 in the same period in 2015. Gross margin
as a percentage of sales increased to 35.1% in 2016 from 27.6% in 2015 due to sales mix.  Gross margin
as a percentage of 2015 sales was abnormally low due to low sales volume and relatively fixed overhead costs in the first quarter
of 2015.   Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 7% in 2016 to $2,531,000, or 20.5% of sales, compared
to $2,722,000, or 25.8% of sales, in 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as JDL Technologies made operational

Net2Edge
Results   

Net2Edge s
sales increased 34% to $1,434,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $1,073,000 in 2015 due to increased sales on its
new Liberator TM  product line. Gross margin increased 21% to $752,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $620,000
in the same period of 2015. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 52.4% in 2016 from 57.8% in 2015 due to product
mix from legacy products to new product lines. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2% in 2016 to $2,499,000
compared to $2,546,000 in 2015 due to an effort to control expenses. Net2Edge reported an operating loss of $1,747,000 in the
first nine months of 2016 compared to a loss of $1,926,000 in the same period of 2015.  

Other   

The
Company s loss before income taxes decreased to $6,032,000 in 2016 compared to $6,898,000 in 2015 due to an overall decrease
in sales and lower margins, offset partially by lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Additionally, the Company
recognized a net gain of $808,000, primarily due to the sale of the Austin Taylor facility and a foreign currency translation
loss of $4,238,000, due to the substantial liquidation of Austin Taylor within other expenses during the first quarter of 2016.
The Company s effective income tax rate was (4.0%) in 2016 and 43.3% in 2015. This effective tax rate for 2016 differs from
the federal tax rate of 35% due to state income taxes, foreign tax rate differences, foreign losses not deductible for U.S. income
tax purposes, provisions for interest charges for uncertain income tax positions, and changes in valuation allowances related
to deferred tax assets.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Significant working capital changes from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 included a decrease in accounts receivable of
$1,444,000 and a decrease in payables of $1,131,000.  

Net
cash provided by investing activities was $1,040,000 in 2016 and $806,000 in 2015, due to proceeds from the sale of investments
and a gain on the sale of assets, specifically the land and building of our Austin Taylor facility in the U.K. during the first
quarter of 2016.  

Net
cash used in financing activities was $4,644,000 in 2016 compared to $530,000 used in financing activities in 2015. Cash dividends
paid on common stock increased to $4,269,000 in 2016 ($0.48 per common share) from $4,221,000 in 2015. Proceeds from common stock
issuances, principally shares sold to the Company s Employee Stock Ownership Plan and issued under the Company s Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, totaled approximately $118,000 in 2016 and $272,000 in 2015. The Company did not repurchase any shares in
2016 or 2015 under the Board-authorized program. At September 30, 2016, Board of Director authority to purchase approximately
411,910 additional shares remained in effect. The Company acquired $26,000 and $179,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively, of Company
stock from employees to satisfy withholding tax obligations related to share-based compensation, pursuant to terms of Board and
shareholder-approved compensation plans.  

The

credit agreement expires August 12, 2021 and is secured by assets of the Company.  

In
the opinion of management, based on the Company s current financial and operating position and projected future expenditures,
sufficient funds are available to meet the Company s anticipated operating and capital expenditure needs  .

critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are discussed in our 2015 Form 10-K in
Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no significant
changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
Company s accounting policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and disclose matters such as allowance
for doubtful accounts, sales returns, inventory valuation, warranty expense, income taxes, revenue recognition, asset impairment
recognition and foreign currency translation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Results
may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. Management
reviews these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standard update on revenue recognition from
contracts with customers. The new guidance will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific
guidance. According to the new guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. As a result
of the FASB s July 2015 deferral of the standard s required implementation date, the guidance is effective for interim
and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this
standard on its consolidated financial statements.  

In April 2015, the
FASB issued accounting guidance that changes the presentation of debt issuance costs. The core principle of this revised accounting
guidance is that debt issuance costs are not assets, but adjustments to the carrying cost of debt. The Company adopted this guidance
in the first quarter of 2016 with no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard on inventory, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by requiring
entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventory measured using the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) or the retail inventory methods. This standard requires entities to compare the cost of inventory to one measure  
net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The standard is effective for the annual period beginning after
December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied prospectively.
The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

In November 2015,
the FASB issued an accounting standard on deferred taxes, which removes the requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities
as current and noncurrent on the balance sheet based on the classification of the related asset or liability, and instead requires
classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This guidance will be effective for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. Other than the prescribed classification
of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent, the Company does not expect the implementation of this standard to have
a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements regarding accounting for leases, which requires an entity to recognize
both assets and liabilities arising from financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting
period, and early adoption is permitted. We have not yet determined the potential effects on our financial condition or results
of operations.  

30  

In March 2016, the
FASB issued a new accounting standard that will change certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees, including
the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement
of cash flows. The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We have not yet
determined the impact this standard will have on our financial condition or results of operations.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance regarding the classification of cash receipts and payments in the Statement
of Cash Flows. This guidance is  intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts
and cash payments are presented and classified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows by providing guidance on eight specific
cash flow issues. The new standard is effective retrospectively on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  We have
not yet determined the impact this standard will have on our financial condition or results of operations.  

Item
3 .        Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk .   

The
Company has no freestanding or embedded derivatives. The Company s policy is to not use freestanding derivatives and to
not enter into contracts with terms that cannot be designated as normal purchases or sales.  

The
vast majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars; as such, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have
historically not been material to the Company. At September 30, 2016 our bank line of credit carried a variable interest rate
based on LIBOR plus 2.0%.  

Based
on the Company s operations, in the opinion of management, no material future losses or exposure exist relative to market
risk.  

Item
4 .        Controls
and Procedures    

The
Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s
 disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  

Except
as set forth below, there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we implemented a new ERP system within our JDL Technologies, Inc. business unit. The system
changes were not being made in response to any material weakness in our internal controls. This implementation has resulted in
some changes to business processes and internal control over financial reporting. We have taken steps to monitor and maintain
appropriate internal control over financial reporting and will continue to evaluate the operating effectiveness of related controls
during future periods.

RECITALS

modified from time to time, the   Credit Agreement  ). Capitalized terms used in these Recitals have the meanings
given to them in the Credit Agreement unless otherwise specified. 

Borrowers have requested
that Lender agree to amend the Credit Agreement, and Lender is willing to grant Borrowers  request pursuant to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Amendment. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, it is agreed as follows: 

1.          Defined
Terms . Capitalized terms used in this Amendment which are defined in the Credit Agreement shall have the same meanings
set forth therein, unless otherwise defined herein. 

2.          Amendments
to Credit Agreement . 

(a)         Section
1.1(b)(x) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 

(x)          (i)
that portion of any Account owing from an Account Debtor (other than KGP Telecommunications and Tech Data Corporation) or its Affiliates

or any other requirement set forth in the Security Agreements, so long as (a) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing

 PRESS RELEASE DATED NOVEMBER 3, 2016

Exhibit 99.1   

FOR
IMMEDIATE RELEASE    

COMMUNICATIONS
SYSTEMS, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2016 FINANCIAL RESULTS    

Minnetonka,
MN   November 3, 2016   Communications Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: JCS) ( CSI  or the  Company ) ,
a global provider of connectivity infrastructure and services for deployments of broadband networks, today announced financial
results for the third quarter ( Q3 ) ended September 30, 2016, including a discussion of results of operations by
segment.  

Third
Quarter 2016 Summary    

CSI s
                                         manufacturing business units registered strong new product sales 1  growth in
                                         Q3 2016.    

Suttle s
                                         new product sales increased 36% year over year to $3.4 million.    

Transition
                                         Networks  new product sales rose 118% year over year to $3.0 million.    

Q3
                                         2016 consolidated operating loss was $1.2 million compared to operating income of $0.4
                                         million in Q3 2015, primarily driven by a $2.6 million operating loss at Suttle as a
                                         result of declining legacy product sales volumes and pricing.    

Transition
                                         Networks recorded a signficant improvement in operating income, which grew 80% to $1.6
                                         million from $0.9 million in Q3 2015, reflecting the favorable impact of cost reduction
                                         initiatives. JDL Technologies also contributed $0.5 million to consolidated operating
                                         income in Q3 2016.    

CSI s
Chief Executive Officer Roger H.D. Lacey commented,  In Q3 2016, we continued to grow new product sales at our manufacturing
businesses, implemented corporate and business unit cost reductions and achieved company-wide operational improvements through
our Lean Six Sigma initiative,  OneCSI.  This quarter Transition Networks demonstrated the significant potential of
our cost-reduction efforts, reporting an 80% year-over-year increase in operating income on roughly flat year-over-year revenue
growth. We remain optimistic that the right-sizing initiatives we implemented at Suttle similarly will lead to operating improvement
in 2017.  

Countering
a decline in international sales, Suttle s domestic revenue increased 1.4% year to date. While we can t control the
pace of decline in legacy product sales, we can and are building new product revenue streams, with an emphasis on innovative solutions
that address the global buildout of Gigabit broadband as well as bandwidth, distance and security limitations of networks that
are always in transition. Suttle s new product sales increased 36% year over year to $3.4 million, or approximately 33%
of total Q3 2016 business unit sales. Transition Networks  new product sales grew by 118% to $3.0 million, or approximately
26% of total business unit sales in Q3 2016. We expect several new products currently in various stages of the customer approval
process at Suttle and Transition Networks will favorably impact 2017 results.   

Mr.
Lacey concluded,  JDL Technologies, our IT services business, continued to contribute positive operating income, albeit
at a lower level from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting inherent variability in the education sector s technology
refresh schedules. To offset this type of variability, JDL Technologies is focused on growing recurring revenues from its award-winning
IT managed services platform by expanding into new geographies and verticals, while continuing to penetrate the healthcare sector
with its well-established HIPAA-compliant IT services offering. In conclusion, we believe we are pursuing the best strategy at
each business to return CSI to profitable growth.

Q3
2016 Segment Financial Overview     

Suttle    

Suttle s
sales decreased 31% to $10.4 million in Q3 2016, from $15.1 million in Q3 2015 due to lower sales of its legacy products in international
markets, and a disrupted ordering cycle with a major domestic customer. Sales to the major communication service providers decreased
14% to $9.4 million in Q3 2016 from $11.0 million in Q3 2015. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 3.3% from 20.5%
in the same period of 2015 due to reduced productivity in the manufacturing process related to certain new product introductions
and write off of obsolete inventory.  

Transition
Networks    

Transition
Networks  sales were $11.8 million in Q3 2016, compared to $11.9 million in Q3 2015. Sales in North America remained approximately
flat in Q3 2016 as compared to Q3 2015, while international sales decreased 4%, or by $0.1 million. Transition Networks 
operating income increased 80% to $1.6 million in Q3 2016, from $0.9 million in Q3 2015, primarily reflecting initiatives to reduce
global selling costs and higher gross margin due to improved product mix.

declined 39% to $2.4 million in Q3 2016, from $3.9 million in Q3 2015, due to the cyclical nature of the education sector and
its technology refresh schedule.
