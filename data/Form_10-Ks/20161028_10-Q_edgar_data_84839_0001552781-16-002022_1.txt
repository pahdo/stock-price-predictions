NOTE
                          1.      BASIS
OF PREPARATION AND OTHER  

Basis
of Preparation   - The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and therefore do not include all information and footnotes required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. There has been no
material change in the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K of Rollins, Inc. (the  Company ) for the year ended December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the
quarterly condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures herein should be read in conjunction with the
2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

The
preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in
the condensed consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the Company makes estimates in its interim condensed consolidated
financial statements for the termite accrual which includes future costs including termiticide life expectancy and government
regulations, the insurance accrual which includes self insurance and worker s compensation, inventory adjustments, discounts
and volume incentives earned, among others.  

In
the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial results for the
interim periods have been made. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the three and
nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year.  

The
Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. The Company s results of operations and
its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer, or a few customers, or the Company s foreign operations.  

Three-for-two
stock split   - The Board of Directors at its quarterly meeting on January 27, 2015, authorized a three-for-two stock
split by the issuance on March 10, 2015 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at February
10, 2015.  

All
share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted for the three-for-two stock split effective March 10, 2015
for shareholders of record February 10, 2015.  

NOTE
                          2.      RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

Recently
adopted accounting standards    

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. (ASU) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which
requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.
The amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement
that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not
affected by the amendments in this update. The amendments in this update are effective for the Company s financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December
15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments
in this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods
presented. We have elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 retrospectively in the first quarter of 2016. As a result, we have presented
all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on our consolidated balance sheets, and have reclassified current deferred
tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. There was no net impact on our results of
operations as a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-17.  

Recently
issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2016 or later    

In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  ASU 2014-09
completes the joint effort by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to improve financial reporting by creating
common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). ASU 2014-09 applies to all
companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for public entities
for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. On July 9, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,
which deferred the effective date of this new standard to periods beginning after December 15, 2017 for public entities. Early
application is permitted, but not before interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities
have the choice to apply ASU 2014-09 either retrospectively to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative
effect of applying ASU 2014-09 at the date of initial application and not adjusting comparative information. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and the method of adoption. We do not expect this
standard to have a material impact on the Company s reported results of operations or financial position.

ROLLINS,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   

In
February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance
sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The ASU also will require disclosures
designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information. The amendments in this update are effective for the Company s
financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. We do not expect this standard to
have a material impact on the Company s reported results of operations or financial position.  

In
March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which involve several aspects
of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic
entities. The amendments in this update are effective for the Company s financial statements issued for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods. Earlier adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim
or annual reporting period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected
as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all
of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial
statements. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company s reported results of operations or
financial position.  

In
August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flow Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,
which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain
cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update are
effective for the Company s financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim
periods within annual periods. Earlier adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual reporting period. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. We do not expect this standard to
have a material impact on the Company s reported results of operations or financial position.  

NOTE
                          3.      EARNINGS
PER SHARE  

The
Company follows ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share  (ASC 260) that requires the reporting of both basic and diluted earnings per
share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to participating common stockholders by the weighted
average number of participating common shares outstanding for the period.  

Basic
and diluted earnings per share attributable to common and restricted shares of common stock for the period were as follows:  

NOTE
                          4.      CONTINGENCIES  

In
the normal course of business, certain of the Company s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations
which allege that the subsidiaries  services caused damage.  In addition, the Company defends employment related cases
and claims from time to time. We are involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business.
We are actively contesting each of these matters.   

On
December 2, 2014, Plaintiff Killian Pest Control sued Rollins, Inc. and its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense alleging that HomeTeam s
exclusive use of its  tubes in the walls  system violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act, and California s
Cartwright Act and Business and Professions Code. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates
the Sherman and Cartwright Acts, and the Business and Professions Code; a permanent injunction against continuing alleged violations;
and monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California. Because discovery
remains open and there are unresolved questions of fact and law, the Company cannot currently estimate the loss, if any, and intends
to defend this matter vigorously.

ROLLINS,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   

On
December 2, 2014, Plaintiff Jose Luis Garnica, on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated customers, sued Rollins,
Inc. and its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense alleging that HomeTeam s exclusive use of its  tubes in the walls 
system violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act. The Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates
the Sherman Act; a permanent injunction against continuing violations; and monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending in the United
States District Court, Northern District of California. Because discovery remains open and there are unresolved questions of fact
and law, the Company cannot currently estimate the loss, if any, and intends to defend this matter vigorously.  

Management
does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse
effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable
outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual quarter or year.  

NOTE
                          5.      FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, notes receivable, accounts payable
and other short-term liabilities. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values.  The
Company has a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured line of credit of up to
$175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility and a $25.0 million swingline subfacility. There were
no outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

NOTE
                          6.      STOCKHOLDERS 
EQUITY  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company paid $65.5 million or $0.30 per share in cash dividends compared to $52.4
million or $0.24 per share during the same period in 2015.  

During
the third quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 0.4 million shares from the open market of its $1 par value
common stock at a weighted average price of $27.77 per share. No shares were repurchased during the same period in 2015. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased from the open market approximately 0.8 million shares of its
$1 par value common stock at a weighted average price of $27.19 per share compared to approximately 19,000 shares that were repurchased
at a weighted average price of $22.42 during the same period in 2015.  

The Company also repurchases shares from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares.
For this purpose, the Company repurchased $0.9 million of common stock during the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 and the
Company did not repurchase any of its common stock for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015, and repurchased $8.3 million
and $7.0 million of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

As
more fully discussed in Note 14 of the Company s notes to the consolidated financial statements in its 2015 Annual Report
on Form 10-K, stock options, time lapse restricted shares (TLRS s) and restricted stock units have been issued to officers
and other management employees under the Company s Employee Stock Incentive Plans.  The Company issues new shares from
its authorized but unissued share pool. At September 30, 2016, approximately 4.6 million shares of the Company s common
stock were reserved for issuance.  

Time
Lapse Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units   

The
following table summarizes the components of the Company s stock-based compensation programs recorded as expense:  

The Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of approximately $0.4 million and a deferred tax benefit of
$0.1 million during the third quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively, and a deferred tax benefit of approximately
$3.5 million, $1.8 million and $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the year ended December 31,
2015, respectively, related to the vesting of restricted shares which have been recorded as increases to paid-in capital.

NOTE
                          8.      BUSINESS
COMBINATIONS  

The
Company made twenty eight acquisitions during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, and twelve acquisitions for the
year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, as disclosed on various press releases and related Form 8-Ks.  

Total
cash purchase price for the Company s acquisitions for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $40.8 million net of
cash acquired.  

The
preliminary values of major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded at the date of acquisition, as adjusted
during the valuation period, are included in the reconciliation of the total consideration as follows (in thousands):  

Goodwill
from acquisitions represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. The carrying
amount of goodwill was $260.2 million and $249.9 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Goodwill generally
changes due to the timing of acquisitions, finalization of allocation of purchase prices of previous acquisitions and foreign
currency translations. The carrying amount of goodwill in foreign countries was $47.2 million at September 30, 2016 and $36.9
million at December 31, 2015.  

The
Company completed its most recent annual impairment analyses as of September 30, 2016. Based upon the results of these analyses,
the Company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or other intangible assets was indicated.  

The
carrying amount of customer contracts and other intangible assets was $116.6 million and $45.2 million, respectively, at September
30, 2016, and $92.8 million and $46.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015. The carrying amount of customer contracts and
other intangible assets in foreign countries was $32.1 million and $4.4 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016, and $14.9
million and $4.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015.  

Customer
contracts and other amortizable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic useful lives. The
following table sets forth the components of intangible assets as of September 30, 2016 (in thousands):

                          9.      DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES  

Risk
Management Objective of Using Derivatives   

The
Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. To manage this risk, the
Company enters into derivative financial instruments from time to time. Certain of the Company s foreign operations expose
the Company to fluctuations of foreign interest rates and exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of the Company s
cash receipts and payments in terms of the Company s functional currency. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments
from time to time to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of its functional currency, the U.S.
dollar.  

Hedges
of Foreign Exchange Risk   

The
Company is exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against its functional currency, the US dollar. The Company uses
foreign currency derivatives, specifically vanilla foreign currency forwards, to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the USD-CAD
and AUD-USD exchange rates. Currency forward agreements involve fixing the foreign currency exchange rate for delivery of a specified
amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The currency forward agreements are typically cash settled in US dollars for their
fair value at or close to their settlement date.  

The
Company does not currently designate any of these foreign exchange forwards under hedge accounting, but rather reflects the changes
in fair value immediately in earnings. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company s
exposure to foreign exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded
directly in earnings and were equal to a gain of $0.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and a loss of $0.5 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had the following outstanding derivatives
that were not designated as hedges in qualifying hedging relationships (in thousands except for number of instruments):  

The
table below presents the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on
the Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):

The
table below presents the total fair value classification within the fair value hierarchy for the complete portfolio of derivative
transactions at September 30, 2016 (in thousands):  

As
of September 30, 2016, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position was $0.1 million inclusive of counterparty credit
risk. As of the balance sheet date, the Company has not posted any collateral related to these agreements. If the Company had
breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2016, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements
at their termination value of $0.1 million.  

NOTE
                          10.      SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS  

On October 25, 2016, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend
on its common stock of $0.10 per share plus a special year-end dividend of $0.10 per share both payable December 9, 2016 to shareholders

2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Overview   

On
October 26, 2016, the Company reported its 42 nd  consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings. Net income was
$49.7 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $45.0 million for the prior year quarter, a 10.2%
improvement.  Revenues increased by 6.1% to $424.0 million for the third quarter 2016 as compared to $399.7 million for the
prior year third quarter.  The Company saw a negative impact on the exchange rate of the Canadian and Australian dollars
and British pounds to U.S. dollars reducing revenues and pre-tax earnings by $9.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Earnings
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased to $0.23 per diluted share, as compared to $0.21 per diluted share for the
same period in 2015.  

During
the quarter, the Company announced the retirement of the President of Orkin North America, Gene Iarocci who had completed 12 years
with Rollins after an illustrious 48-year business career. Freeman Elliott was promoted to President of Orkin U.S., Jerry Gahlhoff
has been elevated to oversee operations of Specialty Brands and Steve Leavitt has been given the responsibility of Emerging Markets
which include our international companies as well as other initiatives.

ROLLINS,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   

The
Company also announced the acquisition of Scientific Pest Management, which provides pest control service all over Australia through
owned, franchise and partner companies. Scientific Pest Management was founded in 1974 and operated by Chris Jones. With more
than 50 employees, the company offers commercial pest control and termite services, specializing in large contracts.  

Rollins
continued its solid financial performance generating $158.2 million in cash from operations year to date.  

Results
of Operations:   

THREE
MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

Revenue   

Revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased $24.2 million or 6.1% to $424.0 million
compared to $399.7 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Growth occurred across all service lines.
Substantially all of this increase in revenues was due to growth in customers and pricing while less than 1% of the increase was
attributable to current year acquisitions.  

The
Company has three primary service offerings: commercial, residential and termite including ancillary services. During the third
quarter ended September 30, 2016, commercial pest control revenue approximated 40% of the Company s revenues, residential
pest control approximated 43% of the Company s revenues, and termite and ancillary service revenue approximated 16% of the
Company s revenues. Comparing third quarter 2016 to third quarter 2015, the Company s commercial pest control revenue
grew 4.9%, residential pest control revenue grew 7.0%, and termite and ancillary services revenue grew 7.2%.  Foreign operations
accounted for approximately 8% and 7% of total revenues during the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Revenues
are impacted by the seasonal nature of the Company s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest activity, as
well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the change in seasons),
has historically resulted in an increase in the Company s revenues as evidenced by the following chart:  

Cost
of Services Provided   

Cost of Services provided for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased $10.1 million or 5.2%,
compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Gross margin for the quarter increased to 51.5% for the third quarter versus
51.1% prior year third quarter. The margin for the quarter benefited from improved efficiencies in routing and scheduling technology
which also helped to lower salaries as a percent of revenue. This also caused reductions in fleet expenses with gasoline expense
down 11.9%. Personnel related expenses were down as a percent of revenue as group insurance expense was down quarter-over-quarter.
We recorded lower insurance expense as auto liability expenses were lower quarter-over-quarter. We saw an expected increase in
maintenance expense and software costs related to BOSS, our new CRM and operating system. The Company experienced good cost controls
across most spending categories. 

Depreciation
and Amortization   

Depreciation
and Amortization expenses for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased $1.9 million to $13.1 million, an increase
of 17.3%. Depreciation increased due to expenditures associated with the rollout of BOSS as well as acquisitions and equipment
purchases while amortization of intangible assets increased due to amortization of customer contracts included in acquisitions.  

Sales,
General and Administrative   

Sales, General and Administrative Expenses for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased $3.5 million
or 2.8%, to 29.6% of revenues, down 0.9 percentage points from 30.5% for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The
decrease in the percent of revenue is due to lower administrative salaries as percent of revenues as we maintain a quality support
center staff while continuing to grow revenues. The Company experienced reduced personnel related expenses from lower group insurance
expense, reduced telephone costs due to a change of data service providers. As planned, the Company experienced increased sales
salaries and advertising expenses directed toward increased revenue production.

ROLLINS,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   

Gain
on Sale of assets, Net   

Gain
on sales of assets, net was a net gain of $0.1 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016, down from $1.3 million
prior year. The Company sold a building in 2015.  

Income
Taxes   

Income
Taxes for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased $2.9 million or 10.7% to $30.3 million from $27.4 million reported
for third quarter ended September 30, 2015. This was due to increased pretax earnings. The effective tax rate was 37.9% for the
third quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 37.8% for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to differences in
investment credits, deferred taxes and state tax rates.  

NINE
MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

Revenue   

Revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $65.1 million or 5.8% to $1.188 billion compared to $1.123 billion for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    The Company saw an increase in leads and closure on sales to new customers
while average price remained relatively flat in most categories. Acquisitions contributed less than 1% of revenues for the first
nine months. The higher sales to new customers resulted in growth across all service lines.  

Commercial
pest control revenue approximated 40% of the Company s revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, residential
pest control revenue approximated 42% of revenues, and termite and ancillary service revenues, made up approximately 17% of the
Company s revenues. The Company s commercial pest control revenue grew 4.0%, residential pest control revenue grew
7.1%, and termite and ancillary services revenue grew 6.5%. Foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% of total revenues
for each of the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Cost
of Services Provided   

Cost
of Services provided for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $25.6 million or 4.6% to $579.4 million compared to
$553.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The year-to-date margin benefited from lower personnel related expense
margins, the Company recording lower insurance and claims expense as auto liability expense was down from 2015. Although salary
expenses increased, they were down as a percentage of revenue. Fleet expenses continued to decline as a percent of revenue as
gasoline expense was down 12.5%. The Company maintained good cost controls across most spending categories.  

Depreciation
and Amortization   

Depreciation
and Amortization expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $3.9 million to $37.1 million, an increase of
11.7%, increasing 0.1 percentage point as a percent of revenue to 3.1% of revenue compared to 3.0% of revenue the prior year.
The dollar increase was due to expenditures associated with the rollout of our CRM system, BOSS, while amortization of intangible
assets increased due to amortized customer contracts included in acquisitions.  

Sales,
General and Administrative   

Sales, General and Administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $18.1 million
or 5.2% to $364.2 million while decreasing to 30.7% of revenues, from $346.1 million or 30.8% of revenues in the prior year period.
The decrease in percentage of revenue was primarily due to the Company s lower administrative and sales salaries, advertising,
bad debt expense, and maintenance agreements as a percent of revenue. We continue to be cost conscious and maintain control of
expenses.  

Gain
on Sale of assets, Net   

Gain
on sales of assets, net was a net gain of $0.7 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 a decrease of $0.8 million
from $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In 2016 the Company sold its wildlife service franchise supplier
and a branch location while in 2015 we sold a building. The Company also recognized net gains from the sale of Company owned vehicles
and property in 2016 and 2015.  

Income
Taxes   

Income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $78.7 million, a 10.9% increase from
$71.0 million reported for the same period in 2015, and reflect increased pre-tax income over the prior year period. The effective
tax rate was 37.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus 37.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily
due to certain discrete items within each period.

ROLLINS,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
Company believes its current cash and cash equivalents balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities
and available borrowings under its $175.0 million credit facility will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations,
and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future. The Company s operating activities generated net cash of
$158.2 million and $143.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company made contributions of $3.0 million to its defined benefit retirement plans (the  Plans )
compared to $5.0 million in contributions during the same period in 2015. The Company is considering making further contributions
of $0.3 million to the Plans during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. In the opinion of management, Plan contributions
will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity for 2016.  

The Company invested approximately $27.1 million in capital expenditures, exclusive of expenditures for business
acquisitions, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $28.6 million during the same period in 2015, and expects
to invest approximately $6.0 million for the remainder of 2016. Capital expenditures for the first nine months consisted primarily
of the purchase of operating equipment replacements and technology related projects. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company made expenditures for acquisitions totaling $40.8 million, compared to $31.4 million during the same period in
2015. A total of $65.5 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.30 per share) during the first nine months of 2016, compared to $52.4
million or ($0.24 per share) during the same period in 2015. On October 25, 2016, the Company announced that the Board of Directors
declared a regular quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of $0.10 per share plus a special year-end dividend of $0.10 per
share both payable December 9, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business November 10, 2016 to be funded with existing
cash balances. The Company expects to continue to pay cash dividends to common stockholders, subject to the earnings and financial
condition of the Company and other relevant factors. The Company repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares at a weighted average
price of $27.19 from the open market during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the repurchase of approximately 19,000 shares
at a weighted average price of $22.42 during the first nine months of 2015. The Company has had a buyback program in place for
a number of years and has routinely purchased shares when it felt the opportunity was desirable. The Board authorized the purchase
of 7.5 million additional shares of the Company s common stock in July 2012. These authorizations enable the Company to continue
the purchase of Company common stock when appropriate, which is an important benefit resulting from the Company s strong
cash flows. The stock buy-back program has no expiration date. In total, 5.1 million additional shares may be purchased under the
share repurchase program. The Company repurchased $8.3 million and $7.0 million of common stock for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares. The acquisitions, capital
expenditures, share repurchases and cash dividends were funded through existing cash balances and operating activities.  

The
Company s balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 includes short-term unearned revenues of $110.8 million
and $96.2 million, respectively, representing approximately 7% of our annual revenue. This represents cash paid to the Company
by its customers in advance of services that will be recognized over the next twelve months. The Company s $139.3 million
of total cash at September 30, 2016, is held at various banking institutions. Approximately $41.3 million is held in cash accounts
at foreign bank institutions and the remaining $98.0 million is primarily held in non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic
banks. The Company s international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets
in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation
of cash from the Company s foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the Company s current business plan. The Company
maintains a large cash position in the United States while having little third-party debt to service. The Company maintains adequate
liquidity and capital resources that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its
domestic business for the foreseeable future without regard to its foreign deposits.  

On
October 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured
line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline
subfacility.   The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility
as of September 30, 2016.    The Company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants through the date of this
filing and expects to maintain compliance through 2016.  

Litigation   

In
the normal course of business, certain of the Company s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations
which allege that the subsidiaries  services caused damage.  In addition, the Company defends employment related cases
and claims from time to time. We are involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business.
We are actively contesting each of these matters.  

On
December 2, 2014, Plaintiff Killian Pest Control sued Rollins, Inc. and its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense alleging that HomeTeam s
exclusive use of its  tubes in the walls  system violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act, and California s
Cartwright Act and Business and Professions Code. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates
the Sherman and Cartwright Acts, and the Business and Professions Code; a permanent injunction against continuing alleged violations;
and monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California. Because discovery
remains open and there are unresolved questions of fact and law, the Company cannot currently estimate the loss, if any, and intends
to defend this matter vigorously.

On
December 2, 2014, Plaintiff Jose Luis Garnica, on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated customers, sued Rollins,
Inc. and its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense alleging that HomeTeam s exclusive use of its  tubes in the walls 
system violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act. The Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates
the Sherman Act; a permanent injunction against continuing violations; and monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending in the United
States District Court, Northern District of California. Because discovery remains open and there are unresolved questions of fact
and law, the Company cannot currently estimate the loss, if any, and intends to defend this matter vigorously.  

Management
does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse
effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable
outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual quarter or year.  

Critical
Accounting Policies  

There
have been no changes to the Company s critical accounting policies since the filing of its Form 10-K for the year ended

Accounting Standards    

See
Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including
the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition.  

Forward-Looking
Statements   

This
Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the effect of the future adoption of recent accounting pronouncements
on the Company s financial statements; statements regarding management s expectation regarding the effect of the ultimate
resolution of pending claims, proceedings or litigation on the Company s financial position, results of operation and liquidity;
the Company s belief that its current cash and cash equivalent balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from
operating activities and available borrowings will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion
of the business for the foreseeable future; our expectation that the Company will continue to pay dividends; our intention to
continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as
well as acquisitions of unrelated companies and that repatriation of cash is not a part of the Company s business plan;
possible defined benefit retirement plan contributions and their effect on the Company s financial position, results of
operations and liquidity; the Company s expectation regarding capital expenditure for the remainder of 2016; the Company s
expectation to maintain compliance with debt covenants; and the Company s belief that interest rate exposure and foreign
exchange rate risk will not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations going forward. The actual results
of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties
including, without limitation, the possibility of an adverse ruling against the Company in pending litigation; general economic
conditions; market risk; changes in industry practices or technologies; the degree of success of the Company s termite process
and pest control selling and treatment methods; the Company s ability to identify and integrate potential acquisitions;
climate and weather conditions; competitive factors and pricing practices; our ability to attract and retain skilled workers,
and potential increases in labor costs; and changes in various government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations.
All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases the Company cannot
predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking
statements. A more detailed discussion of potential risks facing the Company can be found in the Company s Report on Form
10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company does not undertake to
update its forward looking statements.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company maintained an investment portfolio (included in cash and cash equivalents) subject to short-term
interest rate risk exposure. The Company is subject to interest rate risk exposure through borrowings on its $175 million credit
facility. The Company is also exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. See note 9 to Part I, Item
1 for a discussion of the Company s investments in derivative financial instruments to manage risks of fluctuations in foreign
exchange rates. The Company believes that this foreign exchange rate risk will not have a material impact upon the Company s
results of operations going forward. There have been no material changes to the Company s market risk exposure since the
end of fiscal year 2015.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of September 30, 2016 (the  Evaluation
Date ). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the Evaluation Date to ensure that the information
required to be included in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.  

In
addition, management s quarterly evaluation identified no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the second quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. As of September 30, 2016 we did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal controls, and therefore no corrective
actions were taken.
