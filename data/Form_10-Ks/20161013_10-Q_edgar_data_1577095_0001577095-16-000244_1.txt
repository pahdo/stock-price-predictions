1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS 
    
  ClubCorp Holdings, Inc. ( Holdings ) and its wholly owned subsidiaries CCA Club Operations Holdings, LLC ( Operations  Parent ) and ClubCorp Club Operations, Inc. ( Operations  and, together with Holdings and Operations  Parent,  ClubCorp ) were formed on   November 10, 2010  , as part of a reorganization of ClubCorp, Inc. ( CCI ), which was effective as of   November 30, 2010  , for the purpose of operating and managing golf and country clubs and business, sports and alumni clubs. ClubCorp, together with its subsidiaries, may be referred to as  we ,  us ,  our  or the  Company .  
    
  As of   September 6, 2016  , we own, lease or operate through joint ventures   151   golf and country clubs and manage   nine   golf and country clubs. Likewise, we own, lease or operate through a joint venture   45   business, sports and alumni clubs and manage   three   business, sports and alumni clubs. Our facilities are located in   26   states, the District of Columbia and   two   foreign countries. 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Basis of Presentation   The consolidated condensed financial statements reflect the consolidated operations of ClubCorp, its wholly and majority owned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities ( VIEs ) for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The consolidated condensed financial statements presented herein reflect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and changes in equity in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or  GAAP . All intercompany accounts have been eliminated. Immaterial amounts relating to Loss from discontinued operations have been reclassified to Interest and investment income for the prior year. 
    
  Investments in certain unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for by the equity method. See Note    4   . 
  We have entered into agreements with third-party owners of clubs to act as a managing agent and provide certain services to the third party club owner in exchange for a management fee. The operations of managed clubs are not consolidated. We recognize the contractual management fees as revenue when earned. Additionally, we recognize reimbursements for certain costs of operations at certain managed clubs as revenue. 
  The accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements are unaudited. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP have been omitted from the accompanying financial statements. We believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. However, the financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated condensed financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 29, 2015  . 
    
  We believe that the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring items, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of fiscal year performance because of the impact of seasonal and short-term variations and other factors such as timing of acquisitions and dispositions of facilities. 
    
  We have two reportable segments: (1) golf and country clubs and (2) business, sports and alumni clubs. These segments are managed separately and discrete financial information, including Adjusted EBITDA ( Adjusted EBITDA ), a key financial measurement of segment profit and loss, is reviewed regularly by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources. See Note    12   . 
    
  Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated condensed financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from such estimated amounts. 
    
  Revenue Recognition   Revenues from club operations, food and beverage and merchandise sales are recognized at the time of sale or when the service is provided and are reported net of sales taxes. Revenues from membership dues are generally billed monthly and recognized in the period earned.  

8 

At a majority of our private clubs, members are expected to pay an initiation fee or deposit upon their acceptance as a member to the club. In general, initiation fees are not refundable, whereas initiation deposits are not refundable until a fixed number of years (generally   30  ) after the date of acceptance of a member. We recognize revenue related to membership initiation fees and deposits over the expected life of an active membership.  
    
  For membership initiation deposits, the difference between the amount paid by the member and the present value of the refund obligation is deferred and recognized within club operations revenue over the expected life of an active membership. The present value of the refund obligation is recorded as a   membership initiation deposit liability   and accretes over the non-refundable term using the effective interest method with an interest rate defined as our incremental borrowing rate adjusted to reflect a   30  -year time frame. The accretion is included in   interest expense  . 
    
  The majority of membership initiation fees received are not refundable and are deferred and recognized within club operations revenue on the consolidated condensed statements of operations over the expected life of an active membership. 
    
  The expected lives of active memberships are calculated annually using historical attrition rates. Periods in which attrition rates differ significantly from enrollment rates could have a material effect on our consolidated condensed financial statements by decreasing or increasing the expected lives of active memberships, which in turn would affect the length of time over which we recognize initiation fee and deposit revenues. During the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , our estimated expected lives ranged from   one   to   20 years  ; the weighted-average expected life of a golf and country club membership was approximately   seven   years and the expected life of a business, sports and alumni club membership was approximately   three   years.  
    
  Membership initiation payments recognized within   club operations revenue   on the consolidated condensed statements of operations were   $3.3 million   and   $3.3 million   for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively, and   $9.8 million   and   $9.5 million   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-9 ( ASU 2014-9 ),   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . ASU 2014-9 requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer, as well as enhanced disclosure requirements. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-9 to fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-8 ( ASU 2016-8 ) which clarified the revenue recognition implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and is effective during the same period as ASU 2014-9. In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10 ( ASU 2016-10 ) which clarified the revenue recognition guidance regarding the identification of performance obligations and the licensing implementation and is effective during the same period as ASU 2014-9. In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12 ( ASU 2016-12 ) which narrowly amended the revenue recognition guidance regarding collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition.  ASU 2016-12 is effective during the same period as ASU 2014-9. We are still evaluating the impact that our adoption of ASU 2014-9, ASU 2016-8, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 ( ASU 2014-15 ),   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  . ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on management s responsibility to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosure requirements. We adopted ASU 2014-15 during the twelve weeks ended March 22, 2016. Our adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated condensed financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-2 ( ASU 2015-2 ),   Consolidation (Topic 810) Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . ASU 2015-2 applies to entities in all industries and provides a new scope exception to registered money market funds and similar unregistered money market funds. It makes targeted amendments 
  to existing consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the VIE guidance. The targeted changes are designed to address most of the concerns of the asset management industry. However, entities across all industries will be impacted, particularly those that use limited partnerships. We adopted ASU 2015-2 during the twelve weeks  
  
   9 

ended March 22, 2016. Our adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-3 ( ASU 2015-3 ),   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   ASU 2015-3 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. We adopted ASU 2015-3 during the twelve weeks ended March 22, 2016 and applied it retrospectively. As a result, we have recast the December 29, 2015 consolidated condensed balance sheet to conform to the current period presentation. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15 ( ASU 2015-15 ),   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,   confirming that fees related to revolving credit facility arrangements are not addressed in ASU 2015-03. The adoption of this standard reduced previously-presented Other Assets and Long-term Debt by   $13.0 million   each. Debt issuance costs associated with our revolving credit facility are recorded within Other Assets for all periods presented. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16 ( ASU 2015-16 ),   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  . ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. We adopted ASU 2015-16 during the twelve weeks ended March 22, 2016. Our adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17 ( ASU 2015-17 ),   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  . ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. We adopted ASU 2015-17 during the twelve weeks ended March 22, 2016 and applied it retrospectively. As a result, we have recast the December 29, 2015 consolidated condensed balance sheet to conform to the current period presentation. The adoption of this standard decreased previously-presented Deferred tax assets, net and decreased Deferred tax liabilities, net by   $22.6 million   each. Additionally, Deferred tax assets, net are now classified as non-current. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-2 ( ASU 2016-2 ),   Leases (Topic 842).   ASU 2016-2 requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP; however, ASU 2016-2 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous leases guidance. The result of retaining a distinction between finance leases and operating leases is that the effect of leases in the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of cash flows is largely unchanged from previous GAAP. ASU 2016-2 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. We are still evaluating the impact that our adoption of ASU 2016-2 will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-9 ( ASU 2016-9 ),   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   ASU 2016-9 simplifies the accounting for several aspects of the accounting for equity-based compensation, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. We adopted ASU 2016-9 in the twelve weeks ended March 22, 2016. In accordance with the ASU, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and we have made a policy election to account for forfeitures in the period they occur, rather than estimating a forfeiture rate. Applying this guidance on a modified retrospective basis resulted in a decrease to Accumulated deficit of   $3.1 million  , a decrease to Additional paid-in-capital of   $0.8 million   and a decrease to Deferred tax liabilities of   $2.3 million  . 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 ( ASU 2016-13 ),   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . ASU 2016-13 requires that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected credit losses during the period. The measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. ASU 2016-13 will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.

3. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
    
  Consolidated VIEs include   three   managed golf course properties and certain realty interests which we define as  Non-Core Development Entities . We have determined we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs as we have the obligation to absorb the majority of losses from and direct activities of these operations. One of these managed golf course property VIEs is financed through a loan payable of   $0.7 million   collateralized by assets of the entity totaling   $3.9 million   as of   September 6, 2016  . The other managed golf course property VIEs are financed through advances from us. Outstanding advances as of   September 6, 2016   total   $4.7 million   compared to recorded assets of   $7.1 million  . The VIE related to the Non-Core Development Entities is financed through notes which are payable through cash proceeds related to the sale of certain real estate held by the Non-Core Development Entities. Recourse of creditors to these VIEs is limited to the assets of the VIE entities, which total   $11.8 million   and   $11.3 million   at   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The following summarizes the carrying amount and classification of the VIEs  assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  , net of intercompany amounts: 

4. INVESTMENTS 
    
  We have an equity method investment in one active golf and country club joint venture with a carrying value of   $0.4 million   and   $0.5 million   at   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  , respectively. Our share of earnings in the equity investment is included in   equity in (earnings) loss from unconsolidated ventures   in the consolidated condensed statements of operations. 
    
  We also have an equity method investment of   10.2%   in Avendra, LLC, a purchasing cooperative of hospitality companies. The carrying value of the investment was   $1.4 million   and   $2.0 million   at   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  , respectively. Our share of earnings in the equity investment is included in   equity in (earnings) loss from unconsolidated ventures   in the consolidated condensed statements of operations. Additionally, we recognized   $2.0 million   and   $3.5 million   of return on our equity investment in Avendra within   interest and investment income   during the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , respectively.   No   return on our equity investment in Avendra was recorded during the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  . All cash distributions from our equity investment are reported as distribution from investment in unconsolidated ventures within the operating section of our consolidated condensed statements of cash flows.  
    
  We also have contractual agreements with the Avendra joint venture to provide procurement services for our clubs for which we received net volume rebates and allowances totaling   $0.0 million   and   $2.9 million   during the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , respectively, and   $0.0 million   and   $2.5 million   during the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , respectively.

5. FAIR VALUE 
    
  GAAP establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. The three levels of inputs are defined as follows: 
    
  Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets accessible by the Company; 
    
  Level 2 inputs that are observable in the marketplace other than those inputs classified as Level 1; and 
    
  Level 3 inputs that are unobservable in the marketplace and significant to the valuation. 
    
  We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument is categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation. We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy on the date of the change in circumstances that caused the transfer.  
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  Debt   We estimate the fair value of our debt obligations, excluding capital lease obligations and loan origination fees, as follows, as of   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  : 

______________________ 
    
           (1) 
    The recorded value for Level 2 debt obligations is presented net of the   $5.0 million   and   $5.5 million   discount as of   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  , respectively, on the Secured Credit Facilities, as defined in Note    9   . 
       
  The 2015 Senior Notes and borrowings under the Secured Credit Facilities, as both are defined in Note    9   , are considered Level 2. We use quoted prices for identical or similar liabilities to value debt obligations classified as Level 2. All other debt obligations are considered Level 3. We use adjusted quoted prices for similar liabilities to value debt obligations classified as Level 3. Key inputs include: (1) the determination that certain other debt obligations are similar, (2) nonperformance risk, and (3) interest rates. Changes or fluctuations in these assumptions and valuations will result in different estimates of value. The use of different techniques to determine the fair value of these debt obligations could result in different estimates of fair value at the reporting date. 
    
  The carrying value of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, receivables, notes receivable, accounts payable and other short-term and long-term assets and liabilities approximate their fair values as of   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  . 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis 
    
    Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include equity method investments, property and equipment, mineral rights, goodwill, trade names, liquor licenses, management contracts and other assets and liabilities recorded during business combinations. Assets and liabilities from business combinations were recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets at fair value at the date of acquisition. The key assumptions used in determining these values are considered Level 3 measurements. 

12 

Property and Equipment   We recognized impairment losses to property and equipment of   $0.9 million   during the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   $0.8 million   and   $1.8 million   during the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , respectively, to adjust the carrying amount of certain property and equipment to its fair value of   zero  , due to continued and projected lower operating results as well as changes in the expected holding period of certain fixed assets. The valuation methods used to determine fair value included an evaluation of the sales price of comparable real estate properties, a sales comparison approach, an analysis of discounted future cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate, an income approach, and consideration of historical cost adjusted for economic obsolescence, a cost approach. The fair value calculations associated with these valuations are classified as Level 3 measurements. 
    
  Investments and Other Assets   We evaluate our investments and other assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through future cash flows. We recognized impairment losses to investments and other assets of   $0.7 million   and   $1.2 million   during the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , respectively, to adjust the carrying amount of certain assets to their fair value of   zero  . There were   no   impairments recorded to these assets during the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  .  

6. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 
    
  Property and equipment, including capital lease assets, at cost consists of the following at   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  : 

We evaluate property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through future cash flows. See Note    5   . 
    
  We received insurance proceeds of   $4.4 million   related to rain and flooding events that occurred during the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , damaging certain property and equipment. These proceeds were recognized within   Loss on disposals of assets  . 

13 

7. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
    
  Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following at   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  : 

Intangible Assets   Intangible asset amortization expense was   $0.3 million   and   $0.7 million   for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively, and   $1.4 million   and   $2.0 million   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively. We recognized impairment losses to intangible assets of   $0.2 million   and   $0.3 million   during the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively. We retired fully amortized trade name intangible assets and the related amortization of   $0.0 million   and   $1.1 million   during the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  .  
    
  For each of the five years subsequent to   2015   and thereafter the amortization expense is expected to be as follows: 

Goodwill   The following table shows goodwill activity by reporting unit. No impairments have been recorded for either reporting unit.

9. DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASES 
    
  Secured Credit Facilities 
    
    Secured Credit Facilities   In 2010, Operations entered into the credit agreement governing the secured credit facilities (the  Secured Credit Facilities ). The credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities was subsequently amended in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. On   January 25, 2016  , Operations entered into a ninth amendment to the credit agreement to replace the existing revolving credit facility with a new revolving credit facility, with a capacity of   $175.0 million  , maturing on   January 25, 2021  . As of   September 6, 2016  , the Secured Credit Facilities are comprised of (i) a   $675.0 million   term loan facility, and (ii) a revolving credit facility with capacity of   $175.0 million   and   $145.0 million   available for borrowing, after deducting   $30.0 million   of standby letters of credit outstanding. In addition, the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities includes capacity which provides, subject to lender participation, for additional borrowings in revolving or term loan commitments of   $125.0 million  , and additional borrowings thereafter so long as a senior secured leverage ratio (the  Senior Secured Leverage Ratio ) does not exceed   3.50  :1.00.   
       
  As of   September 6, 2016  , the interest rate on the term loan facility is a variable rate calculated as the higher of (i)   4.25%   or (ii) an elected LIBOR plus a margin of   3.25%   and the maturity date of the term loan facility is   December 15, 2022  . Refer also to Note    17   . 
    
  As of   September 6, 2016  , the revolving credit commitments mature on   January 25, 2021   and borrowings thereunder bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of   3.0%   per annum. We are required to pay a commitment fee on all undrawn amounts under the revolving credit facility and a fee on all outstanding letters of credit, payable quarterly in arrears.  
    
   As long as commitments are outstanding under the revolving credit facility, we are subject to limitations on the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio and a total leverage ratio (the  Total Leverage Ratio ). The Senior Secured Leverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of Operations  Consolidated Senior Secured Debt (exclusive of the Senior Notes) to Consolidated EBITDA (disclosed as Adjusted EBITDA and defined in Note    12   ) and is calculated on a pro forma basis, giving effect to current period acquisitions as though they had been consummated on the first day of the period presented. The Total Leverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of Operations  Consolidated Total Debt (including the Senior Notes) to Consolidated EBITDA and is also calculated on a pro forma basis. The credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities requires us to maintain a Senior Secured Leverage Ratio no greater than   4.50  :1.00 and a Total Leverage Ratio of no greater than   5.75  :1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. As of   September 6, 2016  , Operations  Senior Secured Leverage Ratio was   2.93  :1.00 and the Total Leverage ratio was   4.36  :1.00. 
    
  All obligations under the Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by Operations  Parent and each existing and all subsequently acquired or organized direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries of Operations, other than certain excluded subsidiaries (collectively, the  Guarantors ). The Secured Credit Facilities are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by a first-priority perfected security interest in substantially all the assets of Operations, and the Guarantors, including, but not limited to (1) a perfected pledge of all the domestic capital stock owned by Operations and the Guarantors, and (2) perfected security interests in and mortgages on substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material fee-owned property of Operations and the Guarantors, subject to certain exclusions. 
       
  2015 Senior Notes 
    
  On   December 15, 2015  , Operations issued   $350.0 million   of senior notes (the  2015 Senior Notes ), maturing   December 15, 2023  . The net proceeds from the offering of the 2015 Senior Notes were used in part to repay amounts outstanding under the Secured Credit Facilities in connection with the eighth amendment to the credit agreement on December 15, 2015. Interest on the 2015 Senior Notes accrues at a fixed rate of   8.25%   per annum. The 2015 Senior Notes are also guaranteed by the Guarantors (other than Operations  Parent) on a full and unconditional basis.  
       
  Notes payable related to certain Non-Core Development Entities 
    
  In 1994 and 1995, we issued notes payable to finance a VIE related to our Non-Core Development Entities. The notes and accrued interest are payable through the cash proceeds related to the sale of certain real estate held by these Non-Core Development Entities. 
  
   16 

Mortgage Loans 
    
  On   August 9, 2016  , we entered into a new secured mortgage loan which was guaranteed by ClubCorp USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Operations, (the  Wells Fargo Mortgage Loan ) with a maturity date of   May 31, 2019  . The note has a principal amount of   $37.0 million   and accrues interest at a variable rate calculated as   2.90%   plus the greater of (i) one month LIBOR or (ii)   0.25%  . The proceeds of the Wells Fargo Mortgage Loan were primarily used to repay outstanding balances on the Stonebriar / Monarch Loan and the existing mortgage loan agreements with Atlantic Capital Bank and BancFirst. There is an option to extend the maturity through   August 9, 2020   and a second option to extend the maturity through   August 9, 2021   upon satisfaction of certain conditions in the loan agreement. 
    
  Stonebriar / Monarch Loan   In   July 2008  , we entered into a secured mortgage loan with General Electric Capital Corporation for   $32.0 million   (the  Stonebriar / Monarch Loan ). Effective November 30, 2015, the maturity date was   November 2016  . On   August 9, 2016  , we repaid this loan using the proceeds from the Wells Fargo Mortgage Loan. 
    
  Atlantic Capital Bank   In   October 2010  , we entered into a new mortgage loan with Atlantic Capital Bank for   $4.0 million   of debt maturing in   2015   with   25   year amortization. Effective   May 6, 2015  , we amended the loan agreement with Atlantic Capital Bank to extend the maturity date to   April 2020  . On   August 9, 2016  , we repaid this loan using the proceeds from the Wells Fargo Mortgage Loan. 
    
  BancFirst   In   May 2013  , in connection with the acquisition of Oak Tree Country Club, we assumed a mortgage loan with BancFirst for   $5.0 million   with an original maturity of   October 2014   and   two   twelve-month options to extend the maturity through   October 2016   upon satisfaction of certain conditions in the loan agreement. Effective   October 1, 2015  , we extended the term of the loan to   October 1, 2016  . On   August 9, 2016  , we repaid this loan using the proceeds from the Wells Fargo Mortgage Loan. 

17 

Long-term borrowings and lease commitments as of   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  , are summarized below:  

______________________ 

(2) 
    As of   September 6, 2016  , the revolving credit facility had capacity of   $175.0 million  , which was reduced by the   $30.0 million   of standby letters of credit outstanding, leaving   $145.0 million   available for borrowing.  
       
           (3) 
    Notes payable and accrued interest related to certain Non-Core Development Entities are payable through the cash proceeds related to the sale of certain real estate held by these Non-Core Development Entities. 

18 

The amount of long-term debt maturing in each of the five years subsequent to   2015   and thereafter is as follows. This table reflects the contractual maturity dates as of   September 6, 2016  . 

10. INCOME TAXES 
    
  Holdings files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, numerous state jurisdictions and in   three   foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes recorded are adjusted to the extent losses or other deductions cannot be utilized in the consolidated federal income tax return. We file state tax returns on a separate company basis or unitary basis as required by law. Additionally, certain subsidiaries of Holdings, owned through lower tier joint ventures, file separate tax returns for federal and state purposes. 
    
  Our annual effective income tax rate is determined by the level and composition of pre-tax income and the mix of income subject to varying foreign, state and local taxes. Our tax expense or benefit recognized in our interim financial statements is determined by multiplying the year-to-date income or loss by the annual effective tax rate, which is an estimate of the expected relationship between tax expense or benefit for the full year to the pre-tax income or loss for the full year (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items). Our effective income tax rate for the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   was   57.3%   and   (9.9)%  , respectively, compared to   63.0%   and   5.4%   for the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , respectively. For the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , the effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal rate of   35.0%   primarily due to state taxes and certain other permanent differences. The relative impact these items have on the effective tax rate varies based on the forecasted amount of pre-tax income or loss for the year. 
    
  We are currently under audit by state income tax authorities. We have received multiple assessments related to such audits and have an immaterial amount recorded within our state income tax payable as of   September 6, 2016  . 
    
  As of   September 6, 2016  , tax years 2010 - 2015 remain open under statute for U.S. federal and most state tax jurisdictions. In Mexico, the statute of limitations is generally   five   years from the date of the filing of the tax return for any particular year, including amended returns. Accordingly, in general, tax years 2009 through 2015 remain open under statute; although certain prior years are also open as a result of the tax proceedings described below. 
    
  Certain of our Mexican subsidiaries are under audit by the Mexican taxing authorities for the   2008   and   2009   tax years. In 2013, we received two assessments, for approximately   $3.0 million   each, exclusive of penalties and interest, for two of our Mexican subsidiaries under audit for the   2008   tax year. We have taken the appropriate procedural steps to contest these assessments through the appropriate Mexican judicial channels. We have not recorded a liability related to these uncertain tax positions as we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail based on the merits of our positions. In 2014, we received an audit assessment for the   2009   tax year for another Mexican subsidiary. We have taken the appropriate procedural steps to contest the assessment through the appropriate Mexican judicial channels. We have recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit for   $4.4 million  , exclusive of penalties and interest, related to this audit. The unrecognized tax benefit has been recorded due to the technical nature of the tax filing position taken by our Mexican subsidiary and uncertainty around the ultimate outcome of this assessment, which we intend to continue to contest. 
    
  As of   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  , we have recorded a total of   $7.7 million   and   $7.3 million  , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties of   $2.9 million   and   $2.3 million  , respectively, which are included in other liabilities in the consolidated condensed balance sheets. If we were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions recorded as of   September 6, 2016  , the net effect would be an income tax benefit of approximately   $4.8 million  , exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. 

19 

Management believes it is unlikely that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next 12 months given the current status in particular of the matters currently under examination by the Mexican tax authorities. However, as audit outcomes and the timing of related resolutions are subject to significant uncertainties, we will continue to evaluate the tax issues related to these assessments in future periods. In summary, we believe we are adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions as of   September 6, 2016  . 

11. NEW AND ACQUIRED CLUBS AND CLUB DIVESTITURES

Club Dispositions and Management Agreement Terminations 
    
  Clubs may be divested when we determine they will be unable to provide a positive contribution to cash flows from operations in future periods and/or when they are determined to be non-strategic holdings. Gains from divestitures are recognized in the period in which operations cease and losses are recognized when we determine that the carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.  
    
  During the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  ,   two   management agreements were terminated, including a management agreement with Jefferson Lakeside Country Club, a private country club located in Richmond, Virginia and a management agreement with Mill Creek Country Club, a private country club located in Mill Creek, Washington. Additionally, we closed Greenspoint Club, a business and sports club we owned which was located in Houston, Texas. No material gain or loss on divestiture was recorded. These divestitures did not qualify as discontinued operations. 
    
  During the fiscal year ended   December 29, 2015  ,   ten   management agreements were terminated, including a management agreement with Shoreby Club, a business and sports club located in Bratenahl, Ohio, a multi-course management agreement for Klein Creek Golf Club, a public golf course located in Winfield, Illinois, The Grove Country Club, a private country club located in Long Grove, Illinois, The Royal Fox Country Club and The Royal Hawk Country Club, private country clubs both located in St. Charles, Illinois, a management agreement with Smoke Rise Country Club, a private country club located in Stone Mountain, Georgia, a management agreement with Stone Creek Golf Club, a semi-private country club located in Ocala, Florida, a management agreement with Regatta Bay Golf and Country Club, a private country club located in Destin, Florida, a management agreement with University of Massachusetts Club, an alumni club located in Boston, Massachusetts and a management agreement with Rancho Vista Golf Club, a public golf club in Rancho Vista, California.

We recognized a gain of   $0.6 million   on the sale which is included in loss on disposals of assets in the consolidated condensed statements of operations. 

12. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
    
  We currently have   two   reportable segments: (1) golf and country clubs and (2) business, sports and alumni clubs. These segments are managed separately and discrete financial information, including Adjusted EBITDA, our financial measure of segment profit and loss, is reviewed regularly by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. We also use Adjusted EBITDA, on a consolidated basis, to assess our ability to service our debt, incur additional debt and meet our capital expenditure requirements. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as it provides additional information to investors about our performance and investors and lenders have historically used EBITDA-related measures. 
    
  EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, income taxes, interest and investment income, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus or minus impairments, gain or loss on disposition and acquisition of assets, losses from discontinued operations, loss on extinguishment of debt, non-cash and other adjustments, equity-based compensation expense and a deferred revenue adjustment. The deferred revenue adjustment to revenues and Adjusted EBITDA within each segment represents estimated deferred revenue using current membership life estimates related to initiation payments that would have been recognized in the applicable period but for the application of purchase accounting. Adjusted EBITDA is based on the definition of Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the 2015 Senior Notes contain certain covenants which are based upon specified financial ratios in reference to Adjusted EBITDA, after giving effect to the pro forma impact of  
  
   22 

acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA as reported is identical to the computation of Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the credit agreement governing our Secured Credit Facilities, except that for purposes of certain covenants in the credit agreement, a pro forma adjustment is made to Consolidated EBITDA in order to give effect to current period acquisitions as though they had been consummated on the first day of the four quarter period presented. The pro forma impact gives effect to all acquisitions in the four quarters ended   September 6, 2016   as though they had been consummated on the first day of the   fourth   quarter of fiscal year   2015  . 
    
  Golf and country club operations consist of private country clubs, golf clubs and public golf facilities. Private country clubs provide at least one 18-hole golf course and various other recreational amenities that are open to members and their guests. Golf clubs provide both private and public golf play and usually offer fewer recreational amenities than private country clubs. Public golf facilities are open to the public and generally provide the same amenities as golf clubs. 
    
  Business, sports and alumni club operations consist of business clubs, business/sports clubs, sports clubs and alumni clubs. Business clubs provide a setting for dining, business or social entertainment. Sports clubs provide a variety of recreational facilities and business/sports clubs provide a combination of the amenities available at business clubs and sports clubs. Alumni clubs provide the same amenities as business clubs while targeting alumni and staff of universities.  
    
  We also disclose corporate expenses and other operations, which consists of other business activities including ancillary revenues related to alliance arrangements, a portion of the revenue associated with upgrade offerings, reimbursements for certain costs of operations at managed clubs, corporate overhead expenses and shared services. Other operations also includes corporate assets such as cash, goodwill, intangible assets, and loan origination fees. While corporate expenses and other operations is not a segment, disclosing corporate expenses and other operations facilitates the reconciliation from segment results to consolidated results. 
    
  The table below shows summarized financial information by segment for the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  :

13. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  GAAP requires that earnings per share ( EPS ) calculations treat unvested share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities (participating securities) and that basic EPS be calculated using the two-class method. We have granted RSAs (as defined below) that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends. Such awards are considered participating securities. The two-class method of computing EPS is an earnings allocation formula that determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. We have also granted RSAs that contain forfeitable rights to dividends. These awards are not considered participating securities and are excluded from the basic weighted-average shares outstanding calculation. 
  Basic EPS is computed utilizing the two-class method and is calculated on weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. 
  Diluted EPS reflects the dilutive effect of equity based awards (potential common shares) that may share in the earnings of ClubCorp when such shares are either issued or vesting restrictions lapse. Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and potential common shares outstanding during the periods presented, utilizing the two-class method for unvested equity-based awards. 
  Presented below is basic and diluted EPS for the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015   (in thousands, except per share amounts): 
  
   25 

The basis for the numerator for earnings per share is Net income (loss) attributable to ClubCorp. The numerator was adjusted by less than   $0.1 million   and approximately   $0.2 million   for the earnings and dividends allocated to participating securities during the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , respectively. There were no material dividends allocated to participating securities during the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . 
    
  Potential common shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS when the effect of their inclusion would reduce our net loss per share and would be anti-dilutive. For the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015   there are   0.1 million   and   0.3 million   potential common shares excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS, respectively.  

14. EQUITY 
  Equity-Based Awards   We have granted equity-based awards to employees and non-employee directors in the form of restricted stock awards ( RSAs ), which restrictions will be removed upon satisfaction of time-based vesting requirements, subject to the holder remaining in continued service with us. We have also granted performance restricted stock units ( PSUs ) and  Adjusted EBITDA-Based PSUs , both of which will convert into shares of our common stock upon satisfaction of (i) time-based vesting requirements and (ii) the applicable performance-based requirements subject to the holder remaining in continued service with us. The number of awards under the PSU and Adjusted EBITDA-Based PSU grants represents the target number of such units that may be earned. The PSU awards performance-based requirements are measured based on Holdings  total shareholder return over the applicable performance periods compared with a peer group. The Adjusted EBITDA-Based PSU awards vest upon the achievement by the 2017 Same Store Clubs (as defined in the form of award), on a consolidated basis, of a specified level of Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2018. We measure the cost of services rendered in exchange for equity-based awards based upon the grant date fair market value of the respective equity-based awards. The value is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The Adjusted EBITDA-Based PSU awards include performance conditions and expense is accrued when achievement of the performance conditions is considered probable. 
    
  The fair market value of each RSA was estimated using Holdings  closing share price on the date of grant. The fair market value of each PSU was estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation analysis which generates a distribution of possible future stock prices for Holdings and the peer group from the grant date to the end of the applicable performance period. The fair market value of each Adjusted EBITDA-Based PSU was estimated using Holdings  closing share price on the date of grant. 
    
  The following table shows total equity-based compensation expense included in the consolidated condensed statements of operations: 

As of   September 6, 2016  , there was approximately   $16.0 million   of unrecognized expense related to non-vested, equity-based awards granted to employees, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   2.0 years  . 

26 

The Amended and Restated ClubCorp Holdings, Inc. 2012 Stock Award Plan (the  Stock Plan ) provides for an aggregate amount of no more than   4.0 million   shares of common stock to be available for awards. The Stock Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance-based awards and other equity-based incentive awards. To date, we have granted RSAs, PSUs, Adjusted EBITDA-Based PSUs and restricted stock units ( RSUs ) under the Stock Plan. As of   September 6, 2016  , approximately   1.2 million   shares of common stock were available for future issuance under the Stock Plan. Treasury stock may be used to settle awards under the Stock Plan. 
    
  The following table summarizes RSA, PSU and Adjusted EBITDA-Based PSU activity for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  :

    Dividends   The following is a summary of dividends declared or paid during the periods presented:  

Share Repurchase Plan   On February 24, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to   $50.0 million   of our common stock with an expiration date of December 31, 2017. The repurchase program may be executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market or privately negotiated transactions, including through plans designed under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , we purchased   25,120   and   129,445   shares under the share repurchase plan, respectively. As of   September 6, 2016  , approximately   $48.5 million   remained authorized under the share repurchase plan. 

15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  We routinely enter into contractual obligations to procure assets used in the day to day operations of our business and to invest in our information technology systems. As of   September 6, 2016  , we had capital commitments of   $22.4 million  . 
    
  We currently have sales and use tax audits in progress. We believe the potential for a liability related to the outcome of these audits may exist. However, we believe that the outcome of these audits would not materially affect our consolidated condensed financial statements. 

27 

Certain of our Mexican subsidiaries are under audit by the Mexican taxing authorities for the   2008   and   2009   tax years. In 2013, we received two assessments, for approximately   $3.0 million   each, exclusive of penalties and interest, for two of our Mexican subsidiaries under audit for the   2008   tax year. We have taken the appropriate procedural steps to contest these assessments through the appropriate Mexican judicial channels. We have not recorded a liability related to these uncertain tax positions as we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail based on the merits of our positions. In 2014, we received an audit assessment for the   2009   tax year for another Mexican subsidiary. We have taken the appropriate procedural steps to contest the assessment through the appropriate Mexican judicial channels. We have recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit for   $4.4 million  , exclusive of penalties and interest, related to this audit. The unrecognized tax benefit has been recorded due to the technical nature of the tax filing position taken by our Mexican subsidiary and uncertainty around the ultimate outcome of this assessment, which we intend to continue to contest. 
    
  We are currently under audit by state income tax authorities. We have received multiple assessments related to such audits and have an immaterial amount recorded within our state income tax payable as of   September 6, 2016  . 
    
  We are subject to certain pending or threatened litigation and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of such legal proceedings and other claims cannot be predicted with certainty, after review and consultation with legal counsel, we believe that any potential liability from these matters would not materially affect our consolidated condensed financial statements.  

16. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  We had receivables of   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million  , as of   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  , respectively, for outstanding advances from a golf club joint venture in which we have an equity method investment. We recorded   $0.1 million   in the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   $0.1 million   in the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , in management fees from this venture. There were no material management fees recorded for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  . As of   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  , we had a receivable of   $3.3 million   and   $3.2 million  , respectively, for volume rebates from Avendra, LLC, the supplier firm in which we have an equity method investment. See Note    4   . 

17. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
    
  On   September 29, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of   $8.5 million  , or   $0.13   per share of common stock, to all common stockholders of record at the close of business on   October 10, 2016  . This dividend is expected to be paid on   October 17, 2016  . 
    
  On   September 30, 2016  , Operations entered into a tenth amendment to the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities to decrease the interest rate on the term loan facility to a variable rate calculated as the higher of (a)   4.0%   or (b) an elected LIBOR plus a margin of   3.0%  .

  Overview 
  We are a leading owner-operator of private golf and country clubs and business, sports and alumni clubs in North America. As of   September 6, 2016  , our portfolio of   208   owned or operated clubs, with approximately   186,000   memberships, served over   430,000   individual members. Our operations are organized into two principal business segments: (1) golf and country clubs and (2) business, sports and alumni clubs. We own, lease or operate through joint ventures   151   golf and country clubs and manage   nine   golf and country clubs. Likewise, we own, lease or operate through a joint venture   45   business, sports and alumni clubs and manage   three   business, sports and alumni clubs. We are the largest owner of private golf and country clubs in the United States and own the underlying real estate for   127   of our   160   golf and country clubs. Our golf and country clubs include   135   private country clubs,   16   semi-private clubs and   nine   public golf courses. Our business, sports and alumni clubs include   30   business clubs,   10   business and sports clubs,   six   alumni clubs, and   two   sports clubs. Our facilities are located in   26   states, the District of Columbia and   two   foreign countries. 
    
  Our golf and country clubs are designed to appeal to the entire family, fostering member loyalty which we believe allows us to capture a greater share of our member households  discretionary leisure spending. Our business, sports and alumni clubs are designed to provide our members with private upscale locations where they can work, network and socialize. We offer our members privileges throughout our entire collection of clubs, and we believe that our diverse facilities, recreational offerings and social programming enhance our ability to attract and retain members across a number of demographic groups. We also have alliances with other clubs, resorts and facilities located worldwide through which our members can enjoy additional access, discounts, special offerings and privileges outside of our owned and operated clubs. Given the breadth of our products, services and amenities, we believe we offer a compelling value proposition to our members. 
    
  Factors Affecting our Business  
    
  A significant percentage of our revenue is derived from membership dues, and we believe these dues together with the geographic diversity of our clubs help to provide us with a recurring revenue base that limits the impact of fluctuations in regional economic conditions. We believe our efforts to position our clubs as focal points in communities with offerings that can appeal to the entire family has enhanced member loyalty and mitigated attrition rates in our membership base compared to the industry as a whole. 
  We believe the strength and size of our portfolio of clubs combined with the stability of our mass affluent membership base will enable us to maintain our position as an industry leader in the future. As the largest owner-operator of private golf and country clubs in the United States, we enjoy economies of scale and a leadership position. We expect to strategically expand and upgrade our portfolio through acquisitions and targeted capital investments. As part of our targeted capital investment program, we plan to focus on facility changes and upgrades to improve our members  experience and the utilization of our facilities and amenities, which we believe will yield positive financial results. 
  Enrollment and Retention of Members 
    
  Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain members at our clubs and maintain or increase usage of our facilities. Historically, we have experienced varying levels of membership enrollment and attrition rates and, in certain areas, decreased levels of usage of our facilities. We devote substantial efforts to maintaining member and guest satisfaction, although many of the factors affecting club membership and facility usage are beyond our control. 

31 

We offer various programs at our clubs designed to minimize future attrition rates by increasing member satisfaction and usage. These include programs that are designed to engage current and newly enrolled members in activities and groups that go beyond their home club. Additionally, these programs may grant our members discounts on meals and other items in order to increase their familiarity with and usage of their club s amenities. One such program is our Optimal Network Experiences program ( O.N.E. ), an upgrade product that combines what we refer to as  comprehensive club, community and world benefits . With this offering, members typically receive   50%   off a la carte dining at their home club; preferential offerings to clubs in their community (including those owned by us), as well as at local spas, restaurants and other venues; and complimentary privileges currently to more than   300   golf and country, business, sporting and athletic clubs when traveling outside of their community with additional offerings and discounts to more than   1,000   renowned hotels, resorts, restaurants and entertainment venues. As of   September 6, 2016  , approximately   54%   of our memberships were enrolled in one or more of our upgrade programs, as compared to approximately   50%   of memberships that were enrolled in one or more of our upgrade programs as of   December 29, 2015  . As of   September 6, 2016  ,   154   of our clubs offered O.N.E., compared to   152   as of   December 29, 2015  . 
    
  The following tables present our membership counts for clubs which we own, lease or operate through a joint venture, excluding managed clubs, at the end of the periods indicated.  

_______________________ 
    
           (1) 
    Membership counts exclude memberships at managed clubs. As of   September 6, 2016  , we had   9,238   memberships at managed clubs, including   3,885   memberships at golf and country clubs and   5,353   memberships at business, sports and alumni clubs, excluding certain international club memberships. 
       
  Seasonality of Demand and Fluctuations in Quarterly Results 
    
  The first, second and third fiscal quarters each consist of twelve weeks, whereas, the fourth quarter consists of sixteen or seventeen weeks of operations. Our business clubs typically generate a greater share of their yearly revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday and year-end party season. Usage of our golf and country club facilities typically declines significantly during the first and fourth fiscal quarters, when colder temperatures and shorter days reduce the demand for golf and golf-related activities. As a result of these factors, we usually generate a disproportionate share of our revenues and cash flows in the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters of each year and have lower revenues and cash flows in the first quarter. In addition, the timing of purchases, sales, leasing of facilities or divestitures, has caused and may cause our results of operations to vary significantly in otherwise comparable periods. To clarify variations caused by newly acquired or divested operations, we employ a same store analysis for year-over-year comparability purposes. See  Basis of Presentation Same Store Analysis . 
    
  Our results can also be affected by non-seasonal and severe weather patterns. Periods of extremely hot, dry, cold or rainy weather in a given region can be expected to impact our golf-related revenue for that region. For example, during the twelve weeks ended June 14, 2016 we experienced unusual amounts of rain and flooding events at our clubs in the Houston, Texas market, which negatively impacted our golf-related revenue in the market. Additionally, a significant amount of capital expenditure will be required to fully repair the impacted clubs, a portion of which has already been incurred. The majority of this capital expenditure is expected to be offset by insurance proceeds, a portion of which has already been received, resulting in an insignificant impact to our net cash flows used for investing activities for the rest of the year. Similarly, extended periods of low rainfall can affect the cost and availability of water needed to irrigate our golf courses and can adversely affect results for facilities in the impacted region. Keeping turf grass conditions at a satisfactory level to attract play on our golf courses requires significant amounts of water. Our ability to irrigate a course could be adversely impacted by a drought or other water shortage, which we have experienced from time to time. A severe drought affecting a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
    
  Further, the timing of distributions from our equity method investments, including Avendra, LLC, a purchasing cooperative of hospitality companies, varies due to factors outside of our control. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in Note    12    of our consolidated condensed financial statements included elsewhere herein, is impacted when cash distributions from equity method investments vary from the equity in earnings recognized for the related investments. 

32 

Reinvention Capital Investments  
    
    We continue to identify and prioritize capital projects and believe the reinvention of our clubs through strategic capital investments help drive membership sales, facility usage and member retention. A significant portion of our invested capital is used to add reinvention elements to  major reinvention  clubs, defined as clubs receiving   $750,000   or more gross capital spend on a project basis, as we believe these discretionary club enhancements represent opportunities to increase revenues and generate a positive return on our investment, although we cannot guarantee such returns. Elements of reinvention capital expenditures include  Touchdown Rooms , which are small private meeting rooms allowing members to hold impromptu private meetings while leveraging the other services of their club.  Anytime Lounges  provide a contemporary and casual atmosphere to work and network, while  Media Rooms  provide state-of-the-art facilities to enjoy various forms of entertainment. Additional reinvention elements include refitted fitness centers, enhanced pool area amenities such as shade cabanas, pool slides and splash pads, redesigned golf practice areas for use by beginners to avid golfers, and newly created or updated indoor and outdoor dining and social gathering areas designed to take advantage of the expansive views and natural beauty of our clubs. 
    
  Club Acquisitions and Dispositions  
       
  We continually explore opportunities to expand our business through select acquisitions of attractive properties. We also evaluate joint ventures and management opportunities that allow us to expand our operations and increase our recurring revenue base without substantial capital outlay. We believe that the fragmented nature of the private club industry presents significant opportunities for us to expand our portfolio by leveraging our operational expertise and by taking advantage of market conditions.  
    
  The table below summarizes the number and type of club acquisitions and dispositions during the periods indicated:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated condensed financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. We base these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available to us at the time the estimates or assumptions are made. Accordingly, our actual results could differ materially from our estimates. The most significant estimates made by management include the expected life of an active membership over which we amortize initiation fees and deposits, our incremental borrowing rate which is used to accrete membership initiation deposit liabilities, assumptions and judgments used in estimating unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions and inputs for impairment testing of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets. 
    
  For additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the disclosure included in our 2015 Annual Report.

Basis of Presentation  
    
  Total revenues recorded in our two principal business segments: (1) golf and country clubs and (2) business, sports and alumni clubs, are comprised mainly of revenues from membership dues (including upgrade dues), food and beverage operations and golf operations. Operating expenses recorded in our two principal business segments primarily consist of labor expenses, food and beverage costs, golf course maintenance costs and general and administrative costs.  
    
  We also disclose corporate expenses and other operations, which consists of other business activities including ancillary revenues related to alliance arrangements, a portion of the revenue associated with upgrade offerings, reimbursements for certain costs of operations at managed clubs, corporate overhead expenses and shared services. Corporate expenses and other operations also includes corporate assets such as cash, goodwill, intangible assets, and loan origination fees. 
    
  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
    
    Adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure used by our management to (1) internally measure our operating performance, (2) evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and support certain valuation analyses and (3) assess our ability to service our debt, incur additional debt, make acquisitions, pay dividends and make capital expenditures. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and lenders as a performance measure because it adjusts our operating results to be reflective of our core, ongoing, operating performance. As such, Adjusted EBITDA provides relevant information about trends for the periods presented and adjusts for the impact of certain items on a consistent basis from period to period. We believe this measure allows investors and lenders to evaluate performance using the same metrics that management uses to evaluate performance and plan annual budgets. We also believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful     as a liquidity measure because it demonstrates our ability to service our debt, incur additional debt, make acquisitions, pay dividends and make capital expenditures. See Note    12    of our consolidated condensed financial statements included elsewhere herein for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA.

Certain other adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by operating activities are not included as they are excluded from both net cash provided by operating activities and Adjusted EBITDA. 
       
  Same Store Analysis    
    
  We employ  same store  analysis techniques for a variety of management purposes. By our definition, clubs are evaluated at the beginning of each year and considered same store once they have been fully operational for one fiscal year. Newly acquired or opened clubs, clubs added under management agreements and divested clubs are not classified as same store; however, clubs held for sale are considered same store until they are divested. Once a club has been divested, it is removed from the same store classification for all periods presented. See summarized financial information by segment in Note    12    of our consolidated condensed financial statements included elsewhere herein. For same store year-over-year comparisons, clubs must be open the entire year for both years in the comparison to be considered same store, therefore, same store facility counts and operating results may vary depending on the years of comparison. We believe this approach provides for a more effective analysis tool because it allows us to assess the results of our core operating strategies by tracking the performance of our established same store clubs without the inclusion of divested clubs and newly acquired or opened clubs.  
    
  Our fiscal year consists of a 52/53 week period ending on the last Tuesday of December. Our first, second and third fiscal quarters each consist of twelve weeks while our fourth fiscal quarter consists of sixteen or seventeen weeks.

Comparison of the   Twelve Weeks Ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015    
    
  The following table presents key financial information derived from our consolidated condensed statements of operations for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  . 

__________________________ 
    
           (1)    
    Comprised of club operating costs, cost of food and beverage sales and provision for doubtful accounts. 
       
  Total revenues of   $259.3 million   for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   increased   $4.0 million  , or   1.6%  , over the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , largely due to   $5.0 million   of revenue attributable to club properties added in 2015 and 2016. Same store golf and country club revenue increased by   $1.0 million   driven primarily by increases in same store dues which were partially offset by decreases in golf operations and other revenue. These factors are discussed below under  Segment Operations Golf and Country Clubs . In addition, our same store business, sports and alumni club segment revenue increased slightly, by   $0.2 million  . The results are discussed below under  Segment Operations Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs . The remaining change is primarily related to a   $2.6 million   decrease in revenue related to divested clubs, including management fees and reimbursements for certain operating costs at managed clubs. 
    
  Club operating costs and expenses totaling   $194.3 million   for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   increased   $1.2 million  , or   0.6%  , compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . The increase is largely due to   $4.2 million   of club operating costs and expenses from club properties added in 2015 and 2016 and a   $0.5 million   increase in equity-based compensation offset by a   $1.5 million   decrease in costs related to divested clubs and a   $0.8 million   decrease in rent expense. The remaining decrease is largely related to   $1.1 million   in certain operating costs at divested managed clubs, which are offset by reimbursements recorded within revenue, resulting in no net impact on operating income.   
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased   $0.6 million  , or   2.5%  , during the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . Depreciation expense increased   $1.0 million   due to our increased fixed asset balances primarily related to club acquisitions, along with the related impact of reinvention and expansion capital spend. Amortization expense decreased   $0.4 million   largely due to the termination of club management agreements. During the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , depreciation and amortization for Golf and Country Clubs and Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs was   $20.3 million   and   $2.8 million  , respectively. During the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , depreciation and amortization for Golf and Country Clubs and Business, Sports and Alumni clubs was   $19.9 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively. These expenses were primarily made up of depreciation on our property and equipment and amortization of intangibles related to management contracts. 

39 

Loss on disposal of assets for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015   of   $1.1 million   and   $3.6 million  , respectively, were largely comprised of losses on asset retirements during the normal course of business, including property and equipment disposed of in connection with our increased capital spend on reinventions and renovations. During the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , our losses were reduced by   $4.0 million   of insurance proceeds received in conjunction with the rain and flooding events that occurred during the year, primarily at our clubs in the Houston, Texas market. During the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , loss on disposal of assets for Golf and Country Clubs and Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs was   $0.5 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively. During the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , loss on disposal of assets for Golf and Country Clubs and Business, Sports and Alumni clubs was   $3.5 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively. These expenses related primarily to asset retirements associated with our club reinventions and in the ordinary course of business. 
    
  We recognize the earnings of one of our unconsolidated ventures, Avendra, LLC, within equity in earnings or within interest and investment income, depending on the timing of cash distributions and the investment balance. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated ventures was   $1.2 million   and a loss of   $0.5 million   for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively. Interest and investment income decreased   $2.0 million   to   $0.2 million   in the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , due primarily to earnings on our Avendra, LLC equity investment recorded to investment income in the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015   while no earnings on our Avendra, LLC equity investment were recorded to investment income in the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016  . 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses of   $15.4 million   for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   increased slightly, by   0.2%  , compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . The major components of selling, general and administrative expenses are shown in the table below. 

______________________ 
    
           (1) 
    Selling, general and administrative expense, excluding equity-based compensation and capital structure costs, is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this measure is informative to investors because excluding capital structure costs and equity-based compensation will allow investors to more meaningfully compare our results between periods.  
       
  Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and capital structure costs, were   $14.2 million   for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , an increase of   $0.3 million  , or   2.3%  , compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . This included an increase of   $1.1 million   in costs primarily related to the design phase of our centralization of administrative processes and a   $0.5 million   increase in severance expense. These increases were offset by a   $1.1 million   decrease in incentive compensation and a   $0.2 million   decrease in acquisition costs.  
    
  Capital structure costs included within selling, general and administrative expenses of   $0.1 million   and   $0.5 million   during the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively, were comprised of costs related to amendments to the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities. 

40 

Interest expense totaled   $20.2 million   and   $16.2 million   for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively. The   $4.0 million   increase in interest expense is primarily comprised of an increase of   $6.6 million   in interest due to the issuance of the 2015 Senior Notes offset by a   $2.2 million   decrease in interest on the term loan facility due to a lower principal balance outstanding during the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . During the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , interest expense for Golf and Country Clubs and Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs was   $4.8 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively. During the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , interest expense for Golf and Country Clubs and Business, Sports and Alumni clubs was   $4.8 million   and   $1.2 million  , respectively. The interest expense for Golf and Country Clubs was primarily driven by accretion expense related to membership initiation payments along with interest expense related to various mortgage loans. The interest expense for Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs was primarily driven by accretion expense related to membership initiation payments.  
    
  Income tax expense for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   increased   $0.4 million   compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , and the effective tax rates were   57.3%   and   63.0%   for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively. The amount of tax expense or benefit recognized in interim financial statements is determined by multiplying the year-to-date pre-tax income or loss by the annual effective tax rate, which is an estimate of the expected relationship between tax expense or benefit for the full year to the pre-tax income or loss for the full year (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items). For the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , the effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal rate of   35.0%   primarily due to state taxes and certain other permanent differences. The relative impact these items have on the effective tax rate varies based on the forecasted amount of pre-tax income or loss for the year. 
    
  Segment Operations  
    
  The following table presents key financial information for our segments and Adjusted EBITDA for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  :

Golf and Country Clubs 
    
  The following table presents key financial information for our golf and country clubs for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . Divested clubs are excluded from segment reporting for all periods presented. References to percentage changes that are not meaningful, as new or acquired clubs include different clubs for each period, are denoted by   NM  . 

Total revenue for same store golf and country clubs increased   $1.0 million  , or   0.5%  , for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015   due primarily to increases in same store dues offset by decreases in golf operations and other revenue. Same store dues revenue increased   $2.8 million  , or   3.0%  , due primarily to a rate increase in dues per same store average membership and greater participation in the O.N.E. program. Golf operations revenue decreased   $1.5 million  , or   3.0%  , due to lower greens fees, cart fees, and retail sales. Golf operations revenue and food and beverage a la carte revenue were negatively impacted by post-flood remediation of Houston clubs, construction projects and increased rainfall compared to prior year in certain areas. Other revenue decreased   $0.4 million  , or   2.9%  , largely due to lower revenue recognized for membership initiation payments which are being recognized into revenue over the expected lives of active memberships. 
    
  Club operating costs and expenses include costs such as payroll and payroll related expenses, costs of food and beverage sales, costs of retail sales, golf operations and golf course maintenance expenses, utilities and property taxes. Club operating costs and expenses, excluding costs of food and beverage sales, for same store golf and country clubs increased   $0.1 million  , or   0.1%  , for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  .  These operating costs, as a percentage of total same store club revenue, were   63.0%   and   63.3%   for the same periods, respectively. 
  Costs of food and beverage sales for same store golf and country clubs were flat for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , consistent with food and beverage sales. These costs, as a percentage of food and beverage revenues, were   37.0%   and   37.1%   for the same periods, respectively. 
  
   42 

Adjusted EBITDA for same store golf and country clubs increased   $0.9 million  , or   1.6%  , for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , largely due to the increase in higher margin dues revenue combined with well controlled variable operating costs and expenses. As a result, same store Adjusted EBITDA margin for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   increased   30   basis points over the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . 
    
  Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs 
    
  The following table presents key financial information for our business, sports and alumni clubs for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . Divested clubs are excluded from segment reporting for all periods presented. References to percentage changes that are not meaningful, as new or acquired clubs include different clubs for each period, are denoted by   NM  . 

Total revenues for same store business, sports and alumni clubs increased   $0.2 million  , or   0.4%  , for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015   primarily due to increases in food and beverage revenue and same store dues. Food and beverage revenue increased   $0.2 million  , or   0.8%  , due primarily to an increase in private party revenue, partially offset by a decrease in a la carte revenue. Dues revenue increased   $0.2 million  , or   0.8%  , due primarily to an increase in upgrade dues related to the O.N.E program. 
    
  Club operating costs and expenses include costs such as payroll and payroll related expenses, costs of food and beverage sales and rent. Club operating costs and expenses, excluding costs of food and beverage sales, for same store business, sports and alumni clubs decreased   $0.7 million  , or   2.4%  , for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . The decrease is largely due to a decrease in fixed costs, primarily rent expense, and a decrease in incentive compensation. These operating costs, as a percentage of total same store club revenue, were   69.4%   and   71.3%   for the same periods, respectively. 

43 

Costs of food and beverage sales for same store business, sports and alumni clubs were flat for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , consistent with food and beverage sales, which increased slightly. These costs, as a percentage of food and beverage revenues, were   29.8%   and   29.9%   for the same periods, respectively. 
  Adjusted EBITDA for same store business, sports and alumni clubs increased   $0.8 million  , or   13.4%  , for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , primarily due to increases in food and beverage revenue and higher margin dues revenue combined with well controlled variable operating costs and expenses. Same store Adjusted EBITDA margin for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   increased   200   basis points compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . 
    
  Corporate expenses and other operations 
    
  The following table presents financial information for corporate expenses and other operations, which is comprised primarily of activities not related to our two business segments, for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  . 

Corporate expenses and other operations improved   $1.5 million  , or   16.1%  , for the   twelve weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   twelve weeks ended     September 8, 2015   due to a   $1.1 million   decrease in incentive compensation, a   $0.3 million   decrease in insurance expense related to lower claims and a   $0.3 million   increase in net volume rebates and allowances and cash distributions from our equity method investments, which are subject to timing.

Comparison of the   Thirty-Six Weeks Ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015    
    
  The following table presents key financial information derived from our consolidated condensed statements of operations for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  . 

__________________________ 
    
           (1)    
    Comprised of club operating costs, cost of food and beverage sales and provision for doubtful accounts. 
       
  Total revenues of   $743.2 million   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   increased   $22.0 million  , or   3.1%  , over the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , largely due to   $17.6 million   of revenue attributable to club properties added in 2015 and 2016. Same store golf and country club revenue increased by   $10.2 million   driven primarily by increases in same store dues and food and beverage revenue offset by decreases in golf operations and other revenue. These factors are discussed below under  Segment Operations Golf and Country Clubs . In addition, our same store business, sports and alumni club segment revenue increased   $1.9 million   primarily due to increases in same store dues and food and beverage revenue. These factors are discussed below under  Segment Operations Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs . The remaining change is primarily related to an   $8.4 million   decrease in revenue related to divested clubs, including management fees and reimbursements for certain operating costs at managed clubs. 
    
  Club operating costs and expenses totaling   $552.3 million   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   increased   $10.3 million  , or   1.9%  , compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . The increase is largely due to   $14.4 million   of club operating costs and expenses from club properties added in 2015 and 2016, a   $2.6 million   increase in variable labor costs and food and beverage cost of goods sold associated with higher revenues, a   $1.7 million   increase in insurance expense related to higher claims and a   $1.0 million   increase in equity-based compensation offset by a   $4.2 million   decrease in costs related to divested clubs, a   $1.1 million   decrease in utilities expense and a   $0.9 million   decrease in incentive compensation. The remaining decrease is largely related to   $3.8 million   in certain operating costs at divested managed clubs, which are offset by reimbursements recorded within revenue, resulting in no net impact on operating income. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased   $2.1 million  , or   3.0%  , during the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . Depreciation expense increased   $2.8 million   due to our increased fixed asset balances primarily related to club acquisitions, along with the related impact of reinvention and expansion capital spend. Amortization expense decreased   $0.7 million   largely due to the termination of club management agreements. During the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , depreciation and amortization for Golf and Country Clubs and Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs was   $59.9 million   and   $8.2 million  , respectively. During the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , depreciation and amortization for Golf and Country Clubs and Business, Sports and Alumni clubs was   $58.2 million   and   $8.0 million  , respectively. These expenses were primarily made up of depreciation on our property and equipment and amortization of intangibles related to management contracts.

Loss on disposal of assets for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015   of   $6.7 million   and   $13.3 million  , respectively, were largely comprised of losses on asset retirements during the normal course of business, including property and equipment disposed of in connection with our increased capital spend on reinventions and renovations. During the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , our losses were offset by   $4.4 million   of insurance proceeds received in conjunction with the rain and flooding events that occurred during the year, primarily at our clubs in the Houston, Texas market. During the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , loss on disposal of assets for Golf and Country Clubs and Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs was   $5.5 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively. During the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , loss on disposal of assets for Golf and Country Clubs and Business, Sports and Alumni clubs was   $12.5 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively. These expenses related primarily to asset retirements associated with our club reinventions and in the ordinary course of business. 
    
  We recognize the earnings of one of our unconsolidated ventures, Avendra, LLC, within equity in earnings or within interest and investment income, depending on the timing of cash distributions and the investment balance. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated ventures was   $3.3 million   and a loss of   $0.9 million   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively. Interest and investment income decreased   $3.4 million   to   $0.4 million   in the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , due primarily to earnings on our Avendra, LLC equity investment recorded to investment income in the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015   while no earnings on our Avendra, LLC equity investment were recorded to investment income in the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  . 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses of   $52.6 million   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   increased   $2.6 million  , or   5.2%  , compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . The major components of selling, general and administrative expenses are shown in the table below. 

______________________ 
    
           (1) 
    Selling, general and administrative expense, excluding equity-based compensation and capital structure costs, is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this measure is informative to investors because excluding capital structure costs and equity-based compensation will allow investors to more meaningfully compare our results between periods.  
       
  Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and capital structure costs, were   $48.7 million   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , an increase of   $3.1 million  , or   6.8%  , compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . This included increased costs of   $3.1 million   related to the design phase of our centralization of administrative processes and costs related to our initial compliance with SOX 404(b), which were primarily incurred during the twelve weeks ended March 22, 2016 and a   $0.6 million   increase in severance expense. We also incurred an increase of   $1.9 million   due to higher ongoing support costs, including professional fees, payroll, costs related to software agreements and service fees, as part of our compliance with SOX 404(b) and centralization of administrative processes. These increases were offset by a   $1.4 million   decrease in acquisition costs and a   $0.9 million   decrease in incentive compensation. 
    
  Capital structure costs included within selling, general and administrative expenses of   $1.0 million   and   $1.8 million   during the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively, were comprised of costs related to amendments to the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities. 

46 

Interest expense totaled   $60.5 million   and   $48.6 million   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively. The   $11.9 million   increase in interest expense is primarily comprised of an increase of   $19.9 million   in interest due to the issuance of the 2015 Senior Notes offset by a   $7.7 million   decrease in interest on the term loan facility due primarily to a lower principal balance outstanding during the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . During the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , interest expense for Golf and Country Clubs and Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs was   $14.1 million   and   $3.0 million  , respectively. During the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , interest expense for Golf and Country Clubs and Business, Sports and Alumni clubs was   $14.0 million   and   $3.5 million  , respectively. The interest expense for Golf and Country Clubs was primarily driven by accretion expense related to membership initiation payments along with interest expense related to various mortgage loans. The interest expense for Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs was primarily driven by accretion expense related to membership initiation payments.  
    
  Income tax benefit for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   increased   $0.3 million   compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , and the effective tax rates were   (9.9)%   and   5.4%   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively. The amount of tax expense or benefit recognized in interim financial statements is determined by multiplying the year-to-date pre-tax income or loss by the annual effective tax rate, which is an estimate of the expected relationship between tax expense or benefit for the full year to the pre-tax income or loss for the full year (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items). For the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , the effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal rate of   35.0%   primarily due to state taxes and certain other permanent differences. The relative impact these items have on the effective tax rate varies based on the forecasted amount of pre-tax income or loss for the year.

Golf and Country Clubs 
    
  The following table presents key financial information for our golf and country clubs for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . Divested clubs are excluded from segment reporting for all periods presented. References to percentage changes that are not meaningful, as new or acquired clubs include different clubs for each period, are denoted by   NM  . 

Total revenue for same store golf and country clubs increased   $10.2 million  , or   1.8%  , for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015   due primarily to increases in same store dues and food and beverage revenue offset by decreases in golf operations revenue and other revenue. Same store dues revenue increased   $9.8 million  , or   3.6%  , due primarily to greater participation in the O.N.E. program and a rate increase in dues per same store average membership. Food and beverage revenue increased   $2.8 million  , or   2.2%  , due primarily to a   2.8%   increase in private party revenue and a   2.6%   increase in a la carte revenue. Golf operations revenue, which decreased   $1.4 million  , or   1.1%  , was negatively impacted during the twelve weeks ended June 14, 2016, by inclement weather, primarily in the Houston, Texas market, and negatively impacted during the twelve weeks ended September 6, 2016 by post-flood remediation of Houston clubs, construction projects and increased rainfall compared to prior year in certain areas. Other revenue decreased   $0.9 million  , or   2.2%  , largely due to lower revenue recognized for membership initiation payments which are being recognized into revenue over the expected lives of active memberships. 
    
  Club operating costs and expenses include costs such as payroll and payroll related expenses, costs of food and beverage sales, costs of retail sales, golf operations and golf course maintenance expenses, utilities and property taxes. Club operating costs and expenses, excluding costs of food and beverage sales, for same store golf and country clubs increased   $0.7 million  , or   0.2%  , for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . The increase is primarily related to higher golf course maintenance expenses, partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. These operating costs, as a percentage of total same store club revenue, were   62.0%   and   63.0%   for the same periods, respectively. 
  
   48 

Costs of food and beverage sales for same store golf and country clubs increased   $1.1 million  , or   2.5%  , for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , due primarily to increases in food and beverage sales. These costs, as a percentage of food and beverage revenues, were   36.4%   and   36.3%   for the same periods, respectively. 
  Adjusted EBITDA for same store golf and country clubs increased   $8.4 million  , or   5.1%  , for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , largely due to the increase in higher margin dues revenue and increased food and beverage revenue combined with well controlled variable operating costs and expenses. As a result, same store Adjusted EBITDA margin for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   increased   100   basis points over the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  .

References to percentage changes that are not meaningful, as new or acquired clubs include different clubs for each period, are denoted by   NM  . 

Total revenues for same store business, sports and alumni clubs increased   $1.9 million  , or   1.5%  , for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015   primarily due to increases in same store dues and food and beverage revenue. Dues revenue increased   $1.3 million  , or   2.3%  , due primarily to an increase in upgrade dues related to the O.N.E program. Food and beverage revenue increased   $0.8 million  , or   1.3%  , due primarily to an increase in private party revenue, partially offset by a decrease in a la carte revenue. 

49 

Club operating costs and expenses include costs such as payroll and payroll related expenses, costs of food and beverage sales and rent. Club operating costs and expenses, excluding costs of food and beverage sales, for same store business, sports and alumni clubs decreased   $0.3 million  , or   0.3%  , for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . The decrease is largely due to a decrease in fixed costs, primarily rent expense, and a decrease in incentive compensation. These operating costs, as a percentage of total same store club revenue, were   66.9%   and   68.1%   for the same periods, respectively. 
    
  Costs of food and beverage sales for same store business, sports and alumni clubs increased   $0.3 million  , or   1.5%  , for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , due primarily to increases in food and beverage sales.

  Adjusted EBITDA for same store business, sports and alumni clubs increased   $1.9 million  , or   8.4%  , for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , largely due to the increases in higher margin dues revenue and food and beverage revenue and lower fixed costs. Same store Adjusted EBITDA margin for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   increased   120   basis points compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . 
    
  Corporate expenses and other operations 
    
  The following table presents financial information for corporate expenses and other operations, which is comprised primarily of activities not related to our two business segments, for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  . 

Corporate expenses and other operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased   $3.1 million  , or   9.2%  , for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   compared to the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015   largely due to a   $2.4 million   increase in insurance expense related to higher claims and an increase of   $1.9 million   in ongoing support costs, including professional fees, payroll, costs related to software agreements and service fees, as part of our compliance with SOX 404(b) and centralization of administrative processes. These increases in expenses were offset by a   $0.9 million   decrease in incentive compensation and a   $0.7 million   increase in net volume rebates and allowances and cash distributions from our equity method investments, which are subject to timing. The remaining change was primarily comprised of a   $0.2 million   increase in other corporate expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
    
  We operate through our subsidiaries and have no material assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. Our ability to pay dividends is dependent on our receipt of dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries and borrowings under the Secured Credit Facilities, the 2015 Senior Notes and other debt instruments.  
    
  Our primary goal as it relates to liquidity and capital resources is to attain and retain the right level of debt and cash to execute strategic objectives, maintain and fund expansions, replacement projects and other capital investments at our clubs, be poised for external growth and pay dividends to our stockholders. Historically, we have financed our business through cash flows from operations and debt. 
    
  We anticipate that cash flows from operations will be our primary source of cash over the next twelve months. We believe current assets and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, payment of a quarterly cash dividend pursuant to our dividend policy and stock repurchases. The payment of such quarterly dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to $50 million of our common stock with an expiration date of December 31, 2017. The repurchase program may be executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market or privately negotiated transactions, including through plans designed under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We may also, from time to time in our sole discretion, purchase, redeem or retire our 2015 Senior Notes, through tender offers, in privately negotiated or open market transactions or otherwise. We plan to use excess cash reserves, our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of debt  
  
   50 

or equity, or a combination thereof to expand the business through capital improvement and expansion projects and strategically selected club acquisitions. 
    
  As of   September 6, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents totaled   $92.1 million   and we had   $145.0 million   available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility of the Secured Credit Facilities for total liquidity of   $237.1 million  . As of   October 7, 2016  , we had   $145.0 million   available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.  
    
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  Cash flows from operations totaled   $97.9 million   and   $98.6 million   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively. The   $0.7 million   decrease in operating cash flows is due largely to a   $6.5 million   decrease due to changes in working capital primarily driven by timing of certain trade payables and member billing cycles, a   $4.5 million   increase due to the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities, a decrease in earnings of approximately   $2.6 million  , after excluding loss on disposals of assets, earnings from equity investments, gain on investment in unconsolidated ventures and depreciation expense, each of which do not impact operating cash flows, and a   $2.6 million   increase due to the change in other long-term liabilities. 
    
  Cash Flows used in Investing Activities 
    
  Cash flows used in investing activities totaled   $78.4 million   and   $131.5 million   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively. The   $53.1 million   decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to the   $46.1 million   decrease in cash used for the acquisition of clubs,   $4.4 million   of insurance proceeds related to rain and flooding events that occurred during the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , and a   $2.6 million   decrease in capital spent to maintain, renovate and reinvent our existing properties.  
    
  Cash Flows used in Financing Activities 
    
  Cash flows used in financing activities totaled   $44.2 million   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and cash flows provided by financing activities totaled   $5.2 million   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . During the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  , we borrowed   $57.0 million   and repaid   $10.0 million   of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility during the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  . We made scheduled debt repayments of   $14.0 million   during the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , which was a   $2.0 million   increase from the   $12.0 million   of scheduled debt repayments made during the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 8, 2015  . During the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , we entered into a new secured mortgage loan with a principal amount of   $37.0 million  , the net proceeds of which were primarily used to repay outstanding balances on the existing mortgage loans of   $35.3 million  . Additionally, in the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , we repurchased   129,445   shares of common stock, totaling   $1.5 million  , under our share repurchase plan initiated in   2016  .  
    
  Capital Spending 
    
  The nature of our business requires us to invest capital to maintain our existing properties and invest in our information technology systems. For the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , we spent approximately   $38.1 million   (net of insurance proceeds of   $4.4 million  ) and   $41.1 million  , respectively, in capitalized costs to maintain our existing properties and invest in our information technology systems. During the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , this spending included   $28.1 million  , net of insurance proceeds, to maintain our existing properties and   $1.5 million   to maintain our existing information technology systems. Additionally, we invested   $8.5 million   on information technology projects related to the centralization of administrative processes. During the remainder of fiscal year 2016, we anticipate spending approximately   $21.4 million   in maintenance capital, net of insurance proceeds, including   $10.6 million   to maintain our existing facilities and   $2.8 million   to maintain our existing information technology systems. Additionally, we anticipate investing   $8.0 million   on information technology projects related to the centralization of administrative processes. 
    
  In addition to maintaining our properties, we also spend discretionary capital to expand and improve existing properties, including major reinventions, and expand our business through acquisitions. Capital expansion funding totaled approximately   $40.8 million   and   $90.9 million   for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015  , respectively, including acquisitions of   $9.8 million   and   $55.9 million  . We anticipate spending approximately   $12.8 million   on reinvention and expansion projects during the remainder of fiscal year 2016, including capital associated with recently acquired clubs, but excluding any potential future acquisitions and reinvention and expansion projects related to such acquisitions. 

51 

Future discretionary capital spending amounts may increase or decrease as a result of a variety of factors, including but not limited to those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2015 Annual Report, such as the identification of additional acquisitions or expansion opportunities that fit our strategy to expand the business. 
    
  Debt 
    
  Secured Credit Facilities   In 2010, Operations entered into the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities. The credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities was subsequently amended in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Subsequent to   September 6, 2016  , on   September 30, 2016  , Operations entered into a tenth amendment to the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities to decrease the interest rate on the term loan facility to a variable rate calculated as the higher of (a)   4.0%   or (b) an elected LIBOR plus a margin of   3.0%  . As of   October 7, 2016  , the Secured Credit Facilities are comprised of (i) a   $675.0 million   term loan facility and (ii) a revolving credit facility with capacity of   $175.0 million   and   $145.0 million   available for borrowing after deducting   $30.0 million   of standby letters of credit. In addition, the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities includes capacity which provides, subject to lender participation, for additional borrowings in revolving or term loan commitments of   $125.0 million  , and additional borrowings thereafter so long as the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio does not exceed   3.50  :1.00. 
    
  As of   October 7, 2016  , the interest rate on the term loan facility is a variable rate calculated as the higher of (i)   4.0%   or (ii) an elected LIBOR plus a margin of   3.0%   and the maturity date of the term loan facility is   December 15, 2022  . 
       
  As of   October 7, 2016  , the revolving credit commitments mature on   January 25, 2021   and borrowings thereunder bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of   3.0%   per annum. We are required to pay a commitment fee on all undrawn amounts under the revolving credit facility and a fee on all outstanding letters of credit, payable quarterly in arrears. 
    
   As long as commitments are outstanding under the revolving credit facility, we are subject to the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio and the Total Leverage Ratio. The Senior Secured Leverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of Operations  Consolidated Senior Secured Debt (exclusive of the 2015 Senior Notes) to Consolidated EBITDA (disclosed as Adjusted EBITDA and defined in Note    12    of our consolidated condensed financial statements included elsewhere herein) and is calculated on a pro forma basis, giving effect to current period acquisitions as though they had been consummated on the first day of the period presented. The Total Leverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of Operations  Consolidated Total Debt (including the 2015 Senior Notes) to Consolidated EBITDA and is also calculated on a pro forma basis. The credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities requires us to maintain the Total Leverage Ratio of no greater than   5.75  :1.00 and the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio no greater than   4.50  :1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. 
    
  We may be required to prepay the outstanding term loan facility by a percentage of excess cash flows, as defined by the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities, each fiscal year end after our annual consolidated financial statements are delivered, which percentage may decrease or be eliminated depending on the results of the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio test at the end of each fiscal year. No such prepayment was required with respect to fiscal year 2015. We may voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the Secured Credit Facilities in whole or in part upon prior notice without premium or penalty, other than certain fees incurred in connection with a repricing transaction. 
    
  As of   September 6, 2016  , Operations was in compliance with all covenant restrictions under the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities. The following tables present the Total Leverage Ratio and the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio on a rolling four quarter basis through   September 6, 2016  :

    2015 Senior Notes   On   December 15, 2015  , Operations issued   $350.0 million   of 2015 Senior Notes, maturing   December 15, 2023  . Interest on the 2015 Senior Notes accrues at the rate of   8.25%   per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15.  
    
  The 2015 Senior Notes are guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by each Guarantor (other than Operations  Parent) that guarantees our obligations under the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities. As of   September 6, 2016  , Operations and the Guarantors accounted for approximately   93%   of Holdings  combined total assets, excluding intercompany items, and accounted for approximately   92%   of outstanding total liabilities, including trade payables, all of which are structurally senior to the 2015 Senior Notes. For the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  , Operations and the Guarantors accounted for approximately   93%   of Holdings  revenues and approximately   91%   of Holdings  operating income, excluding selling, general and administrative expenses.  
    
  Other Debt   On   August 9, 2016  , we entered into the Wells Fargo Mortgage Loan with a maturity date of   May 31, 2019  . The note has a principal amount of   $37.0 million   and accrues interest at a variable interest rate calculated as   2.90%   plus the greater of (i) one month LIBOR or (ii)   0.25%  . The proceeds of the Wells Fargo Mortgage Loan were primarily used to repay outstanding balances on the Stonebriar / Monarch Loan and the existing mortgage loan agreements with Atlantic Capital Bank and BancFirst.  
  
   53 

As of   September 6, 2016  , other debt and capital leases totaled   $102.2 million  , including   $11.8 million   of notes payable related to certain Non-Core Development Entities and   $51.6 million   in capital leases. 
  The following table summarizes the components of our interest expense for the   twelve and thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  : 

_______________________ 
    
           (1) 
    Interest expense related to funded debt includes interest on the facilities and borrowings under the Secured Credit Facilities, the 2015 Senior Notes, the Wells Fargo Mortgage Loan, the Stonebriar / Monarch Loan and mortgage loans with Atlantic Capital Bank and BancFirst. 
       
           (2)  
    Includes interest expense on capital leases and other indebtedness, offset by capitalized interest. 
       
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
    
  We are not aware of any off-balance sheet arrangements as of   September 6, 2016  . There have been no material changes outside the normal course of business to our contractual obligations or commercial commitments from those previously disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report. 

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Our indebtedness consists of both fixed and variable rate debt facilities. As of   October 7, 2016  , the interest rate on the term loan facility under the Secured Credit Facilities was a variable rate calculated as the higher of (i) a   4.0%    Floor  or (ii) an elected LIBOR plus a margin of   3.0%  . Therefore, the term loan facility is effectively subject to a   4.0%   Floor until LIBOR exceeds   1.0%  . As of   October 7, 2016  , the three month LIBOR was   0.88%  . A hypothetical   0.5%   increase in LIBOR would result in a   $2.6 million   increase in annual interest expense. 
    Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
  Our interests in foreign economies include three golf properties in Mexico and two managed business clubs in China. We translate foreign currency denominated amounts into U.S. dollars and we report our consolidated condensed financial results of operations in U.S. dollars. Because the value of the U.S. dollar fluctuates relative to other currencies, revenues that we generate or expenses that we incur in other currencies could increase or decrease our revenues or expenses as reported in U.S. dollars. Total foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses comprised less than   1.0%   of our consolidated revenues and expenses, respectively, for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016  . 
  Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could also increase or decrease foreign currency transaction gains and losses which are reflected as a component of club operating costs. Total foreign currency transaction losses for the   thirty-six weeks ended     September 6, 2016   totaled less than   $0.1 million  .

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, which are required in accordance with Rule 15d-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). This section includes information concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in the certifications. 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of senior management personnel, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures at the reasonable assurance level (as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of   September 6, 2016  . We perform this evaluation on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures can be reported in our annual and quarterly reports filed under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, and subject to the limitations described below, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of   September 6, 2016  . 
    
  Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 6, 2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
    
  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of a control system reflects resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. 

PART II 

ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  From time to time, we are involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to companies engaged in our line of business, including commercial disputes, disputes with members regarding their membership agreements, employment issues and claims relating to personal injury and property damage. We are not involved in any pending legal proceedings that we believe would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
    
  There have been no material changes to our risk factors that we believe are material to our business, results of operations and financial condition, from the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016, which is accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  
    
  On February 24, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to   $50 million   of our common stock with an expiration date of December 31, 2017. The repurchase program may be executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market or privately negotiated transactions, including through plans designed under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  
    
  The following table contains information about our purchases of equity securities registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act during the twelve weeks ended   September 6, 2016  . 

______________________ 
    
           (1) 
    Represents shares purchased under the share repurchase plan. 
       
  Dividend Policy and Limitations 
       
  In December 2013, our Board of Directors adopted a policy to pay, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the availability of funds, a regular quarterly cash dividend at an indicated annual rate of $0.48 per share of common stock, subject to quarterly declaration. On December 3, 2014, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend, resulting in indicated annual dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock. 
    
  Our ability to pay dividends depends in part on our receipt of cash distributions from our operating subsidiaries, which may be restricted from distributing us cash as a result of the laws of their jurisdiction of organization, agreements of our subsidiaries or covenants under any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. In particular, the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us is limited by covenants in the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the 2015 Senior Notes. The payment of such quarterly dividends and any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.
