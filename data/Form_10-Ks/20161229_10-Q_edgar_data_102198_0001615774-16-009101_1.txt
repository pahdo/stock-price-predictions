  CALMARE THERAPEUTICS INCORPORATED AND
SUBSIDIARY  

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Interim
Financial Statements 

 (Unaudited) 

1.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

The interim condensed
consolidated financial information presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes hereto is
unaudited. 

Calmare Therapeutics
Incorporated and its majority-owned (56.1%) subsidiary, Vector Vision, Inc., (collectively, the  Company,   we, 
 our,  or  us ), is a medical device company developing and commercializing innovative products and technologies
for chronic neuropathic pain and wound care affliction patients. The Company s flagship medical device, the Calmare   
Pain Therapy Device (the  Calmare Device ), is the world s only non-invasive and non-addictive modality that
can successfully treat chronic, neuropathic pain. 

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiary, Vector Vision, Inc. Inter-company accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

We believe we have
made all adjustments necessary, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, to present the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The results for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the full year ending December
31, 2016. 

The interim unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on April 14, 2016. 

During the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a significant concentration of revenues from the Calmare    Device. The
percentages of gross revenue attributed to sales and rentals of Calmare Devices, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015, were 94% and 95%, respectively. The percentages of gross revenue attributed to sales and rentals of Calmare
Devices, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, were 93% and 94%, respectively. Additionally, the
percentage of gross revenue attributed to other Calmare Device related sales of equipment and training, in the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, were 5% and 4%, respectively. The percentage of gross revenue attributed to other Calmare
Device related sales of equipment and training, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, were 5% and
4%, respectively. We continue to attempt to expand our sales activities for the Calmare Device and expect the majority of our revenues
to come from this technology. 

The Company has incurred
operating losses since fiscal 2006 and has a working capital deficiency and shareholders  deficiency at September 30, 2016.
The Company has taken steps to reduce its operating expenses as well as increase revenue from sales of Calmare Devices and related
sales. However, even at the reduced spending levels, should the anticipated increase in revenue from sales of Calmare Devices and
related sales not occur the Company may not have sufficient cash flow to fund operations through 2016 and into 2017. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include
adjustments to reflect the possible future effect of the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classifications
of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The Company's continuation
as a going concern is dependent upon its developing recurring revenue streams sufficient to cover operating costs. The Company
does not have any significant individual cash or capital requirements in the budget going forward. If necessary, the Company will
attempt to meet anticipated operating cash requirements by further reducing costs, issuing debt and/or equity, and/or pursuing
sales of certain assets and technologies while we pursue licensing and distribution opportunities for our remaining legacy portfolio
of technologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in such efforts. Failure to develop a recurring
revenue stream sufficient to cover operating expenses could negatively affect the Company s financial position. 

Our liquidity requirements
arise principally from our working capital needs, including funds needed to sell our current technologies and obtain new technologies
or products, and protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, if necessary. We fund our liquidity requirements with a
combination of cash on hand, debt and equity financing, sales of common stock and cash flows from operations, if any, including
royalty legal awards. At September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding debt in the form of promissory notes with a total principal
amount of $6,059,000 and a carrying value of $5,908,000. 

2.    NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE  

The following sets
forth the denominator used in the calculations of basic net loss per share and net loss per share assuming dilution: 

Due to the net loss incurred for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, the denominator used in the calculation of basic net loss per
share was the same as that used for net loss per share, assuming dilution, since the effect of any options, convertible preferred
shares, convertible debt or warrants would have been anti-dilutive. 

Potentially dilutive securities outstanding are summarized as
follows: 

3.    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In May 2014, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , as amended
by ASU 2015-14, that outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue recognition and supersedes
most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The amendments in this accounting standard update
are intended to provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improve comparability of revenue recognition practices,
and improve disclosure requirements. The amendments in this accounting standard update are effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted after December 31, 2016. The Company is currently assessing
the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern,  which provides guidance on management s
responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern
and the related footnote disclosure.  For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are
conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year
from the date the financials are issued.  When management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about
the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, the ASU also outlines disclosures that are required in the company s
footnotes based on whether or not there are any plans intended to mitigate the relevant conditions or events to alleviate the substantial
doubt.  The ASU becomes effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for any annual and interim periods
thereafter.  Early application is permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have
on its consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which requires that inventory be measured
at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Prior to the issuance of the new guidance, inventory was measured at the lower of
cost or market. Replacing the concept of market with the single measurement of net realizable value is intended to create efficiencies
for preparers. Inventory measured using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and the retail inventory method are not impacted by
the new guidance. The ASU becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods with
those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements. 

In February 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases , to increase the transparency and comparability about leases among entities. The new
guidance requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a corresponding lease asset for virtually all lease contracts. It
also requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2018, and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ,
which is intended to simplify certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payments to employees. The guidance in this standard
requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled rather than
recording excess tax benefits or deficiencies in additional paid-in capital. The guidance in this standard also allows an employer
to repurchase more of an employee s shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting
and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The standard becomes effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In May 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customer (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients .
The amendments in ASU 2016-12 address narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectability, noncash consideration, and completed
contracts at transition. Additionally, the amendments in this update provide a practical expedient for contract modifications at
transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from
customers. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods
therein. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures. 

4.    RECEIVABLES  

Receivables consist
of the following: 

5.    AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND EQUITY SECURITIES  

The fair value of the
equity securities we held were categorized as available-for-sale securities, which were carried at a fair value of zero, consisted
of shares in Security Innovation and Xion Pharmaceutical Corporation ( Xion ). The Company owns 223,317 shares of stock
in the privately held Security Innovation, an independent provider of secure software located in Wilmington, MA. 

In September 2009 we
announced the formation of a joint venture with Xion for the commercialization of our patented melanocortin analogues for treating
sexual dysfunction and obesity. The Company received 60 shares of privately held Xion Pharmaceutical Corporation common stock in
June 2010. The Company currently owns 30% of the outstanding stock of Xion Pharmaceutical Corporation. 

6.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMEMENTS  

The Company measures
fair value in accordance with Topic 820 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ), Fair Value Measurement
( ASC 820 ), which provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value
hierarchy under ASC 820 are described as follows: 

Level 1 -  
      Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.   

Level 2 -  
      Inputs to the valuation methodology include:   

Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;   

Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;   

Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;   

Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
        observable market data by correlation or other means. 

If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.   

Level 3 -  
      Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement   

The asset's or liability's
fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the
fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs. 

The Company values
its derivative liability associated with the variable conversion feature on its Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (Note 12)
based on the market price of its common stock. For each reporting period the Company calculates the amount of potential common
stock that the Series C Preferred Stock could convert into based on the conversion formula (incorporating market value of our common
stock) and multiplies those converted shares by the market price of its common stock on that reporting date. The total converted
value is subtracted by the consideration paid to determine the fair value of the derivative liability. The Company classified the
derivative liability of approximately $84,000 and $66,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, in Level 2
of the fair value hierarchy. 

The methods described
above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation method is appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the
use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value could result in a different fair value measurement at
the reporting date. 

The carrying amounts
reported in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash, accounts receivable, liabilities under the claims purchase agreement,
accounts payable, GEOMC, notes payable, deferred revenue, and preferred stock liability approximate fair value due to the short-term
maturity of those financial instruments. 

7.    PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS  

Prepaid expenses and
other current assets consist of the following: 

8.    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  

Property and equipment,
net, consist of the following: 

Depreciation and amortization expense was
$4,132 and $12,395, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $3,904 and $12,267, respectively,
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

9.    ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES  

Accrued expenses and
other liabilities consist of the following: 

Excluded above is approximately
$217,000 of accrued expenses and other liabilities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, that fall under the Liability Purchase
Agreement ( LPA ) with ASC Recap, LLC ( ASC Recap ), and are expected to be repaid using the process as
described in Note 10.  Because there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in completing this process,
the Company retains ultimate responsibility for these liabilities, until fully paid down. 

10.    LIABILITIES ASSIGNED TO LIABILITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT  

During the third quarter
of 2013, the Company negotiated a LPA with Southridge, Partners II, L.P. ( Southridge ). The LPA takes advantage of
a provision in the Securities Act of 1933, Section 3(a)(10), that allows the exchange of claims, securities, or property for stock
when the arrangement is approved for fairness by a court proceeding. The process, approved by the court in August 2013, has the
potential to eliminate nearly $2.1 million of the Company s financial obligations to existing creditors who agreed to participate
and executed claims purchase agreements with Southridge s affiliate ASC Recap accounting for $2,093,303 of existing payables,
accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and notes payable. The process began with the issuance in September 2013 of 1,618,235
shares of the Company s common stock to ASC Recap. During September and October 2013, ASC Recap sold the Company s
common stock and during the three months ended March 31, 2014 paid creditors approximately $80,000 from the proceeds and retained
a service fee of approximately $27,000. During 2014, the Company also made cash payments of $18,000 for accrued expenses previously
included in the LPA amount. As of December 29, 2016, no further shares of the Company s common stock had been issued to ASC
Recap to settle creditors  balances. 

There can be no assurance
that the Company will be successful in completing this process with Southridge, and the Company retains ultimate responsibility
for this debt, until fully paid. 

Notes payable consist of the following: 

Details of notes payable as of September
30, 2016 are as follows: 

90 day Convertible Notes   

 The Company has issued
90-day notes payable to borrow funds from a director, now the chairman of our Board, as follows: 

These notes have been
extended several times and all bear 6.00% simple interest. As of September 30, 2016, there is unpaid interest of $546,021 related
to these notes. A conversion feature was added to the notes when they were extended, which allows for conversion of the eligible
principal amounts to common stock at any time after the six month anniversary of the effective date   the date the funds
are received   at a rate of $1.05 per share. Additional terms have been added to all notes to include additional interest
of 1% simple interest per month on all amounts outstanding for all notes if extended beyond their original maturity dates and to
provide the lender with a security interest in unencumbered inventory and intangible assets of the Company other than proceeds
relating to the Calmare Device and accounts receivable. 

Due to the Board s
February 10, 2014 decision authorizing management to nullify certain actions taken by prior management, the additional terms noted
above were not approved and therefore, the additional interest for the extension of the notes was not recorded. During 2014, management
has been in negotiations to modify the terms of the notes. However, until those negotiations are resolved, the Company has agreed
to honor the additional terms and as such, the Company recorded additional interest of approximately $108,000 and $99,000 during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, and has recorded approximately $315,000 and $287,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, As of September 30, 2016, the Company has
recorded total additional interest of approximately $1,321,000. 

A total of $485,980
of the aforementioned notes issued between December 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013 fall under the LPA with ASC Recap, and are expected
to be repaid using the process as described in Note 10.  Because there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful
in completing this process, the Company retains ultimate responsibility for this debt, until fully paid down.  As a result,
the Company continues to accrue interest on these notes and they remain convertible as described above. 

24 month Convertible Notes   

 In March 2012, the
Company issued a 24-month convertible promissory note to borrow $100,000. Additional 24-month convertible promissory notes were
issued in April 2012 ($25,000) and in June 2012 ($100,000). All of the notes bear 6.00% simple interest. Conversion of the eligible
principal amounts to common stock is allowed at any time at a rate of $1.05 per share. 

As of September 30,
2016, the Company has not repaid the principal due on the March 2012 $100,000 note, the April 2012 $25,000 note or the June 2012
$100,000 note and is in default under the terms of the notes. The Company recorded additional interest of approximately $3,400
during both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, and has recorded approximately $10,100 during both
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has recorded total additional
interest of approximately $50,000 related to these notes. 

Series A-3 Original
Issue Discount Convertible Notes and Warrants   

 During the quarter
ended March 31, 2014, the Company did a private offering of a third tranche of convertible notes and warrants, under which it issued
$64,706 of convertible promissory notes for consideration of $55,000, the difference between the proceeds from the notes and principal
amount consists of $9,706 of original issue discount. The notes are convertible at an initial conversion price of $0.25 per share
any time after issuance thereby having an embedded beneficial conversion feature. 

The note holders were
also issued market-related warrants for 129,412 in shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.60 and a term
of 2 years. The beneficial conversion feature, if any, and the warrants were recorded to additional paid-in-capital. The Company
allocated the proceeds received to the notes, the beneficial conversion feature and the warrants on a relative fair value basis
at the time of issuance. The total debt discount is amortized over the life of the notes to interest expense. 

The beneficial conversion
feature was valued at the intrinsic value on the issuance date. The intrinsic value represents the difference between the conversion
price and the fair value of the common stock multiplied by the number of share into which the note is convertible. We estimated
the fair value of the warrants on the issue date using a Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: 

The proceeds of the
Notes issued during the three months ended March 31, 2014 were allocated to the components as follows: 

During the quarter
ended June 30, 2014, certain holders of Series A-3 OID convertible notes and warrants delivered to the Company a notice of conversion
related to the Series A-3 OID convertible notes. Due to the timing of receipt of the notices by the Company, certain Note holders
( Noteholders ) received their shares during the quarter ended June 30, 2014, while other Noteholders received or are
due to receive their shares after June 30, 2014. Additionally, the Company offered certain Noteholders an inducement to convert
their notes to shares. The inducement, when offered, provided Noteholders a conversion price of $0.20. All other original terms,
including the warrant terms, remained the same. Upon notice of conversion and irrespective of whether the shares were delivered
in the quarter ended June 30, 2014 or subsequent to June 30, 2014 to the Company: (i) accelerated and recognized as interest expense
in the current period any remaining discount, and (ii) recognized a loss for the fair value of the additional shares offered as
the conversion inducement.

Series B-1 Original Issue Discount
Convertible Notes and Warrants   

 During the quarter
ended March 31, 2014, the Company did a private offering of convertible notes and warrants, under which it issued $80,000 of convertible
promissory notes for consideration of $65,000, the difference between the proceeds from the notes and principal amount consists
of $15,000 of original issue discount. The notes are convertible at an initial conversion price of $0.35 per share any time after
issuance thereby having an embedded beneficial conversion feature. The note holders were also issued market-related warrants for
185,714 in shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.45 and a 4-year term. The beneficial conversion feature
and the warrants were recorded to additional paid-in-capital. The Company allocated the proceeds received to the notes, the beneficial
conversion feature and the warrants on a relative fair value basis at the time of issuance. The total debt discount is amortized
over the life of the notes to interest expense. 

The beneficial conversion
feature was valued at the intrinsic value on the issuance date. The intrinsic value represents the difference between the conversion
price and the fair value of the common stock multiplied by the number of share into which the note is convertible. We estimated
the fair value of the warrants on the issue date using a Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: 

The proceeds of the
Notes were allocated to the components as follows: 

The Series B-1 OID
notes include an anti-dilution provision that if the Company issues more than 20 million shares of its common stock, subject to
certain exceptions, the conversion price of the notes and the conversion price of the warrants would be subject to an automatic
pre-determined price adjustment. During the quarter ended December 31, 2014 the Series B-1 OID noteholder and the Company agreed
that this anti-dilution provision had been triggered and the Series B-1 OID note share conversion price was adjusted down to $0.23
per share, which increased the number of shares available upon conversion to 347,826. The anti-dilution provision in the Warrant
changed the share purchase price downward to $0.33 per share but did not change the number of shares available under the Warrant. 

As a result of the triggering of the above
noted one time anti-dilution provision, the Company reallocated the proceeds of the Notes during the quarter ended December 31,
2014 as follows:

Stock Option Plan   

On May 2, 2011 the
Company adopted and executed the Employees  Directors  and Consultants Stock Option Plan (the  Plan ).
During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company granted 50,000 options to non-employee directors which were fully vested
upon issuance. 

We estimated the fair
value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: 

(1)  
      We have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since 1981, and currently do not have plans to pay or declare cash dividends. Consequently, we used an expected dividend rate of zero for the valuations.   

(2)  
      Estimated based on our historical experience. Volatility was based on historical experience over a period equivalent to the expected life in years.   

(3)  
      Based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate with a term consistent with the expected life of the options granted.   

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, 440,000 options were cancelled and 46,000 options expired. 

During both the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no stock options issued to directors. During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company recognized expense of $7,180 and $8,260, respectively, for stock options issued to employees and
consultants. The Company realized a credit of $13,280 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 for options cancelled as
a result of the January 2016 resignation of the Company s Chief Financial Officer. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized expense of $7,963 for stock options issued to directors and recognized expense
of $25,006 and $41,218, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, for stock options issued to employees. 

Preferred Stock   

Holders of 5% preferred
stock are entitled to receive, if, as, and when declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefore, preferential
non-cumulative dividends at the rate of $1.25 per share per annum, payable quarterly, before any dividends may be declared or paid
upon or other distribution made in respect of any share of common stock. The 5% preferred stock is redeemable, in whole at any
time or in part from time to time, on 30 days' notice, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price of $25. In the event
of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, the holders of preferred stock are entitled to $25 per share in cash before any distribution
of assets can be made to holders of common stock. 

Each share of 5% preferred
stock is entitled to one vote. Holders of 5% preferred stock have no preemptive or conversion rights. The preferred stock is not
registered to be publicly traded. 

The rights of the Series
C Convertible Preferred Stock are as follows: 

a)  
       Dividend rights    The shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock accrue a 5% cumulative dividend on a quarterly basis and is payable on the last day of each fiscal quarter when declared by the Company s Board. As of September 30, 2016, dividends declared were $117,274, of which $4,726 and $14,075 were declared during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and are recorded as interest expense. $98,528 of the total dividends declared have not been paid and are shown in accrued and other liabilities at September 30, 2016.   

b)  
       Voting rights    Holders of these shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock shall have voting rights equivalent to 1,000 votes per $1,000 par value Series C Convertible Preferred share voted together with the shares of Common Stock   

c)  
       Liquidation rights    Upon any liquidation these Series C Convertible Preferred Stock shares shall be treated as equivalent to shares of Common stock to which they are convertible.   

d)  
       Conversion rights    Holder has right to convert each share of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock at any time into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price for each share of common stock equal to 85% of the lower of (a) the closing market price at the date of notice of conversion or (b) the mid-point of the last bid price and the last ask price on the date of the notice of conversion. The variable conversion feature creates an embedded derivative that was bifurcated from the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock on the date of issuance and was recorded at fair value. The derivative liability will be recorded at fair value on each reporting date with any change recorded in the Statement of Operations as an unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instrument.   

The Company recorded
a convertible preferred stock derivative liability associated with the 375 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding
of $83,591 and $66,177 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

The Company has classified
the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock as a liability at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 because the variable conversion
feature may require the Company to settle the conversion in a variable number of its common shares. 

Common Stock   

 At its December 2,
2010 meeting, the CTI Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right (each, a  Right ) for each outstanding

record as of the close of business on December 2, 2010 (the  Record Date ). Issuance of the dividend may be triggered
by an investor purchasing more than 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock.

The Company s
Distribution Rights, Marineo and Delta  

On April 8, 2014, Mr.
Giuseppe Marineo, Delta Research and Development ( Delta ), Mr. Marineo s research company, and Delta International
Services and Logistics ( DIS L ), Delta s commercial arm in which Mr. Marineo is the sole beneficiary of
all proceeds as its founder and sole owner (collectively the  Group ), issued a press release (the  Group s
Press Release ) regarding the Company, stating that the Company did not have authority to sell, distribute and manufacture
the Calmare Device as an exclusive agent of the Group. The Company issued a corporate response in a press release dated April 11,
2014 stating that the Group s Press Release was inaccurate and has since been purged by the overseeing body of wire services. 

This issue between
the Company and the Group is over the validity of a 2012 Amendment to a Sales and Representation Agreement (the  Amendment )
which, if valid and enforceable, may have compromised its rights to sell, distribute and manufacture the Calmare Device as an exclusive
agent of the Group in the global marketplace, especially in the European, Middle Eastern and North African ( EMENA )
territory which was responsible for approximately 70% of gross Calmare Device sales in 2011. However, the Company believes that
the Amendment is neither valid nor enforceable as it was never duly signed or authorized and subsequently deemed null and void.
Therefore, the parties  rights are determined by an earlier agreement whereby the Company still possesses the authority to
sell, distribute and manufacture Calmare Devices as a world-wide exclusive agent of the Group. 

On April 16, 2014,
counsel for the Group ( Group Counsel ) sent a cease and desist letter ( Cease and Desist Letter ) to the
Company, requesting a confirmation that the Company would no longer hold itself out as an agent of the Group permitted to sell,
distribute and manufacture Calmare Devices world-wide including the EMENA territory. 

The Company responded
on April 25, 2014 to the Cease and Desist Letter, disputing Group Counsel s interpretation of the events surrounding the
execution of the Amendment. At that time, the Company initiated an effort to find a reasonable and amicable resolution to the situation. To
date, despite a number of attempts by the Company, the situation remains unresolved. The Company continues to properly sell and
distribute Calmare Devices manufactured under the 2007 Agreement and the 2011 Amendment. 

14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

Our Board of Directors
determined that when a director's services are outside the normal duties of a director, we compensate the director at the rate
of $1,000 per day, plus expenses, which is the same amount we pay a director for attending a one-day Board meeting.  We
classify these amounts as consulting expenses, included in personnel and consulting expenses. 

As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has $380,400 and $308,400, respectively, owed in fees to current directors, which are in
Accounts Payable. 

As of September 30,
2016, $2,598,980 of the outstanding Notes payable were Notes payable to related parties; $2,498,980 to the Chairman of the Board
and $100,000 to another director. As of September 30, 2016, unpaid interest related to these notes amounted to approximately $1,867,000
to the Chairman of the Board and $26,000 to another director, which is recorded in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities. 

Dr. Stephen J. D Amato,
the Company s chief medical officer is also one of the managing members of Calmar Pain Relief, LLC. Calmar Pain Relief purchases
from the Company electrodes for use with the Calmare Device. These electrodes are purchased at the same price as those purchased
by other customers. In the first nine months of 2016, purchases of electrodes by Calmar Pain Relief totaled $2,500. 

Since October 15, 2015,
the Company has a consulting agreement with VADM Robert T. Conway, Jr., U.S. Navy, (Ret) (the  Admiral ), a member
of the Company s Board of Directors. The agreement is for one year and includes compensation of a monthly retainer fee of
$7,500 and a five year warrant to purchase 167,000 shares of common stock of the Company, fully vested on the date of issuance,
at a strike price of $.60 per share with an aggregate estimated fair value of $33,734. As a result of this agreement, the Board
of Directors has determined that the Admiral is no longer an independent director of the Company. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company has $22,500 in consulting fees payable to the Admiral. 

There are no subsequent
events to report.

Overview  

Calmare Therapeutics
Incorporated (the  Company ) was incorporated in Delaware in 1971 as Competitive Technologies, Inc., succeeding an
Illinois corporation incorporated in 1968. Effective August 20, 2014, the Company changed its name from Competitive Technologies,
Inc. to Calmare Therapeutics Incorporated. The Company and its majority-owned subsidiary, Vector Vision, Inc., (collectively,  we, 
 our,  or  us ), is a medical device company developing and commercializing innovative products and technologies
for chronic neuropathic pain and wound care affliction patients. The Company s flagship medical device, the Calmare   
Pain Therapy Device (the  Calmare Device ), is the world s only non-invasive and non-addictive modality that
can successfully treat chronic, neuropathic pain. 

In 2007, the Company
entered into an agreement (the  2007 Agreement ) with Giuseppe Marineo ( Marineo ) and Delta Research and
Development ( Delta ), Mr. Marineo s wholly-owned company, collectively (the  Parties ), that secured
the exclusive, worldwide sales and distribution rights to the science behind Calmare Pain Mitigation Therapy  (the  Technology ).
Today, this science is effectuated by the Company s flagship medical device   the Calmare Device. Sales of our Calmare
Device continue to be the major source of revenue for the Company. In 2011, the Company s 2007 agreement was amended (the
 2011 Amendment ) to extend the exclusivity rights afforded to the Company by the 2007 Agreement through March 31,
2016. The Company continues to properly sell and distribute Calmare Devices manufactured under the 2007 Agreement and the 2011
Amendment. 

In July 2012, the Company
and the Parties worked on a five-year extension to the 2011 Agreement (the  2012 Amendment ). However, the Company
believes that the 2012 Amendment is neither valid nor enforceable as it was never duly signed or authorized and subsequently deemed
null and void. Therefore, the Company s rights are determined by the 2011 Amendment which provides the Company with the exclusive
rights to manufacture and sell the Calmare Device worldwide using the Technology. The Company is negotiating an extension to the
2007 Agreement. The Company continues to properly sell and distribute Calmare Devices manufactured under the 2007 Agreement and
the 2011 Amendment. (see  the Company s Distribution Rights, Marineo and Delta  in Footnote 13.   CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
AND CONTINGENCIES and below) 

In 2010, the Company
became its own distributor for the Calmare Device in the U.S, contracting with 15 commissioned sales representatives. During 2011
and 2012, the Company and its representatives developed plans to increase awareness of the Calmare Device among critical medical
specialties and began to implement those plans targeting specific customers and locations in 2012. Since then the Company has entered
into multiple sales agreements for the Calmare Device. Sales to physicians and medical practices and to others with whom the Company
had existing sales agreements continue to generate revenue for the Company. In June 15, 2010, the Company became a government contractor
and was granted its first General Services Administration ( GSA ) contract (V797P-4300B) from the U.S. Veterans Administration
(the  VA ) for Calmare Devices. 

Since 2010 the Company
has controlled the sales process for its Calmare    Device. We are the primary obligor, responsible for delivering
devices as well as training our customer in the proper use of the Calmare Device. We deal directly with customers, setting pricing
and providing training; work directly with the inventor of the technology to develop specifications and any changes thereto and
to select and contract with manufacturing partners; and retain significant credit risk for amounts billed to customers. Therefore,
all product sales are recorded following a gross revenue methodology. 

We record in product
sales the total funds earned from customers and record the costs of the Calmare device as cost of product sales, with gross profit
from product sales     being the result.  The Technology supporting the Calmare
Device has patent protection in Italy and the United States. Additional applications for patents have been filed internationally
and are pending approval. The Calmare Device has CE Mark certification from the European Union as well as U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance.  

The Company s
Distribution Rights, Marineo and Delta  

On April 8, 2014, Mr.
Giuseppe Marineo and Delta Research and Development ( Delta ), Mr. Marineo s research company, and Delta International
Services and Logistics ( DIS L ), Delta s commercial arm in which Mr. Marineo is the sole beneficiary of
all proceeds as its founder and sole owner (collectively the  Group ), issued a press release (the  Group s
Press Release ) regarding the Company, stating that the Company did not have authority to sell, distribute and manufacture
the Calmare Device as an exclusive agent of the Group. The Company issued a corporate response in a press release dated April 11,
2014 stating that the Group s Press Release was inaccurate and has since been purged by the overseeing body of wire services. 

This issue between
the Company and the Group is over the validity of a 2012 Amendment to a Sales and Representation Agreement (the  Amendment )
which, if valid and enforceable, may have compromised its rights to sell, distribute and manufacture the Calmare Device as an exclusive
agent of the Group in the global marketplace, especially in the European, Middle Eastern and North African ( EMENA )

Presentation  

All amounts in this
Item 2 are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars. 

The following discussion
and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and
results of operations. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and
Notes thereto. 

Results of Operations   Three months ended September
30, 2016 vs. three months ended September 30, 2015  

Summary of Results  

Our net loss, for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, decreased to $648,000 or $0.02 per basic and diluted share as compared with a net loss of $1,063,000
or $0.04 per basic and diluted share in the three months ended September 30, 2015. This net loss decrease is primarily attributable
to an increase in revenue and a decrease in operating expenses offset by an increase in interest expense. 

Revenue and Gross
Profit from Sales  

Revenue from the
sale and shipment of Calmare Devices  in the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased $268,000 to $465,000 as compared
with $197,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Cost of product
sales,  in the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased $66,000 to $126,000 as compared with $60,000 in the three months
ended September 30, 2015. This increase in cost of product sales is attributable to the increase in Devices sold in the three months
ended September 30, 2015 as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Calmare Device sales,
 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were comprised of five (5) and two (2) U.S. private sector
sales, respectively. 

Due to the relatively
long sales cycle for a Calmare Device, Calmare Device sales and related revenues and expenses can and will vary significantly from
quarter to quarter. 

Other Revenue  

Retained royalties,
in the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased $3,000 to $5,000 compared to $2,000 in the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase is primarily the result of the timing of certain royalties that occurred in the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Other income, for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, increased $17,000 to $31,000 as compared with $14,000 in the three months ended September
30, 2015. Other income includes: 

Expenses  

Total expenses  decreased
$193,000 or 16% to $1,023,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with $1,216,000 in the three months ended
September 30, 2015. 

Total operating
expenses  decreased $250,000 or 28% to $635,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with $885,000 in the
three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Selling expenses
 decreased 66% or $45,000 to $23,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with $68,000 in the three months
ended September 30, 2015. This increase is the result of lower overall commissions paid on the sales of the Devices in the third
quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to the sales of four Devices in the third quarter of 2016
without commission. 

Personnel and consulting
expenses,  in the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased 2% or $11,000 to $444,000 as compared with $455,000 in the
three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to slight decreases in both personnel and consulting
expenses. 

General and administrative
expenses , in the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased 54% or $194,000 to $168,000 as compared with $362,000 in
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of $103,000 in corporate legal expense
costs related to ongoing litigation. Other general and administrative expenses including directors  fees, travel and investor
fees also decreased. 

Interest expense,
 in the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased $94,000 or 31% to $394,000 as compared with $300,000 in the three months
ended September 30, 2015 primarily as a result of the additional OID borrowings in 2015 and 2016. 

Unrealized (gain)
loss on derivative instruments,  in the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased $36,000 or 116% to ($5,000) as compared
with $31,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2015. This reflects the impact of the Company s common stock price on
the Class C Preferred Stock at the end of each period. 

Results of Operations   Nine months ended September
30, 2016 vs. nine months ended September 30, 2015  

Summary of Results  

Our net loss, for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased to $2,638,000 or $0.09 per basic and diluted share as compared with a net loss
of $2,846,000 or $0.10 per basic and diluted share in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This net loss decrease is primarily
attributable to an increase in revenue and a decrease in operating expenses partially offset by an increase in interest expense. 

Revenue and Gross
Profit from Sales  

Revenue from the
sale and shipment of Calmare Devices  in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased $311,000 to $716,000 as compared
with $405,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Cost of product
sales,  in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased $92,000 to $200,000 as compared with $108,000 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. This increase in cost of product sales is attributable to the increase in sales. 

Calmare Device sales,
 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were eight (8) Calmare Devices, one to the U.S. military and seven to the U. S.
Private sector as compared with four (4) Devices to the U.S. private sector for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Due to the relatively
long sales cycle for a Calmare Device, Calmare Device sales and related revenues and expenses can and will vary significantly from
quarter to quarter. 

Other Revenue  

Retained royalties,
in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased $7,000 to $14,000 compared to $7,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase is primarily the result of the timing of certain royalties that occurred in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Other income, for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased $16,000 to $55,000 as compared with $39,000 in the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Other income includes: 

Expenses  

Total expenses  increased
$35,000 or 1% to $3,224,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with $3,189,000 in the nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

Total operating
expenses  decreased $404,000 or 16% to $2,050,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with $2,454,000 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Selling expenses
 decreased 23% or $26,000 to $86,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with $112,000 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily due to the sales of four Devices in the third quarter of 2016 without commission. 

Personnel and consulting
expenses,  in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased 1% or $19,000 to $1,310,000 as compared with $1,329,000 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This slight decrease is attributable to a $143,000 decrease in consulting costs offset
by a $123,000 increase in personnel expenses as a result of recent hires. 

General and administrative
expenses , in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased 35% or $358,000 to $654,000 as compared with $1,012,000 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of $263,000 in corporate legal expense
costs related to ongoing litigation. Other general and administrative expenses including directors  fees, travel and investor
fees also decreased. 

Interest expense,
 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased $466,000 or 67% to $1,157,000 as compared with $691,000 in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 primarily as a result of the additional OID borrowings in 2015 and 2016. 

Unrealized loss
on derivative instruments,  in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased $25,000 or 60% to $17,000 as compared with
$42,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This reflects the impact of the Company s common stock price on the
Class C Preferred Stock at the end of each period. 

Loss on conversion
of notes  was $2,600 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. There was no loss on conversion of notes in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. 

Financial Condition
and Liquidity  

Our liquidity requirements
arise principally from our working capital needs, including funds needed to sell our current technologies and obtain new technologies
or products, and protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, if necessary. We fund our liquidity requirements with a
combination of cash on hand, debt and equity financing, sales of common stock and cash flows from operations, if any. At September
30, 2016, the Company had outstanding debt in the form of promissory notes with a total principal amount of $6,059,000 and a carrying
value of $5,908,000. 

Our future cash requirements
depend on many factors, including results of our operations and marketing efforts, results and costs of our legal proceedings,
and our equity financing. To achieve and sustain profitability, we are implementing a corporate reengineering effort, which commenced
on September 26, 2013 under the direction of the Company s president   CEO, Mr. Conrad Mir. This plan design will change
the inherent design of the current distributor network and focus on opportunities within the US Departments of Defense (the  DOD )
and Veterans Affairs ( VA ), and set out to upgrade the Company s current U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )
clearance designation for the Calmare Device to approval. Although we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts,
we believe the combination of our cash on hand and revenue from executing our strategic plan will be sufficient to meet our obligations
of current and anticipated operating cash requirements. 

At September 30, 2016,
cash was $7,000, as compared with $50,000 at December 31, 2015. Net cash used in operating activities was ($1,243,000) for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to ($1,136,000) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily reflecting
an increase in debt discount amortization and use of inventory offset by a decrease in net loss, non-cash equity expenses, prepaid
expenses and accounts payable. 

There was no investing
activity year to date in 2016 and minimal activity in 2015. 

Net cash provided by
financing activities was $1,200,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $1,180,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of the Company s debt and equity financing activities in both periods. 

We currently have the
benefit of using a portion of our accumulated net operating losses ( NOLs ) to eliminate any future regular federal
and state income tax liabilities. We will continue to receive this benefit until we have utilized all of our NOLs, federal and
state. However, we cannot determine when and if we will be profitable enough to utilize the benefit of the remaining NOLs before
they expire. 

Going Concern  

The Company has incurred
operating losses since fiscal 2006 and has a working capital deficiency at September 30, 2016. During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had a significant concentration of revenues from sales of our Calmare Devices. We continue
to seek revenue from new and existing technologies or products to mitigate the concentration of revenues, and replace revenues
from expiring licenses on other technologies. 

Although we have taken
steps to significantly reduce operating expenses going forward, even at these reduced spending levels, should the anticipated increase
in revenue from sales of Calmare Devices and other technologies not occur, the Company may not have sufficient cash flow to fund
operations through 2016 and into 2017. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. 

The Company's continuation
as a going concern is dependent upon its developing recurring revenue streams sufficient to cover operating costs. The Company
does not have any significant individual cash or capital requirements in the budget going forward. If necessary, the Company will
meet anticipated operating cash requirements by further reducing costs, issuing debt and /or equity, and / or pursuing sales of
certain assets and technologies while we pursue licensing and distribution opportunities for our remaining portfolio of technologies.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in such efforts. To return to and sustain profitability, we must
increase our revenue through sales of our Calmare Devices and other products and services related to the Devices. Our recent contract
with the U.S. Government over five years will significantly improve our revenue streams. Failure to develop a recurring revenue
stream sufficient to cover operating expenses would negatively affect the Company s financial position. 

Notes Payable  

Details of notes payable as of September
30, 2016 are as follows: 

90 day Convertible
Notes   

 The Company has issued
90-day notes payable to borrow funds from a director, now the chairman of our Board, as follows: 

These notes have been
extended several times and all bear 6.00% simple interest. As of September 30, 2016, there is unpaid interest of $546,021 related
to these notes. A conversion feature was added to the notes when they were extended, which allows for conversion of the eligible
principal amounts to common stock at any time after the six month anniversary of the effective date   the date the funds
are received   at a rate of $1.05 per share.  Additional terms have been added to all notes to include
additional interest 1% simple interest per month on all amounts outstanding for all notes if extended beyond their original maturity
dates and to provide the lender with a security interest in unencumbered inventory and intangible assets of the Company other than
proceeds relating to the Calmare Device and accounts receivable. 

Due to the Board s
February 10, 2014 decision authorizing management to nullify certain actions taken by prior management, the additional terms noted
above were not approved and therefore, the additional interest for the extension of the notes was not recorded.  Since 2014,
management has been in negotiations to modify the terms of the notes. However, until those negotiations are resolved, the Company
has agreed to honor the additional terms and as such, the Company recorded additional interest of approximately $315,000 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and has recorded additional interest in total of $1,321,000. 

A total of $485,980
of the aforementioned notes issued between December 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013 fall under the liabilities purchase agreement with
ASC Recap, and are expected to be repaid using the process as described in Note 10.  Because there can be no assurance
that the Company will be successful in completing this process, the Company retains ultimate responsibility for this debt, until
fully paid down.  As a result, the Company continues to accrue interest on these notes and they remain convertible as
described above. 

24 month Convertible
Notes   

    In March
2012, the Company issued a 24-month convertible promissory note to borrow $100,000. Additional 24-month convertible promissory
notes were issued in April 2012 ($25,000) and in June 2012 ($100,000). All of the notes bear 6.00% simple interest. Conversion
of the eligible principal amounts to common stock is allowed at any time after at a rate of $1.05 per share. 

As of September 30,
2016 the Company has not repaid the principal due on the March 2012 $100,000 note, the April 2012 $25,000 note or the June 2012
$100,000 note and is in default under the terms of the notes. As of September 30, 2016, there is also unpaid interest of approximately
$50,000 related to these notes.

price of the notes and the conversion price of the warrants would be subject to an automatic pre-determined price adjustment. During

of shares available upon conversion to 347,826. The anti-dilution provision in the Warrant changed the share purchase price downward

Capital requirements  

The Company s
business model does not require significant capital expenditures to manufacture and distribute the Calmare Device. For 2016, we
expect our capital expenditures to be less than $100,000. 

Contractual Obligations and Contingencies  

Contingencies   

Our directors, officers,
employees and agents may claim indemnification in certain circumstances.  

Many of our license
and service agreements provide that upfront license fees, license fees and/or royalties we receive are applied against amounts
that our clients or we have incurred for patent application, prosecution, issuance and maintenance costs.  If we incur
such costs, we expense them as incurred, and reduce our expense if we are reimbursed from future fees and/or royalties we receive.  If
the reimbursement belongs to our client, we record no revenue or expense. 

As of September 30,
2016, the Company and its majority-owned subsidiary, VVI, have remaining obligations, contingent upon receipt of certain revenue,
to repay up to $165,788 and $199,334, respectively, in consideration of grant funding received in 1994 and 1995. The Company also
is obligated to pay at the rate of 7.5% of its revenues, if any, from transferring rights to certain inventions supported by the
grant funds. VVI is obligated to pay at rates of 1.5% of its net sales of supported products or 15% of its revenues from licensing
supported products, if any.

Management evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2014. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.

During the period ending
