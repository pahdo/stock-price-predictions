Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:    

The
Company may, from time to time, make written or oral forward-looking
statements, including statements contained in the Company s filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ) and its reports to
stockholders.  Such forward-looking statements are made based on management s
belief as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to,
management pursuant to  safe harbor  provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  The Company s actual results may differ
materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements due
to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, competition from other
real estate companies, the ability of the Company to obtain financing for
projects, and the continuing operations of tenants.  

PART I   

Item 1. Business.   

Security
Land and Development Corporation (the  Company ) was organized and incorporated
in Georgia in 1970.  The Company, including its wholly owned subsidiaries, the
Royal Palms Motel, Inc., SLDC, LLC, SLDC2, LLC and SLDC III, LLC, has developed
two (2) primary business activities, these activities being (1) the acquisition
of undeveloped land for investment purposes and sale at a future date or
development of the land and sale after developed and, (2) the acquisition or
development of income producing properties for investment purposes and income
from leasing activities.  The Company s principal office is in Augusta, Georgia
and principal activities are in Augusta, Georgia, Evans, Georgia, and North
Augusta, South Carolina.  

The
Company s primary development and income producing activities are:  

Retail
     strip center on 14.24 acres on Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia (the
      National Plaza ).  Approximately 56,000 square feet is leased to Publix
     Supermarkets, Inc. ( Publix ) who operates a retail food supermarket.  The
     remaining approximately 13,000 square feet of rental space is available
     for lease to additional tenants.  At September 30, 2016, approximately 10,400
     square feet of this remaining space was leased.    

An
     outparcel of National Plaza that is 0.89 acres and is leased commercially
     under a 20-year ground-lease to an auto-repair service operation.  

Long-term
     ground lease ( Evans Ground Lease ) on approximately 17 acres in
     Evans, Georgia at the intersection of Washington Road and Industrial Park
     Drive to Lowe's, a national home improvement retailer.     

Commercial
     building on Wrightsboro Road in Augusta, Georgia.  Approximately 25,000 square
     feet is currently leased to a retailer.  The building includes an
     additional 27,000 square feet of warehouse space that is for lease as of
     September 30, 2016.   

-2-      

The Company owns certain other properties that are
more fully described in Item 2,  Properties.   

In
January of 2007 construction of the Evans Ground Lease was completed and the
Company began collecting full monthly rent.  The Evans Ground Lease represents approximately
35% of the Company s net leased assets at September 30, 2016.  Rent revenue,
including monthly rent, recognition of previously deferred revenue and property
taxes from the Evans Ground Lease represented 40% and 45% of the Company s
total gross rent revenue for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  The Company also expects the long-term ground lease in Evans,
Georgia to provide a substantial portion of the Company s revenue from leasing
in future years.    

Construction
of the National Plaza was completed in May 1995 and the lease with Publix became
effective May 15, 1995.  National Plaza represents approximately 38% of the
Company s net leased assets at September 30, 2016.  Rent revenue, including
monthly rent, recognition of previously deferred revenue, property taxes and
common area maintenance from the lease with Publix Supermarkets, Inc. represented
35% and 40% of the Company s total gross rent revenue for the years ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Management of the Company expects
this lease to continue to provide a substantial portion of the Company s
revenue from leasing.   See Item 2,  Properties  for additional information
related to these properties and the lease agreements.  

In
September of 2015 the Company purchased a Commercial building on 3.5 acres of
land located on Wrightsboro Road in Augusta, Georgia.  The building is
currently partially leased to a local retailer.  The Wrightsboro Road property
represents approximately 27% of the Company s net leased assets at September
30, 2016.  Rent revenue, including monthly rent, recognition of previously
deferred revenue, property taxes and common area maintenance from this lease represented
9% of the Company s total gross rent revenue for the year ended September 30, 2016. 
No rents related to this lease were due or collected for the year ended
September 30, 2015 as the tenant s rent commenced on October 1, 2015.   

The Company owns additional undeveloped land parcels
in and around the Augusta, Georgia and North Augusta, South Carolina area that are
being held for investment purposes. Management of the Company believes that the
market value of the property owned is greater than its carrying value. The
Company presently has four employees, all of whom are officers and/or stockholders
of the Company.      

   Item 1A. Risk Factors.    

  The Company, as a smaller reporting
company, is not required to provide the information required by this item.   

   Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.    

  None.  

   Item 2. Properties   .   

  The
Company owns developed and undeveloped real estate in several locations in the
State of Georgia and one undeveloped parcel in North Augusta, South Carolina. 
There are no limitations on the percentage of assets which may be invested in
any one property or type of property.  The Company acquires various properties
for investment purposes and for leasing activities.

Description of real estate and operating data:    

The
Company holds approximately 12.54 acres of land in Evans, Georgia on Belair
Road and North Belair Road Extension, at Washington Road.  The land was
purchased in five transactions.  Initially, the Company acquired a two-thirds
interest in 7.09 acres of land, with the remaining one-third interest held by
two individuals, one of which is a principal stockholder and member of the
Board of Directors.  In 2000, the remaining one-third interest in the 7.09
acres of land was acquired from two individuals that each owned a one-sixth
interest.  One of the individuals that owned a one-sixth interest in the
property is a principal stockholder and member of the Board of Directors of the
Company.  The aggregate purchase price of the land was $522,846.  A third
transaction, in 2000, was a purchase of approximately 3.86 acres in Evans,
Georgia adjacent to the purchased property previously described.  The land was
jointly owned by principal stockholders and members of the Board of Directors
of the Company and their families, and was acquired by the Company from these
individuals.  The purchase price of the land was $371,970.  In a fourth
transaction, the Company purchased an additional 1.03 acres for $342,122 on Old
Evans Road in Evans, Georgia that adjoins the above-described properties.  And
in the fifth and final transaction in 2004, the Company acquired a corner
parcel of 0.79 acres adjoining the previously described three parcels from a
member of the Board of Directors.  The cost of the parcel acquired in 2004, was
$467,874.  The Company's net book value of the investment properties acquired
in these five transactions of $1,679,612, including the cost of improvements
thereon, is approximately 14% of the Company s total assets at September 30,
2016.  The Company has a Federal tax basis in the investment property of $1,044,109. 
The Company signed a long-term ground lease for the development of a Lowe s
home improvement store on this property as well as the 4.61 acres, discussed
below, during 2006. The Company began earning revenue related to the long-term
ground lease on the approximately 18 acres in Columbia County, Georgia during
the 3 rd  Quarter of 2006.  The Company received $20,833 in monthly
rent until the January 2007 expiration of the development period.  Following
the expiration of the development period, the lease requires annual rental
payments of $500,000 for the first 5 years then increasing 5% in years 6, 11,
and 16.  The lease has an option to renew at year 21 and another option every 5
years thereafter for a possible total lease term of 50 years.  The lease
provides for the tenant to pay for insurance and property taxes. A note payable
to an insurance company is collateralized with the property and an assignment
of the long-term ground lease.  The note is payable in monthly installments of
$17,896 including interest, through May 1, 2027, and bears interest of a fixed
rate of 5.85%.  The balance of the loan was $1,701,024 at September 30, 2016. 
Property taxes paid on this property and the 4.61 acres described above in 2016
totaled $122,446.    

In
2001, the Company purchased an office building with land totaling approximately
4.61 acres located on Old Evans Road in Evans, Georgia.  The property was
purchased with replacement property funds held by a third party from a
tax-deferred like-kind exchange transaction during 2000 of $511,726 and with
approximately $250,000 of proceeds from a note payable.  The office building
was demolished during 2006.  The Company's net book value in this property is $703,061
at September 30, 2016.  For tax purposes, the Company recognized a loss of
$236,859 on the demolition of the building in 2006.  The Company's Federal tax
basis in the property is approximately $173,198 at September 30, 2016.  There
is no outstanding debt on this property at September 30, 2016.  Prior to the
demolition, the property, excluding land cost, was being depreciated for
financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over 39 years.  The
property adjoins the 12.77 acres of land in Evans, Georgia.  In July 2009, the
Company sold an easement consisting of approximately .52 acres of the total
Evans Ground Lease tract for $300,000.  The Company recognized a gain of
approximately $195,000.  The proceeds were used by the Company to pay down debt
related to an outstanding note payable collateralized by the Evans Ground Lease
and related land and to compensate the Evans Ground Lease tenant per the
related lease agreement.  The Company s management does not feel that the
easement sale had any adverse impact on the existing lease or the Company s
ability to lease the land going forward.  In July 2013, the Company sold approximately
..24 acres of the total Evans Ground Lease tract for $156,000.  The Company
recognized a gain of approximately $108,000.  The proceeds were used by the
Company to pay down debt related to an outstanding note payable collateralized
by the Evans Ground Lease and related land and to compensate the Evans Ground
Lease tenant per the related lease agreement.   

The
Company's net book value of National Plaza, $2,645,448 at September 30, 2016,
amounts to approximately 23% of the Company s total assets at September 30, 2016.  

-4-      

Construction of National
Plaza was completed in May 1995.  National Plaza has 69,000 square feet of
available lease space.  National Plaza was constructed with the intention of
being operated as a retail strip center and is considered suitable and adequate
for such purpose.  The Company has leased 56,000 square feet to Publix, which,
as National Plaza s anchor tenant, operates a retail food supermarket.  The
Company, as lessor, has a twenty-year lease agreement with Publix.  The lease
became effective May 15, 1995.  The lease provides for annual rentals of
$463,200, and for the Company to receive 1.25% of this Publix store s annual gross
sales in excess of approximately $37 million.  For the Company s years ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the supermarket had not achieved this sales
level.  The lease also provides for Publix to reimburse the Company for
property taxes paid on the facility on a pro rata basis of the space occupied
by Publix.  For 2016, the amount billed was $57,307. The original lease term
expired in June of 2015 and the tenant exercised an option for an additional 5
years.  At the lessee s option the lease may be extended in five-year
increments for an additional 15 years on substantially the same lease terms. 
As part of the lease agreement, Publix contributed approximately $493,000 to
the construction of National Plaza.  The Company capitalized this contribution
and recognized the related revenue over the original twenty-year life of the
lease.    

The Company financed
National Plaza with a $4,300,000 loan, with interest that was fixed at 7.875%. 
Annual principal and interest payments totaled $427,596.  This note was paid in
full in March 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has no outstanding
debt on this property, however, it is being used as collateral for other
Company financing as described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note 3- Notes Payable.  The property is located on Washington Road
in Augusta, Georgia.  Washington Road in Augusta is the location of numerous
business establishments, including competing retail strip centers, and is a
corridor for a high volume of traffic, providing potential customers for the
Company s tenants.  The Company s operation of National Plaza is dependent upon
management s ability to maintain an anchor tenant and to maintain a high
occupancy of the 13,000 square feet available for lease to other tenants.  The
Company competes with other retail strip centers in the area to maintain stable
occupancy.  Management of the Company believes that the location and visibility
of National Plaza provides for favorable conditions for maintaining occupancy. 
At September 30, 2016, the Company had leased 80% of the 13,000 square feet not
leased to Publix.  These individual leases have terms averaging five years,
with monthly lease payments including contributions for common area maintenance
( CAM ), real estate taxes and insurance ranging from $1,517 to $6,761. 
Following is selected statistical information regarding National Plaza at
September 30, 2016:  

Occupancy rate   96%   

(Publix is the only tenant to occupy 10% or more of the   

leasable
square feet.)

totaled $88,464 in 2016.  In June of 2015 the Company sold approximately 1 acre
of vacant land previously included as part of National Plaza adjoining Stanley
Drive. The proceeds were utilized as part of a like-kind-exchange to purchase the
commercial building on Wrightsboro Road described below.  

During
2002, the Company purchased a house on Stanley Drive in Augusta, Georgia.  The
property was purchased for $145,847.  The property was sold in June of 2015 and

approximately 25,000 square feet of retail space and 27,000 square feet of
warehouse space on approximately 3.5 acres of land located on Wrightsboro
road.  The retail space is currently leased to a local retailer and rent
commenced on October 1, 2015. The warehouse space was available for lease as of
September 30, 2016.  The property was purchased using proceeds from a like-kind
exchange from sales in June of 2015 of approximately 1 acre of undeveloped land
previously included as part of National Plaza adjoining Stanley Drive and a
residential house located on Stanley Drive.  

No
other property owned by the Company at September 30, 2016, had a book value
amounting to 10% or more of the total assets of the Company.      

All
of the properties owned by the Company are owned in fee simple interest.  

In

Company is greater than its original cost.  The Company believes that the
continued development and decreasing supply of vacant land in the Augusta,
Georgia area has resulted in substantial appreciation in value in many of the
Company s investment properties.  These appreciated investment properties are
available as a source of capital to the Company.  

Critical Accounting Policies:   

Estimates
of Useful Lives of Investment Properties for Purposes of Depreciation    

  Company
management has estimated the useful lives of investment properties, except for
land, that are leased, and Company management utilizes the straight-line method
to compute depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the investment
properties.  Actual depreciation of investment properties will vary from
management s estimates, and the value of investment properties is more directly
impacted by market conditions and the physical condition of the investment
properties.    

Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment    

  Company management evaluates long-lived
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of investment properties may not be recoverable.  In
evaluating recoverability, Company management generally estimates future cash
flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual
disposition.  An impairment loss is recognized when the expected future cash
flows of the asset are less than the carrying amount.  

Estimates
of Income Tax Rates Applicable to Deferred Taxes    

  Company management has deferred income
taxes through a series of tax-deferred like-kind exchange transactions on
certain investment properties and through accelerated depreciation elections on
certain other assets.  Company management has estimated deferred income tax
liabilities of $1,406,668 at September 30, 2016.  Actual income taxes that may
become due when taxable gains are realized on the sale of assets may differ
from management s estimates as a result of changes in tax laws, the tax status
of the Company, or the actual taxable earnings of the Company in the periods
the deferred income taxes become due.  

Results of Operations:   

Rent revenues from leasing
activities is provided by the following properties:  

-7-      

Years Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

National
Plaza consists of approximately 69,000 square feet.  Approximately 56,000
square feet is leased to Publix as the investment property s anchor tenant. 
See Item 2,  Properties  for additional information regarding the lease
agreement with Publix.  The remaining 13,000 square feet is available for lease
to additional tenants.  This additional space was approximately 80% and 70%
leased as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Attempts are being
made to lease vacant space.  Also see Item 2,  Properties  for effective rental
rates and lease expirations related to this property.  Rent revenue from Publix
and National Plaza increased slightly as compared with the prior years due to
leasing an available 1,300 square foot to One Main Financial and temporary rental
of the vacant lots within National Plaza. In May 2006, the Company entered into
a long-term ground lease with Lowes, a national home improvement retailer, with
a portion of total monthly rent due during the construction period, which was
completed in January 2007. See Item 2,  Properties  for additional information
regarding the Evans Ground Lease.  Management expects both of the above two
lease arrangements to continue to provide a substantial portion of the
Company s revenues.  In addition, rental revenues increased in 2016 due to the
addition of the retail lease related to the Wrightsboro Road property purchased
in September 2015.  

Operating
expenses increased by $53,772 (6%) from 2015.  Operating costs of the Company
consists mainly of the costs of managing National Plaza and property taxes
related to the Company s land holding portfolio.  This increase was due
primarily to repairs to the roof at National Plaza.  Company management expects
operating expenses for 2017 to decrease relative to 2016 as the Company
anticipates repairs in 2017 will be less significant than those incurred in
2016.  

Interest
expense decreased by $14,367 (8%) from 2015.  The Company s interest costs
relate to outstanding debt on the Company s land holdings as discussed above in
Item 2,  Properties .  Continued amortization of outstanding debt balances
resulted in decreased interest expense in 2016.  Company management expects
interest expense for 2017 to decline from interest expense for the current
fiscal year as the outstanding debt continues to amortize.  

In
June of 2015, the Company sold approximately 1 acre of undeveloped land
previously included as part of National Plaza adjoining Stanley Drive and a
residential house located on Stanley Drive resulting in a gain on sale of $1,862,235.  

Other
income for 2015 consisted primarily of the reversal of an accrual related to a
tenant s claim brought about in 2011 for reimbursement of certain expenses
charged.  The Company accrued $150,000 related to this claim and the tenant s
related unsettled balance.  The claim was resolved in 2015 and the related
tenant paid the disputed balance in full and there is no further liability
anticipated. The income was recognized as other income.  

Liquidity
and Sources of Capital:   

The
percentage of current assets to current liabilities was 202% at September 30,
2016, and was 160% at September 30, 2015.  Management of the Company
expects future liquidity needs of the Company to be funded from rent revenues, refinancing
and the appreciation in investment properties (which can be sold or mortgaged,
if necessary).  

Current
maturities of notes payable will require the Company to make payments in fiscal
year 2017 totaling $250,418.  The Company projects that it will be able to
fund the payment of its current maturities of notes payable through cash flows
generated from its operations and cash on hand, but there can be no assurance
that this will occur.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company s cash flow from operations is approximately
$395,062 while current maturities of debt are approximately $250,418.  If the
Company experiences cash flow shortages and is unable to generate adequate cash
flows from operations to fund current debt maturities and other obligations,
the Company s management intends to seek additional financing from other
sources but there can be no assurance that this will occur.  In the past, the
Company has been successful in seeking additional financing.  These sources of capital
include selling certain of its fully owned and un-collateralized assets or
borrowing money from certain stockholders.  

In
November of 2016, the Company obtained a $3,000,000 line of credit from a
regional financial institution to finance probable equity transactions.  

Capital Expenditure
Commitments:   

-8-      

The Company currently has no
significant commitments for capital expenditures for the next twelve months.  

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.    

  Market risk is
the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.  Our market
risk arises principally from the risk inherent in the credit quality of our
tenants.  Company management regularly evaluates the individual tenants
considering their financial condition, credit history and current economic
conditions.  

Item 8. Financial Statements    

  The following consolidated
financial statements of Security Land   Development Corporation are
included herein:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM    

To the Board of Directors   

  Security Land and Development
Corporation   

  Augusta, Georgia   

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Security Land and Development Corporation ( the Company ) as of
September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income
and retained earnings and cash flows for the years then ended. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.    

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our
audits include consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Security Land and Development Corporation as of September 30, 2016
and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years
then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     

    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES      

Business
activities    

  Security
Land and Development Corporation ( the Company ) is engaged in the acquisition
of developed and undeveloped real estate to be held for investment purposes or
to be developed and leased as income producing property.  Substantially all
investment properties held and leased by the Company are located within the
State of Georgia, in Richmond and Columbia counties and in North Augusta, South
Carolina.   

Royal
Palms Motel, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Security Land and Development
Corporation, is a holding company for a parcel of land in Richmond County,
Georgia.  During 2004, the Company organized, as its sole member, SLDC, LLC, a
Georgia limited liability company. During 2007, the Company organized, as its
sole member, SLDC2, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company.  During 2008, the
Company organized, as its sole member, SLDC III, LLC, a South Carolina limited
liability company.  SLDC, LLC, SLDC2, LLC, and SLDC III, LLC were organized by
the Company to hold title to certain real estate that the Company plans to
develop.  

During 2016 and 2015,
substantially all operating revenues and operating expenses were related to
real estate leasing.  A substantial portion of rent revenues were earned from
two investment properties, a commercial retail center, consisting of
approximately 69,000 square feet on Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia
( National Plaza ) and the Evans Ground Lease on Washington Road in Evans,
Georgia ( Evans Ground Lease ).   National Plaza provided approximately 51% of
gross rent revenue in 2016 and 55% in 2015.  Approximately 81% of National
Plaza was leased to a regional food supermarket, with annual rents from the
lease totaling $463,200.  National Plaza comprises approximately 38% of the
asset Investment Properties for Lease, net of Accumulated Depreciation.  The
Evans Ground Lease provided approximately 40% and 45% of gross rental revenue
in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  This property, leased to a national home
improvement retailer, earned rents totaling approximately $539,000 in both 2016
and 2015, respectively.  The Evans Ground Lease comprises approximately 35% of
investment properties held for lease, net, by the Company at September 30, 2016. 

In June of 2015 the Company sold
approximately 1 acre of undeveloped land previously included as part of
National Plaza adjoining Stanley Drive and a residential house located on
Stanley Drive resulting in a gain on sale of $1,862,235.   

In September of 2015 the Company
purchased a commercial building on 3.5 acres of land located on Wrightsboro
Road in Augusta, Georgia.  The building is partially leased to a local retailer
with a rental period beginning October 1, 2015.  The Wrightsboro Road property
represents approximately 27% of the Company s net leased assets at September
30, 2016.  The Wrightsboro Road lease provided approximately 9% of gross rental
revenue in 2016.    

Basis
of presentation   

  The
Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Security Land and
Development Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Royal Palms Motel,
Inc., SLDC, LLC, SLDC2, LLC, and SLDC III, LLC (described on a consolidated
basis as the  Company ).  All intercompany transactions and accounts are
eliminated in consolidation.   

Use
of estimates   

  The
consolidated financial statements include estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates.   

Revenue
recognition   

  Rent
revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related
lease agreements.  The Company is reimbursed by tenants for property taxes and
other maintenance fees.  These reimbursements billed totaled $269,373 and $264,156,
which is included in rent revenue, for the years ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.  

(Continued)  

-14-      

NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES,
Continued      

Revenue
recognition, continued   

  Gains,
or losses, realized from sales of real estate are recognized substantially when
title to the property has passed and the risks and benefits of ownership have
been transferred to the buyer.   

Investment
properties   

  Investment
properties are stated at cost.  Depreciation of the investment properties is
computed principally using the straight-line method over the following
estimated useful lives:   

Buildings for lease  

30 - 40 years  

Land improvements on property for lease  

15 years  

Fixtures and furnishings  

5 - 7 years  

Major
renewals or improvements on investment properties are capitalized, while
maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the
assets are charged to expense when incurred.  Upon retirement, sale or other
disposition of investment properties, the cost and accumulated depreciation are
eliminated from the accounts and the gain or loss is included in income in the
period of disposition.   

The
Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. In evaluating recoverability, the Company generally estimates
future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual
disposition.  An impairment loss is recognized when the expected future cash
flows of the asset is less than the carrying amount. The Company measures the
impairment loss as the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds the
fair value of the asset. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company believes
that none of its long-lived assets are impaired.  

Receivables from tenants   

  Receivables
from tenants consist of rents, property taxes and other maintenance fees
payable under the terms of lease agreements.  Receivables are carried at original
invoice amount.  Management estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts by
regularly evaluating individual tenant receivables and considering the
collectability of balances due based on each tenant s financial condition,
credit history, and current economic conditions.  Receivables are written off
when deemed uncollectible.  Recoveries of receivables previously written off
are recognized in income when received.  The Company has an allowance for
uncollectible accounts of $53,809 and $52,255 at September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.    

Lease
commissions   

  Lease
commissions are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related leases,
using the straight-line method.  Lease commissions, net of accumulated
amortization, of $22,343 and $27,401 at September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, are included in Other Assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.  

Loan Fees   

  Loan
fees are capitalized and amortized over the term of the loan using the
straight-line method.  Loan fees, net of accumulated amortization, were $47,284
and $51,952 at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Loan fees are
included in Other Assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  

Income
taxes   

  The
Company files a consolidated income tax return.  Income taxes are provided for
the tax effects of transactions reported in the consolidated financial
statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related
primarily to differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax
basis of assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent
future tax consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or
deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.  Deferred
taxes are adjusted for changes in tax  laws  and tax rates when those  changes
are enacted.

-15-      

NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES,
Continued      

Income
taxes, continued   

  The
Company has adopted the provisions under ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes  ( ASC
740 ) which requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than
not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be
sustained upon examination by tax authorities.  A recognized tax position is
then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty
percent likely of being realized upon settlement.  The Company recognizes
accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a
component of income tax expense in its financial statements.  Management is not
aware of any uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.    

Statements
of equity   

  There
were no changes in equity other than net income for the years ended September
30, 2016 and 2015.  

Net
income per common share   

  Net
income per common share is calculated on the basis of the weighted average
number of shares outstanding.  The Company has no stock option plans, or other instruments
resulting in earnings per share dilution.  For 2016 and 2015 the weighted
average number of shares outstanding was 5,243,107.  Therefore, only basic net
income per common share is presented.  

Recently issued accounting standards   

  In
May 2014, the FASB issued guidance to change the recognition of revenue from
contracts with customers in future periods. The core principle of the new
guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of
goods and services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the
entity receives or expects to receive. The guidance will be effective for the
Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The
comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance
and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are
transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the
Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for
certain transactions.  The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one
requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of
prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with
disclosure of results under old standards.  The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of adoption and the implementation approach to be used.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued guidance that is intended to define management s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an
organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related
footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements,
management will need to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the
organization s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the
date that the financial statements are issued. The guidance will be effective
for the Company for the annual period ending September 30, 2017, and for annual
periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company does not expect this
guidance to have a material effect on its financial statements.                  

In
January 2015, the FASB issued guidance to eliminate from U.S. GAAP the concept
of an extraordinary item, which is an event or transaction that is both (1)
unusual in nature and (2) infrequently occurring. Under the new guidance, an
entity will no longer (1) segregate an extraordinary item from the results of
ordinary operations; (2) separately present an extraordinary item on its income
statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations; or (3) disclose
income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary item.
The guidance will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption
permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the
fiscal year of adoption. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a
material effect on its financial statements.

NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES,
Continued      

Recently issued accounting standards, continued   

In
February 2015, the FASB issued guidance which amends the consolidation
requirements and significantly changes the consolidation analysis required
under U.S. GAAP. Although the amendments are expected to result in the
deconsolidation of many entities, the Company will need to reevaluate all its
previous consolidation conclusions. The amendments will be effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2015, with early adoption permitted (including during an interim period),
provided that the guidance is applied as of the beginning of the annual period
containing the adoption date. The Company does not expect these amendments to
have a material effect on its financial statements.  

In
June 2015, the FASB issued amendments to clarify the Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC), correct unintended application of guidance, and make minor
improvements to the ASC that are not expected to have a significant effect on
current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most
entities. The amendments were effective upon issuance (June 12, 2015) for
amendments that do not have transition guidance. Amendments that are subject to
transition guidance will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is
permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company does not expect
these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.  

In
August 2015, the FASB issued amendments to the Interest topic of the Accounting
Standards Codification to clarify the SEC staff s position on presenting and
measuring debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit
arrangements. The amendments were effective upon issuance. The Company does not
expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.   

In
August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers. As a result of the deferral, the guidance in ASU
2014-09 will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017. The Company will apply the guidance using a modified
retrospective approach. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a
material effect on its financial statements.   

In
August 2015, the FASB issued amendments to the Interest topic of the Accounting
Standards Codification to clarify the SEC staff s position on presenting and
measuring debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit
arrangements. The amendments were effective upon issuance. The Company does not
expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.   

In
November 2015, the FASB amended the Income Taxes topic of the Accounting
Standards Codification to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes by
requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent
in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments will be
effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  The Company
will apply the guidance prospectively. The Company does not expect these
amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.   

In
February 2016, the FASB amended the Leases topic of the Accounting Standards
Codification to revise certain aspects of recognition, measurement,
presentation, and disclosure of leasing transactions. The amendments will be
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the
effect that implementation of the new standard will have on its financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows.   

In
March 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers topic of
the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify the implementation guidance on
principal versus agent considerations and address how an entity should assess
whether it is the principal or the agent in contracts that include three or
more parties. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments
to have a material effect on its financial statements.

NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES,
Continued      

In
March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify several aspects of the
accounting for share-based payment award transactions including the income tax
consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and
the classification on the statement of cash flows. Additionally, the guidance
simplifies two areas specific to entities other than public business entities
allowing them apply a practical expedient to estimate the expected term for all
awards with performance or service conditions that have certain characteristics
and also allowing them to make a one-time election to switch from measuring all
liability-classified awards at fair value to measuring them at intrinsic value.
The amendments will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods-public
business entities. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a
material effect on its financial statements.    

In
April 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers topic of
the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify guidance related to
identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual
property. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these
amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.   

In
May 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers topic of
the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify guidance related to
collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax, and
transition. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these
amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.   

In
August 2016, the FASB amended the Statement of Cash Flows topic of the
Accounting Standards Codification to clarify how certain cash receipts and cash
payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The
amendments will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years. The
Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its
financial statements.   

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other
standards-setting bodies are not expected to have a material impact on the
Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

Concentrations   

  Substantially
all of the Company s assets consist of real estate located in Richmond and
Columbia Counties in the State of Georgia, and in North Augusta, South
Carolina.  In 2016 and 2015, approximately 99% and 42%, respectively, of the
Company s revenues were rental related revenue, and approximately 0% and 53%,
respectively, of the Company s revenues were related to the sale of investment
property.  In 2016 and 2015, approximately 51% and 55%, respectively, of the
Company s rental revenues were earned from National Plaza.  Approximately 81%
of National Plaza is leased to one tenant, a regional food supermarket. 
Approximately 40% and 45% of the Company s rental revenues in 2016 and 2015,
respectively, were earned from the Evans Ground Lease, which is 100% leased to
a major national home improvement retailer.  

The
majority of the Company s receivables from tenants at September 30, 2016 and
2015 were receivable from two tenants, the regional food supermarket that
leases property at National Plaza, and the major national home improvement
retailer under the Evans Ground Lease.  

The
Company places its cash with high quality financial institutions. At times the
Company s cash balances may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limits.  

Subsequent events   

  Subsequent
events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but
before the financial statements are issued. Recognized subsequent events are
events or transactions that provide additional evidence about conditions that
existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in
the process of preparing financial statements.  Unrecognized
subsequent events are events that provide evidence about conditions that did
not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose after that date.

NOTE 2 - INVESTMENT PROPERTIES      

Investment
properties leased or held for lease   

  Investment
properties leased or held for lease to others under operating leases consist of
the following at September 30:   

Depreciation
expense totaled $186,526 and $159,345 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Approximately
81% of National Plaza is leased to a regional food supermarket.  The lease
requires minimum annual rental payments of $463,200.  The original term expired
in 2015 and the tenant exercised a 5 year option.  This lease is renewable for
a total of an additional 15 years at substantially similar lease terms.  The
lease provides for the supermarket to pay for interior maintenance and
utilities and property taxes on a proportional basis.   

The
lease agreement also provides for the Company to receive each year 1.25% of the
individual supermarket s gross sales in excess of approximately $37 million.
For 2016 and 2015, the supermarket did not achieve this gross sales level.   

In
construction of National Plaza, the supermarket contributed approximately
$493,000 to the cost of the construction.  The Company recorded the $493,000 as
deferred revenue and recognized $24,652 as revenue annually using the
straight-line method over the original twenty-year life of the lease with the
supermarket.   

In
2003, the Company entered into a 20-year ground lease arrangement on an outparcel
of National Plaza.  The ground lease provides for minimum rent of $45,000
annually, for the first 10 years of the lease.  The minimum rent increases by
approximately 10% after year 10 and then again after year 15 of the ground
lease.  Other lease agreements at National Plaza range in terms from one to
five years.  

The
Company entered into a long-term ground lease with a major national home
improvement retailer tenant and its developer in May 2006 on the approximately
18 acres of land in Columbia County, Georgia.  The agreement required monthly
rental payments of $20,833 during the development period, which was completed
in January of 2007.  Following the expiration of the development period, the
lease requires annual rental payments of $500,000 for the first 5 years then
increasing 5% in years 6, 11, and 16.  The lease has an option to renew at year
21 and another option every 5 years thereafter for a possible total lease term
of 50 years.  The lease provides for the tenant to pay for insurance and property
taxes.

NOTE 2 - INVESTMENT PROPERTIES, Continued      

Investment
properties leased or held for lease   

  In
June of 2015, the Company sold approximately 1 acre of undeveloped land
previously included as part of National Plaza adjoining Stanley Drive and a
residential house located on Stanley Drive resulting in a gain on sale of
$1,862,235. In September of 2015, the Company purchased a commercial building
consisting of approximately 25,000 square feet of retail space and 27,000
square feet of warehouse space on approximately 3.5 acres of land located on
Wrightsboro road.  The retail space is currently leased to a local retailer and
rent commenced on October 1, 2015. The related lease term is 10 years with
annual rental payments of $142,000, increasing to $153,000 at year 6.  The
warehouse space was available for lease as of September 30, 2016.    

Future
minimum rents receivable under the operating lease agreements are as follows
for the years ending September 30:  

Land
and improvements held for investment or development   

  The
Company also holds for investment or future development approximately 19.38
acres of undeveloped commercial land in North Augusta, South Carolina,
purchased in several parcels during 2007 and 2008.  The Company also owns
approximately 85 acres of land in south Richmond County and a 1.1 acre parcel
along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia, that adjoins the Company s National
Plaza investment property.  The aggregate cost of these investment properties
held for investment or development was $3,804,728 and $3,752,863 at September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Aggregate
maturities of notes payable are as follows at September 30, 2016:   

All
interest incurred for 2016 and 2015 was expensed by the Company.   

NOTE 4   INCOME
TAXES     

Deferred
income taxes are the result of qualified tax-free exchanges of property
transacted in previous years and reporting depreciation differently for income
tax purposes.  The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the
deferred tax liability are as follows as of September 30:  

Taxable
gains deferred by the Company in prior years and in the current year through
qualified tax-free like-kind exchanges totaled approximately $2,835,235. These
deferred gains for tax reporting comprise a substantial portion of the
Company's deferred income tax liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and 2015,
net of the effects of depreciation.  

The
provision for income taxes is as follows:  

The
provision for income taxes for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
differs from the amount obtained by applying the U.S. federal and state income
tax rate to pretax income due to the following:  

The
Company had no outstanding income tax payable at September 30, 2016 or 2015.    

-21-      

NOTE 5   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS     

The
Company purchases insurance from an insurance company of which a member of the
Company s Board of Directors is President Emeritus.  The Company s Board of
Directors believes that the insurance prices obtained from such company were
not in excess of prices that would have been paid had the Company obtained this
insurance from other sources.  

During
the fiscal year 2016, the Company paid $6,300 to a stockholder who is also the
son of the President for accounting services.  The Company believes the amount
paid is not in excess of prices that would have been paid had the Company
obtained these services from other sources.  

The
Company hired an attorney who is a member of the Company s Board of Directors. 
This attorney was hired to represent the Company in defending a claim brought
by a tenant in relation to disputed lease related charges.  This issue was
resolved in 2015.  Total fees paid to the attorney during the year ended
September 30, 2015 were $8,807.  In addition, in 2015, this same attorney was
paid an additional $25,000 related to other Company matters not associated with
litigation. No fees were paid to the attorney during 2016.  

In
November of 2015 the board of directors resolved to pay a $60,000 bonus to the
President and CEO in relation to negotiating the sale of the approximately 1
acre of vacant land previously included as part of National Plaza, the
residential house for lease located on Stanley drive and the purchase of the
commercial building on Wrightsboro Road.  

The
bonus was expensed in the quarter ended December 31, 2015. The company paid the
bonus in January 2016.  

In
the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, the Company borrowed $15,000 from a
member of the Company s board of Directors to meet short term cash flow needs. 
This amount was paid in full in December 2014.  

In
the second quarter of fiscal year 2014, the Company borrowed $50,000 from a stockholder,
who is also a member of the Flanagin family, to meet short term cash flow
needs.  Interest on this balance accrued at 5% and the outstanding principal
and interest was paid in full in March of 2015.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures.    

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

  Our
disclosure controls and procedures are our controls and other procedures that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, is processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.  Disclosure controls and
procedures include without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Our management, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in 17 C.F.R. Sections 240.13a-15d--15(e)) as of
September 30, 2016, and based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
concluded that such controls and procedures were ineffective as of September
30, 2016 as explained by the material weakness described in internal control
over financial reporting.  

There were no significant changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.  

Internal Controls over Financial Reporting   

  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).  A system of internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  

The Company s management has evaluated the effectiveness of
its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016.  Based on
this evaluation, the Company s management has evaluated and concluded that the
Company s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of
September 30, 2016 as explained by the material weakness described in internal
control over financial reporting:  

Due to its relatively small size and the nature of its
operations, having only two key employees, whom are also married to each other,
actively involved in management and financial reporting of the Company there is
a lack of necessary segregation of duties and accounting personnel with the
requisite knowledge of accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( GAAP ) and the financial reporting requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). There are insufficient
written policies and procedures to insure the correct application of accounting
and financial reporting with respect to the current requirements of GAAP and
SEC disclosure requirements.   

Notwithstanding the existence of this material weakness in
our internal control over financial reporting, our management believes that the
consolidated financial statements included in its reports fairly present in all
material respects the Company s financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows for the periods presented.  

The Company will continue its assessment on an ongoing
basis and when it becomes practicable, will make efforts to add personnel and
resources to address the material weakness.  There has been no change in its
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s
most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting.  

This annual report does not include an attestation report
of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting.  The Company s independent
registered public accounting firm was not required nor engaged to issue an
attestation on its internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to
temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and regulations of the SEC thereunder require the Company s executive
officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of the Company s Common
Stock, as well as certain affiliates of such persons, to file initial reports
of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC.  Executive
officers, directors and persons owning more than 10% of the Company s Common
Stock are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all
Section 16(a) forms they file.  Based solely on its review of the copies of
such forms received by it and written representations that no other reports
were required for those persons, the Company believes that during the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2016 the Company s executive officers, directors and
owners of more than 10% of its Common Stock complied with all filing
requirements.  

Gregory
B. Scurlock and M. David Alalof serve on the Company s audit committee, both
also serve on the Board of Directors and are experienced in financial matters.
