Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements 
    
  JRjr33, Inc. (formerly known as CVSL Inc.) (the  Company ) has prepared this Amendment No. 2 (this  Amendment ) to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   June 30, 2015  , which was originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on August 13, 2015, and later amended on August 14, 2015 (the "First Amended Form 10-Q"), to reflect restatements of the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   June 30, 2015  , the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three and six   month periods ended   June 30, 2015  , the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss for the   three and six   month periods ended   June 30, 2015  , and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six month period ended   June 30, 2015  , and the notes related thereto (the "Restatement".) The Restatement reflects certain year-end audit adjustments identified in connection with the audit of the financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and for the year then ended that have a material impact on the quarter ended   June 30, 2015  . In analyzing the adjustments the Company concluded that the respective quarterly impact of the adjustments is material and should be reflected in the quarters impacted. Additionally, in connection with the restatement process, the Company reviewed, corrected and modified, where appropriate, certain disclosures in Item 2 of Part I,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and the selected financial data as applicable.  For a description of the changes made in connection with the restatement, see Note 2,  Restatement of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  to the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report. 
    
  Additionally, effective as of March 7, 2016, the Company changed its name from CVSL Inc. to JRjr33, Inc.  The Company s new name is reflected in this document. 
    
  To assist in your review of this filing, this Amendment sets forth the First Amended Form 10-Q in its entirety.  However, this Amendment only amends and restates Item 1, Item 2 of Part I and Item 1A of Part II, and Item 4, in each case as a result of, and to reflect, the Restatement and related matters.  No other information in the First Amended Form 10-Q is amended hereby, except for the Company s name change.  The foregoing items have not been updated to reflect other events occurring after the filing of the First Amended Form 10-Q or to modify or update those disclosures affected by subsequent events.  In addition, pursuant to the rules of the SEC, Item 6 of Part II of the First Amended Form 10-Q has been amended to include currently dated certifications from the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Except for the foregoing amended information, this Amendment continues to speak as of the date of the First Amended Form 10-Q and the Company has not updated the disclosure contained herein to reflect events that occurred as of a later date.  Other events occurring after the filing of the First Amended Form 10-Q or other disclosures necessary to reflect subsequent events have been or will be addressed in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, which will be filed after the filing of this Form 10-Q/A, and any reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date of this filing. 
    
  The Company has not amended and does not intend to amend its previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  Management assessed its evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 in connection with its annual audit for the year ended December 31, 2015 which concluded, that a number of deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of the Company internal controls, collectively, represent material weaknesses in the Company internal control over financial reporting and, therefore, that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting for as of December 31, 2015. Since this restatement resulted from adjustments made during the year ended December 31, 2015, management's assessment is that the same material weaknesses disclosed in the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 apply for the period covered by this Amendment. For a description of the material weaknesses identified by management and management s plan to remediate those material weaknesses as disclosed in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, see  Part I, Item 4 - Controls and Procedures.

(  1  ) General 
    
  Interim Financial Information 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. The Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods on a consistent basis with the annual audited financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or that of a full year. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014 is derived from the December 31, 2014 audited financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the SEC on March 23, 2015 ("Form 10-K/A"). 
    
  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in these condensed consolidated financial statements. Business combinations accounted for as purchases are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.   
    
  Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  There have been no material changes to the Company s significant accounting policies during the   six months ended June 30, 2015  , as compared with those disclosed in the Company s consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Prior period financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 
       
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 
    
  Accounts Receivable 
    
  The carrying value of our accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, represents their estimated net realizable value. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on type of customer, age of outstanding receivable, historical collection trends, and existing economic conditions. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that a specific receivable balance may be unrealizable, further consideration is given to the collectability of those balances, and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. Receivable balances deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance. We have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of   $412,000   and   $170,000   as of   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company and its U.S. subsidiaries (excluding The Longaberger Company) file a consolidated Federal income tax return. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between financial statement and tax bases of asset and liabilities. Benefits from tax credits are reflected currently in earnings. We record income tax positions based on a more likely than not threshold that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities having full knowledge of all relevant information.

Translation of Foreign Currencies 
    
  The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of their country of domicile. Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollar amounts at period-end exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the weighted-average rates for the quarterly accounting period to which they relate. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated as a component of other comprehensive income. 
    
  Management has determined the functional currency of each primary operating subsidiary by evaluating indicators such as cash flows, sales prices, sales markets, expenses, financing, and intra-entity transactions and arrangements. We have listed below our primary operating subsidiaries for each of our companies and their functional and reporting currencies.

Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue 
    
  In the ordinary course of business we receive payments, primarily via credit card, for the sale of products at the time customers place orders. Sales and related fees such as shipping and handling, net of applicable sales discounts, are recorded as revenue when the product is shipped and when title and the risk of ownership passes to the customer. The Company presents revenues net of any taxes collected from customers which are remitted to governmental authorities. Payments received for undelivered products are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in current liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Certain incentives offered on the sale of our products, including sales discounts, described in the paragraph below are classified as program costs and discounts. A provision for product returns and allowances is recorded and is founded on historical experience and is classified as a reduction of revenues. At   June 30, 2015   and   2014  , our provision for sales returns totaled   $440,000   and   $227,000  , respectively. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In January 2015 the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-01 (ASU 2015-01),   Income Statement - Extraordinary Items and Unusual Items  . The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim reporting periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2015-01 eliminates the concept of extraordinary items from GAAP. We are in the process of assessing the effects of the application of the new guidance on our financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02 (ASU 2015-02),   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim reporting periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The new consolidation standard changes the criteria a reporting enterprise uses to evaluate if certain legal entities, such as limited partnerships and similar entities, should be consolidated. We are in the process of assessing the effects of the application of the new guidance on our financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 (ASU 2015-03),   Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim reporting periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard requires debt issuance costs to be classified as reductions to the face value of the related debt. We do not expect ASU 2015-03 to materially affect our financial position until we issue new debt.

     Table of Contents  

In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-11 (ASU 2015-11) to simplify the subsequent measurement of inventory. The new standard requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim reporting periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. 

(2) Restatement of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
    
  Correction of Accounting Errors 
    
  During the course of the filing of our Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, management identified certain year-end accounting adjustments. Management evaluated these adjustments and their effects on the Company's 2015 previously-filed quarterly financial statements, as amended,  and determined restated condensed consolidated financial statements should be filed to correct errors within our originally reported financial statements as of and for the   three and six   months ended   June 30, 2015  . 
    
  The most significant errors identified during the preparation of the Company's December 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements that affected the three and six month period ended   June 30, 2015   include the following: 

The correction of errors related to the recognition of revenue, accounts receivable and deferred revenue. The Company did not have the adequate accounting procedures to appropriately recognize and record revenues, accounts receivable and deferred revenue appropriately during Fiscal 2015.  

The correction of errors related to the appropriate recognition of share-based compensation expense. The Company did not appropriately account for certain share-based compensation plans, which required adjustments to the quarterly financial statements.  

The correction of errors related to the appropriate recognition of commissions expense on a quarterly basis. The Company did not appropriately calculate commissions expense related to the sales on a quarterly basis, which required an adjustment to the quarterly financial statements.  

The Company did not appropriately account for certain expenses attributable to acquisitions costs, which were incorrectly recorded a related party accounts receivable, which required an adjustment to the quarterly financial statements.  

The correction of errors related to the identification of assets included in cash and cash equivalents. The Company did not appropriately classify in transit receivables as accounts receivables during the year ended December 31, 2015.  
       
  Other Restatement and Reclassification Adjustments 
    
  In addition to correcting the accounting errors discussed above, the restated condensed consolidated financial statements for the   three and six   months ended   June 30, 2015   include adjustments for certain other accounting errors and reclassifications that were discovered subsequent to the issuance of the originally reported financial statements for the   three and six   months ended   June 30, 2015  . This adjustments include the following: 

Correcting the classification of revenues, program costs and discounts and commissions expense for certain of the subsidiaries.  

Other adjustments to correct for differences related to the recording accounts payable, interest expense, accrued commissions and accounts receivable write-offs.

(3) Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other Transactions 
    
  Kleeneze 
    
  On March 24, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Kleeneze Limited ( Kleeneze ), a direct-to-consumer business based in the United Kingdom. Kleeneze offers a wide variety of cleaning, health, beauty, home, outdoor and other products to customers across the United Kingdom and Ireland. 
    
  Pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement with Findel Plc ( Findel ), the Company purchased   100%   of the shares of Kleeneze from Findel for total consideration of   $5.1 million  . The consideration included   $3.0 million   of senior secured debt provided by HSBC Bank PLC, which has a term of   two years   and an interest rate per annum of   0.60%   over the Bank of England Base Rate as published from time to time (an interest rate of approximately   1.1%   at the time of the purchase). The remaining   $2.1 million   of consideration consisted of cash. Approximately   $1.9 million   in cash was acquired by the Company as part of the transaction at closing.  
    
  The Kleeneze acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company were recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date. The Company incurred approximately,   $113,000   of acquisition-related costs, all of which were expensed and included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
    
  The following summary represents the preliminary estimate of fair value of Kleeneze as of the acquisition date, March 24, 2015, and is subject to change following management s final evaluation of the purchase price allocation and fair value assumptions. 

Pro-forma Consolidated Statement of Operations  
    
  The following unaudited pro-forma financial information presents the Company's consolidated financial results for the three and   six months ended June 30, 2015   and 2014 as if the acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2014 (in thousands, except per share data): 

Notes to Pro-forma Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement 
    
  These pro-forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the acquisition been effective at the beginning of the respective periods and are not necessarily representative of future results. The pro-forma results include the following adjustments:

Losses were incurred as a result of the write down of intercompany receivables in the amount of   $33.1 million   that were forgiven prior to and in accordance with the transaction.

  Uppercase Living 
    
  On March 14, 2014, Uppercase Acquisition Inc. ( UAI ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired substantially all the assets of Uppercase Living, LLC, a direct-to-consumer company that sells an extensive line of customizable vinyl expressions for display on walls. UAI assumed certain liabilities and agreed to issue   254,490   shares of our common stock, par value $  0.0001   ("Common Stock") to the seller at a fair value of   $97,000   on the acquisition date. The Company also agreed to deliver   323,897   shares of its common stock at a fair value of $  123,000   to an escrow account for up to   24   months that will be issued to the seller upon remediation of certain close conditions. Since the Company did not deliver the shares of our Common Stock until April 2014, we recorded a payable at March 31, 2014 of $  220,000  . The payable was relieved in April 2014 once the stock was issued to the seller. The Company also agreed to pay the seller three subsequent contingent payments equal to   10%   of Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") for each of the years ending 2014 to 2016. There have been   no   payments related to this contingency, to date, and   no   liability is recorded on our balance sheet related to a contingent payment for UAI due to the Company's belief that it is not probable that UAI will achieve positive EBITDA during the period of the contingent payment.  Goodwill arising from the transaction totaled   $469,000  . 
    
  Dispositions 
    
  On July 31, 2014, the Company and our subsidiary TLC and CFI NNN Raiders, LLC. ("CFI"), entered into a Sale Leaseback Agreement (the "Sale Leaseback Agreement") pursuant to which TLC agreed to sell to CFI certain real estate owned by TLC and used by TLC in its manufacturing, distribution and showroom activities. The real estate described in the Sale Leaseback Agreement was purchased by CFI, for an aggregate purchase price of   $15.8 million  . A gain on sale of approximately   $2.5 million   was recorded associated with the sale. Because the transaction was part of a Sale Leaseback agreement that is being accounted for as a capital lease, the gain has been deferred and will be recognized over the fifteen (  15  ) year life of the Sale Leaseback Agreement.  
    
  Public Offering 
    
  On March 4, 2015 the Company closed an underwritten public offering of   6,667,000   shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of   6,667,000   shares of common stock at a combined offering price of   $3.00  . the Company granted the underwriters a   45  -day option to purchase up to an additional   1,000,050   shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of   1,000,050   shares of common stock to cover additional over-allotments and the underwriters. On March 4, 2015, the underwriters exercised a portion of the over-allotment option with respect to   113,200   warrants.   No   options were exercised as it relates to shares of common stock. The over-allotment option has expired and   no   additional shares of common stock or warrants were exercised. In addition, warrants for an additional   166,675   shares with the same terms mentioned previously were issued to the Company s underwriters per the terms of the Underwriting Agreement. 
    
  The warrants have a per share exercise price of   $3.75  , are exercisable immediately and will expire   five   years from the date of issuance. The exercise price of the warrant is subject to anti-dilutive adjustments (such as stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or other similar events). There are no cash settlement alternatives associated with the warrant agreements that would require the Company to pay a holder of such warrant cash at exercise or at any other event. The fair value of the warrants are approximately   $9.0 million   as calculated using the Black Scholes model. In accordance with US GAAP, the Company has accounted for the warrants as equity instruments.

     Table of Contents  

The Warrants will be exercisable at any time a registration statement registering the issuance of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants under the Securities Act is effective and available for the issuance of such shares, or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act is available for the issuance of such shares, by payment in full in immediately available funds for the number of shares of Common Stock purchased upon such exercise. If a registration statement registering the issuance of the shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants under the Securities Act is not effective or available and an exemption from registration under the Securities Act is not available for the issuance of such shares, the holder may, in its sole discretion, elect to exercise the Warrant through a cashless exercise, in which case the holder would receive upon such exercise the net number of shares of Common Stock determined according to the formula set forth in the Warrant.   
    
  A holder of Warrants will not have the right to exercise any portion of the Warrant if such exercise would result in the holder (together with its affiliates) beneficially owning in excess of   4.99%   of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Warrants. However, any holder may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of   9.99%   upon at least   61   days' prior notice from the holder to us. 
     Possible Issuance of Additional Common Stock under Share Exchange Agreement 
    
  Under a certain Share Exchange Agreement with Rochon Capital, which was amended during the fourth quarter of 2014 (the "Amended Share Exchange Agreement") Rochon Capital has rights to be issued the   25,240,676   shares of our common stock (the "Second Tranche Parent Stock") upon the public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has become an Acquiring Person (as defined below), or upon the commencement or announcement of a tender or exchange offer which would result in any person or group becoming an Acquiring Person. In such event, the Second Tranche Parent Stock will be issued to Rochon Capital, or a Permitted Transferee to whom the right has been transferred, within ten (  10  ) days of its written request, which request shall be in its sole discretion. A person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an "Acquiring Person," thus triggering the issuance of the Second Tranche Parent Stock to Rochon Capital, or a Permitted Transferee to whom the right has been transferred, upon acquiring, subsequent to the date of the Amended Share Exchange Agreement, beneficial ownership of   15%   or more of the shares of our common stock then outstanding. The term "Acquiring Person" shall not include (1) any person who acquires 15% or more of our shares of common stock in a transaction approved by John P. Rochon, (2) any affiliates of John P. Rochon or (3) any family members of John P. Rochon. 

(4) Marketable Securities 
    
  Our marketable securities as of   June 30, 2015   include fixed income investments classified as available for sale. At   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the fixed income securities totaled approximately   $6.0 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively. The cost of marketable securities purchases during the   six months ended June 30, 2015  , totaled   $18.9 million  . The proceeds from the sales of our marketable securities total   $13.9 million   and   $6.2 million  , respectively, for the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  . Our realized losses from the sale of our marketable securities totaled   $0   and   $58,000   for the   three months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. Our realized losses (gains) from the sale of our marketable securities totaled   $(192,000)   and   $552,000   for the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. The change in unrealized holding losses on the investments included in consolidated statements of other comprehensive income were   $0   and   $184,000   for the   three months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, and and   $7,000   and   $653,000   for the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  . The unrealized loss has been in that position for less than one year. Accordingly, management does not believe that the investments have experienced any other than temporary losses. 
    
  The Company elected fair value option to value the available for sale securities.  These securities are Level 1 securities estimated based on quoted prices in active markets.  In measuring the securities at an alternative adjusted cost basis, the adjusted cost equals the fair value reported as there were no unrealized gains or losses on the available for sale securities for the   three months ended June 30, 2015   and the   three months ended June 30, 2014  . 
    
  As of   June 30, 2015   our marketable securities investments had an effective maturity of   1.24   years and an average effective duration of   0.22   years. The majority of our marketable securities are invested in investment-grade corporate bonds.

The loan is denominated in pound sterling (GBP) and secured by approximately   $3.0 million   in cash shown as "restricted cash" on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and there are no other covenants related to the debt. The cash collateral is held in a GBP denominated account. 
    
  Promissory Note Payable to Former Shareholder of TLC 
    
  On March 14, 2013, we issued a   $4.0 million   promissory note in connection with the purchase of TLC. The Promissory Note bears interest at   2.63%   per annum, has a   ten  -year maturity, and is payable in equal monthly installments of outstanding principal and interest. 
    
  Promissory Note Lega Enterprises, LLC  
    
  On October 22, 2013, we issued a   $1.7 million   promissory note to Lega Enterprises, LLC (formerly Agel Enterprises, LLC) in connection with our acquisition of assets from Agel Enterprises, LLC. The promissory note bears interest at   5%   per annum, and is payable in equal monthly installments of outstanding principal and interest and matures on   October 22, 2018  . The note is secured by a lien on the assets of Agel.

  Capital Lease 
    
  On July 31, 2014, TLC entered into the Sale Leaseback Agreement with CFI NNN Raiders. The lease was deemed to qualify as a capital lease and the transaction is being accounted for as a sale leaseback arrangement. The gain arising from the sale of the   three   buildings and related property was deferred and is being recognized using the full accrual method over the term of the lease. The lease has been classified as a capital lease since the condition was met whereby the term of the lease is greater than 75% of the estimated economic life of the property. TLC has recorded the sale and removed the properties sold and related liabilities from the balance sheet. Since the lease is a capital lease, a leased asset will be recorded and depreciated over   15 years   using the straight-line method. 
    
  The payment under the lease will be accounted for as interest and payments under capital lease using   15   year amortization. The interest expense associated with the lease payments was   $552,000   and   $1.1 million   for the   three and six   months ended   June 30, 2015  , respectively. The gain on sales of real estate amortized over the life of the lease was   $42,000   and   $84,000   for the   three and six   months ended   June 30, 2015  , respectively. On   June 30, 2015   the current portion of the lease totaled   $35,000   and is included in other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Outstanding Warrants 
    
  On March 4, 2015 the Company raised proceeds of   $20 million   though the sale of   6,667,000   shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of   6,667,000   shares of its common stock at a combined offering price of   $3.00   in an underwritten public offering ( Offering ). The warrants have a per share exercise price of   $3.75  , are exercisable immediately and will expire   five years   from the date of issuance. The Company granted the underwriters a   45  -day option to purchase up to an additional   1,000,050   shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of   1,000,050   shares of common stock to cover additional over-allotments, if any. On March 4, 2015, the underwriters exercised a portion of their over-allotment option with respect to   113,200   warrants. In addition,   166,675   warrants were issued to the underwriters. The over-allotment option has expired as of the date of this filing. 
    
  The gross proceeds to the Company, including the underwriters' partial exercise of their over-allotment option, were approximately   $20,000,000   before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. Assuming the exercise of all   6,667,000   warrants at the exercise price of   $3.75   each, and assuming the Company maintains the conditions necessary for a cash exercise, the total additional gross aggregate proceeds to the Company would be   $25,001,250  . However, there can be no assurance that any warrants will be exercised or that the Company will maintain conditions necessary for a cash exercise. 
    
  On May 6, 2014, the Company issued warrants to purchase up to   12,500   and   6,250   shares of common stock in connection with exclusivity agreements. The warrants were exercisable commencing   75   days after their date of issuance, in whole or in part, until   one   year from the date of issuance for cash and/or on a cashless exercise basis at an exercise price of   $11.00   per share, representing the average closing price of our common stock for the   ten   days preceding the issuance. The fair value of the warrants on the date of issuance approximated   $116,000  . The warrants expired in May 2015 and were not exercised. 
    
  On July 2, 2014, the Company issued a warrant exercisable for   50,000   shares of common stock at an exercise price of   $12.80   per share in consideration of a   two  -year consulting agreement with an individual with direct selling industry experience. The warrant is exercisable for a   ten   day period commencing   720 days   after issuance. In addition, the warrant provides for piggyback registration rights upon request, in certain cases. The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants was subject to adjustment in the event of a stock dividend or our recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. On July 30, 2015 the Company executed an extension on the consulting agreement through July of 2017 in exchange for cancellation of the original warrant for   50,000   shares and the issuance of a new warrant exercisable for   50,000   shares of common stock at an exercise price of   $1.16   per share. The new warrant is also exercisable for a   ten   day period commencing   720   days after issuance.

(9) Fair Value 
    
  We established a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. These levels are determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Levels within the hierarchy are defined as follows: 
    
  Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; 
    
  Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets (other than those included in Level 1) which are    observable, either directly or indirectly; and 
    
  Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 
    
  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable trade and related party, and line of credit payable are considered to be representative of their respective fair values due to the immediate or short-term nature or maturity of these financial instruments. Our available for sale securities (Level 1) was   $6.0   million and (Level 2)   $0   at   June 30, 2015  . Available for sale securities totaled (Level 1)   $129,000   and (Level 2)   $862,000   at   December 31, 2014  .  
    
  The Company does not disclose the fair value of its debt instruments in accordance with the practicability exceptions laid out in ASC 820-10-15-3. Level 1 and 2 inputs are not available for the company s notes, and Level 3 inputs are not reliable in relation to determining the fair market value of the company s debt.  

(10) Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Company is occasionally involved in lawsuits and disputes arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, based upon advice of counsel, the likelihood of an adverse outcome against the Company is remote. As such, management believes that the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

  Worker s Compensation Liability 
    
  Certain of the Company s employees were covered under a self-insured worker s compensation plan which was replaced by a fully insured plan in December, 2014. The Company estimates its remaining self-insured worker s compensation liability based on past claims experience, and has an accrued liability to cover estimated future costs. At   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the accrued liability was approximately   $1.0 million  . There can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from the Company s estimates. 

(11) Income Taxes 
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  , the Company did not have a history of earnings that would allow it to record any of its net deferred tax assets without a corresponding valuation allowance. Therefore,   no   net deferred tax asset is reflected as of   June 30, 2015  . Additionally, due to some of its historical acquisitions which included intangibles with an indefinite life, the Company continues to accumulate a deferred tax liability which is recorded outside the net deferred tax asset and valuation allowance. A deferred tax liability is recorded within other current liabilities in the amount of   $547,000   within our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  The deferred tax expense for the   three and six   months ended   June 30, 2015   was approximately   $39,000   and   $73,000   respectively. Deferred tax expense for the   three and six   months ended   June 30, 2014   was approximately   $45,000   and   $89,000  , respectively. The Company records   no   current income tax expense related to its domestic activities due to historical or current net operating losses. Current tax expense for the   three and six   months ended   June 30, 2015   was   $156,000   and   $313,000  , respectively. Current tax expense for the three and   six months ended June 30, 2014   was approximately   $168,000   and   $403,000  , respectively. The current tax is based on the Company s activities in certain foreign jurisdictions which are currently profitable and   no   loss carryover is available to offset the income. 

(12) Share-Based Compensation Plans 
    
  The Company has   two   share-based compensation plans, the 2013 Director Smart Bonus Unit Plan and 2013 Smart Bonus Unit Award Plan. These plans provide for the issuance of a cash bonus for stock appreciation. A Committee comprised of members of the Board of Directors approves all awards that are granted under our share-based compensation plan. We classify the awards as a liability as the value of the award will be settled in cash, notes, or stock. The SARs Program vests over a period of   three years   and have a contractual term of   five years  . The liability related to these awards is included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Share-based compensation expense for the   three and six   months ended   June 30, 2015   was   $(30,000)   and   $(1.2) million  , respectively, compared to   $311,000   and   $398,000   for the   three and six   months ended   June 30, 2014  , respectively. The share-based compensation expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company s condensed consolidated income statements. As of   June 30, 2015  , total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation was   $96,000  , which is expected to be recognized over a   three  -year period. 
    
  On May 22, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors approved the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2015 Stock Plan ), which was subsequently approved by the Company s stockholders on June 23, 2015.  The 2015 Stock Plan allows for the issuance of up to   1,500,000   shares of common stock to be granted through incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and other stock-based awards to officers, other employees, directors and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries. The exercise price of stock options under the 2015 Stock Plan is determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, and may be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date the option is granted. The total number of shares of stock with respect to which stock options and stock appreciation rights may be granted to any one employee of the Company or a subsidiary during any one-year period under the 2015 plan shall not exceed   500,000  . Options become exercisable over various periods from the date of grant, and generally expire   10 years   after the grant date. As of June 30, 2015, there were approximately   1.4 million   options issued and outstanding under the 2015 Stock Plan. 
    
  On June 23, 2015,   50,000   options were granted to each of   two   executive officers of the Company. These options were issued at an exercise price of   $1.23  , and they vest in equal quarterly installments over the next   three   years beginning July 1, 2015. In accordance with ASC 718, these options are recognized as equity and expensed over the vesting period of   three years  . The fair value of the options are approximately   $117,000  , and   no   share-based compensation expense was recorded for the   three and six   months ended   June 30, 2015  . As of   June 30, 2015  , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based compensation was   $117,000  , which is expected to be recognized over a   three  -year period.

(13) Loss Per Share Attributable to the Company 
    
  In calculating loss per share, there were no adjustments to net loss for any periods presented. Outstanding warrants of approximately   6,996,875   and outstanding options of   100,000   were excluded from the fully diluted loss per share because inclusion of the warrants in the loss per share computation would be anti-dilutive. 

(14) Segment Information 
    
  The Company operates five operating segments, three of which are reportable segments, as a direct-to-consumer company that sells a wide range of products primarily through independent sales forces across many countries around the world. For the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   June 30, 2014  , approximately   $34.8 million   or   62.3%   and   $21.6 million   or   42.1%   of our revenues were generated in international markets, respectively. For the   three months ended June 30, 2015   and   June 30, 2014  , approximately   $25.7 million   or   71.4%   and   $10.8 million   or   43.9%   of our revenues were generated in international markets, respectively. We have grouped our products into the following   five   operating segments: Gourmet Food Products, Nutritional and Wellness, Home D cor, Publishing and Printing, and Other. Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the U.S. Of these five operating segments, Gourmet Food Products, Home D cor, and Nutritional and Wellness qualify as reportable segments in line with the specifications established in ASC 280-10-50.  
    
  We have identified three reportable segments as each segment engages in business activities, incurring expenses and producing revenues, the operating results of these segments are regularly reviewed by chief decision makers and there is discrete financial information available for each unit.  Also, the reported revenue of each reportable segment, both external and intercompany, is 10% or more of the combined revenue of all of the operating segments. The Company's three reportable segments are: 1) Gourmet Food Products, 2) Home D cor and 3) Nutritionals and Wellness. In prior periods we had identified and presented   one   reportable segment, with revenue broken down into   five   categories within our segment discussion. However, with the addition of Kleeneze, the continued growth of Your Inspiration at Home and anticipated future growth, both organically and through acquisitions, we now view the Company as having   five   operating segments,   three   of which are reportable segments as discussed above. As revenues have concentrated within these three reportable segments, our chief operating decision makers ("CODM") now view these segments as appropriate for decision making purposes because they each represent a significant part of our business. The following is a brief description of our three reportable segments. 
    
  Gourmet Food Products   - Segment consists of operations related to the production and sale of hand-crafted spices, oils and other food products from around the world. These operations have a presence in many of our markets both in the U.S. and internationally such as in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The Company's subsidiaries involved in this line of business are Your Inspiration at Home and My Secret Kitchen. 
    
  Home D cor   - Segment consists of operations related to the production and sale of premium hand-crafted baskets and the selling of products for the home, including pottery, cleaning, health, beauty, home, outdoor and customizable vinyl expressions for display. These operations are primarily located within the United States and the United Kingdom. The primary subsidiaries involved in this line of business are Kleeneze, TLC and Uppercase Living. 
    
  Nutritionals and Wellness   - Segment consists of operations related to the selling of nutritional supplements and skin care products. These operations have a presence in many foreign markets and over   40   countries such as Italy, Russia, Spain, and Israel. The subsidiary primarily involved in this type of products is Agel. 
    
  We note that these   three   segments exceed   75%   of The Company's consolidated revenue. Therefore, no further aggregation or disclosures are required for the remaining operating segments. 
    
  Although they do not qualify as reportable segments, we have included our Publishing and Printing and Other operating segments within the tables below to provide easier reconciliation to our results found on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and further transparency. The Publishing and Printing Segment consists of HCG and Paperly. The Other Segment consists of Tomboy Tools ("TBT").  
    
  In the tables below we present revenues and gross profit by operating segment. Our CODM evaluates performance on a segment basis from the standpoint of gross profit because many of our operating expenses are part of our shared services group at the corporate level, providing services to all of our operating segments, which is consistent with our post-acquisition integration strategies. In addition, there are numerous intercompany allocations and expenses that are most appropriately viewed on a consolidated basis for the Company as a whole. We do not have intersegment revenues.

In accordance with ASC 280-10-50, we have disclosed below the total assets for which there has been a material change from the amount disclosed in the last annual report. The total assets related to the reportable segment, Home D cor, increased over   $28.7 million   from   December 31, 2014   to   June 30, 2015   primarily due to the acquisition of Kleeneze in March 2015, which at   June 30, 2015  , had approximately   $20.8   million in total assets. 
    
  The below table shows the total assets for each reportable segment, which have been reconciled to the consolidated total assets (in thousands): 

(15) Related Party Transactions 
    
  During the fourth quarter of 2013, we renewed a Reimbursement of Services Agreement for a minimum of one year with Richmont Holdings - a closely held company by the Company's Chairman and CEO. The Company has begun to establish an infrastructure of personnel and resources necessary to identify, analyze, negotiate and conduct due diligence on direct-to-consumer acquisition candidates. However, we continue to need advice and assistance in areas related to identification, analysis, financing, due diligence, negotiations and other strategic planning, accounting, tax and legal matters associated with such potential acquisitions. Richmont Holdings and its affiliates have experience in the above areas and we wish to draw upon such experience. In addition, Richmont Holdings had already developed a strategy of acquisitions in the direct-to-consumer industry and has assigned and transferred to us the opportunities it has previously analyzed and pursued.  
    
  The Company has agreed to pay Richmont Holdings a reimbursement fee (the  Reimbursement Fee ) each month and we agreed to reimburse or pay the due diligence, financial analysis, legal, travel and other costs Richmont Holdings incurred in identifying, analyzing, performing due diligence, structuring and negotiating potential transactions. During the   three months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , the Company recorded Reimbursement Fees of approximately   $552,000   and   $480,000  , respectively, in selling, general and administrative expense located on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , the Company recorded Reimbursement Fees totaling approximately   $1.1 million   and   $960,000  , respectively. On February 26, 2015 we received a loan from Richmont Capital Partners V ( RCP V ) - a private equity investment arm of Richmont Holdings - in the amount of   $425,000  . The loan does not currently bear interest and has no set maturity date. As of   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , there was a related party payable balance of approximately   $396,000   and   $120,000   due to Richmont Holdings included in related party payables on the Company's balance sheet, respectively. 
    
  On September 25, 2012, upon acquisition of HCG, the Company inherited a related party shareholder payable of   $25,000   related to a loan made by HCG s former shareholder, Rochon Capital, to HCG for working capital. This amount is included in related-party payables within current liabilities. The loan does not currently have a set maturity date. 
    
  On June 27, 2014, Tamala L. Longaberger lent TLC   $42,000   and in connection therewith TLC issued a promissory note in the principal amount of   $42,000   to her. The note bears interest at the rate of   10%   per annum and matures on   June 27, 2015  . This amount is included in related-party payables within current liabilities.  
    
  On July 1, 2014, Tamala L. Longaberger lent AEI   $158,000   and in connection therewith AEI issued a promissory note in the principal amount of   $158,000   to her. The note bears interest at the rate of   10%   per annum and matures on   July 1, 2015   and is guaranteed by us. This amount is included in related-party payables within current liabilities.  
    
  On July 11, 2014, Tamala L. Longaberger lent AEI   $800,000   and in connection therewith AEI issued a promissory note in the principal amount of   $800,000   to her. The note bears interest at the rate of   10%   per annum and matures   July 11, 2015   and is guaranteed by us. This amount is included in related-party payables within current liabilities.  
    
  The Company determined not to service the loans related to Tamala L. Longaberger. As a result, in connection with these notes, Ms. Longaberger on   August 12, 2015   filed an action in Franklin County Common Pleas Court of Columbus, Ohio ( State Court Action ) seeking re-payment of the notes.  However, it is the Company s position that her claims are inextricably tied to the broader issues related to her terminated employment and the claims asserted against her by the Company and The Longaberger Company,

including breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, negligence, conversion, misappropriation of company funds, civil theft, breach of contract, and misappropriation of trade secrets, in an arbitration action in Columbus Ohio.  Therefore, on   October 12, 2015  , the Company filed a motion to compel arbitration and dismiss claims in the State Court Action. 

(16) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  The Company's management performs its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests annually or when changes in circumstances indicate an impairment event may have occurred by estimating the fair value of each reporting segment compared to its carrying value. The Company is aggregated into five operating segments presented herein (Note 14) based on similar economic characteristics, nature of products and services, nature of production processes, type of customers and distribution methods. Our   five   operating segments consist of: 1) Gourmet Food Products, 2) Home D cor, 3) Nutritionals and Wellness, 4) Publishing and Printing and 5) Other.  
    
  We use a discounted cash flow model and a market approach to calculate the fair value of our operating segments. The models include a number of significant assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and these estimates could be materially impacted by adverse changes in market conditions. Goodwill is measured for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded.  
    
  A significant decline in TBT revenue, the only subsidiary included in the 'Other' operating segment, indicated that the carrying amount of this reporting unit may be impaired.  The Company tested goodwill for impairment and determined that TBT's goodwill was impaired at June 30, 2015. Impairment charges totaled   $192,000   for the three and   six   month ending   June 30, 2015  , respectfully. Goodwill for TBT at   June 30, 2015   was approximately   $190,000  , net of accumulated impairment. Accumulated impairment of goodwill since the acquisition in October 2013 is approximately   $375,000  . 
    
  Indefinite-lived assets are measured for impairment by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying value. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded.  We determined that no impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets should be made in the period. 
    
  The following table provides the components of and changes in the carrying amount of Goodwill     (in thousands):

Identifiable Intangible Assets 
  The following table provides the components of Identifiable intangible assets (in thousands, except amortization period): 

Amortization 
  Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that contribute to our trade names, trademarks and other intellectual property is included in amortization of intangible assets. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in depreciation and amortization in the operating expenses. Total amortization expense for intangible assets were   $9,000   for the   second   quarter of   2015   and   $51,000   for the   second   quarter of   2014  , and   $(152,000)   for the first   six   months of   2015   and   $103,000   for the first   six   months of   2014  . 
    
  The   $(152,000)   amortization expenses recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2015, includes a   $170,000   amortization credit resulting from amortizing an indefinite-lived asset. The Company corrected this error as a restatement adjustment in the March 31, 2015 Form 10-Q/A. The pro-forma amortization expense for six months ended June 30, 2015 was   $18,000  , when adjusting for the amortization credit. 
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  , the estimated future amortization expense associated with our intangible assets for each of the five succeeding fiscal years ending December 31 is as follows (in thousands): 

Impairment 
    
  Indefinite-lived assets are measured for impairment by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying value. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. We determined that no impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets should be made in the quarter ending   June 30, 2015  .

(17)     Subsequent Events 
    
  On July 30, 2015, the Company entered into separate consulting agreements with   two   individuals pursuant to which each will provide certain business and financial advisory services to the Company. In connection with the consulting agreements, each consultant will be granted options exercisable for   500,000   shares of the Company s common stock, par value $  0.0001   per share  under the Company s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (for an aggregate of   1,000,000   shares).  The options have an exercise price $  1.27   and are fully vested on the date of the grant and expire on July 30, 2020. The options and the shares of Common Stock issuable thereunder were issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof. 
    
  On July 30, 2015, we executed an extension on the original consulting agreement we executed on July 2, 2014 with an individual who has extensive experience in the direct-to-consumer industry.  The agreement now ends in July of 2017.  The extension was in exchange for cancellation of the original warrant for   50,000   shares, issued on July 2, 2014, and the issuance of a new warrant exercisable for   50,000   shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $  1.16   per share.  The warrant is exercisable for a   ten   day period commencing   720   days after issuance. In addition, the warrant provides for piggyback registration rights upon request, in certain cases. The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is subject to adjustment in the event of a stock dividend or our recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation.

  Business Overview 
    
  We operate a multi-brand platform in the direct-to-consumer sector that employs innovative operational, marketing, social networking and e-commerce strategies to drive a high-growth global business. We are engaged in a long-term strategy to develop a global, diverse company that combines the entrepreneurship, innovation and relationship-based commerce of micro-enterprise with the infrastructure and operational excellence of a highly scalable public company. 
    
  We follow a simple strategy: We have one  product,  which is opportunity for the independent sellers in our sales forces. They earn money for their families and have the freedom to decide for themselves how much time and effort to put into their business. Our platform of multiple brands supports that opportunity. We do not consider our strategy to be a  rollup.  Each of our companies keeps its own distinct brand identity, its own sales force, its own compensation plan and its own product line. Behind the scenes, in operational areas such as finance, accounting, technology and supply chain, we find synergies and achieve efficiencies by eliminating duplication of effort and cost. 
    
  We have grown at a rapid pace as a result of our acquisitions through June 30, 2015. With each acquisition we have expanded our product base and our base of independent sales representatives and potential customers. This convergence of personal relationships, social media and relationship-based commerce is what gives us our unique blend of attributes for growth. As we scale up through additional acquisitions and organic growth, we expect that these attributes will be amplified. 
    
  This sector has unique characteristics quite unlike the traditional retail sector, and it must be managed accordingly. Our team has a proven skill set in the direct-to-consumer sector. Our team has developed and honed its skills over decades of work within the direct-to-consumer category at multiple companies. We apply our knowledge and experience to the companies in our portfolio. 
    
  We remain continually open to pursue good acquisition opportunities that come along at any time. As interesting acquisition opportunities arise, we conduct a thorough evaluation of them. We intend to be opportunistic about acquisitions. We also will consider opportunities to extend our brands into additional markets wherever possible. That being said, our primary focus currently is to be as effective as possible in managing and improving our existing businesses. 
    
  We believe that our visibility in the direct-to-consumer industry continues to increase, as news circulates through the industry and increasing numbers of people in the industry became more familiar with our strategy and progress. We also believe that this growing visibility has made us more attractive to potential acquisition targets. At the same time the costs of growth through acquisition, such as legal costs and other due diligence-related costs, the costs associated with our up-listing to the NYSE MKT last December, systems implementation and other transitional operating costs have been significant and have affected our profitability. Conditions affecting each individual company have posed challenges to our company as a whole. However, we anticipate that our operating  
  
   28 

     Table of Contents  

and net losses will continue to decrease over time as we implement certain operating and administrative efficiencies for the acquired companies as a whole. We are confident that our strategy is working and believe that second quarter results show good progress in executing our strategy. 
    
  Our results can be impacted by economic, political, demographic and business trends and conditions in the United States as well as globally. A rise or fall in economic conditions, including such factors as inflation, economic confidence, recession and disposable income can affect the direct selling industry, as the independent sales representatives who comprise the sales forces of our various companies make decisions based, at times, on those economic factors. A weak economy historically has been favorable to micro-enterprise/direct-to-consumer companies, because in times of economic distress, increasing numbers of individuals look for ways to supplement or replace their income and becoming an independent sales representative can provide this supplemental income. Similarly, when jobs are lost, many are forced to seek independent means of earning a living or supplementing family income. However, economic distress can reduce customers' disposable income, making it more difficult to convince a customer to buy a non-essential product or service from a direct-to-consumer company and therefore negatively impacting our revenue. 
    
  Current Portfolio 
    
  Our disciplined acquisition strategy is derived from the industry knowledge and operating expertise of our management team, which we believe allows us to identify, evaluate and integrate direct-to-consumer companies that can benefit from our company s resources, while contributing to our overall growth strategy. We have grown at a rapid pace as a result of our recent acquisitions and intend to continue to opportunistically pursue additional acquisitions while improving the fundamental strength of our existing businesses. As of the date of this filing, our platform of direct-to-consumer brands is comprised of the following eight businesses: 

Through a series of eight acquisitions of direct-to-consumer companies that offer a diverse product mix, we have expanded our product offerings as well as our base of sales representatives and customers. We completed the acquisition of the assets or stock of the following seven companies in 2013 and 2014: The Longaberger Company ( TLC ) (a direct-to-consumer brand selling premium hand-crafted baskets and a line of products for the home), Your Inspiration at Home, Ltd. ( YIAH ) (a direct-to-consumer brand selling hand-crafted spices from around the world), Tomboy Tools, Inc. ("Project Home ) (a direct-to-consumer brand selling a line of tools designed for women as well as home security monitoring services), Agel Enterprises, LLC ( Agel ) (a direct-to-consumer brand selling nutritional supplements and skin care products), My Secret Kitchen Limited ( MSK ) (a direct-to-consumer brand selling a unique line of gourmet food products), Paperly, LLC ( Paperly ) (a direct-to-consumer brand selling custom stationery and paper products), and Uppercase Living, LLC ( Uppercase ) (a direct-to-consumer brand selling customizable vinyl expressions for display on walls). 
    
  During the first quarter of 2015, we completed the acquisition of our eighth direct-to-consumer company, Kleeneze Limited ( Kleeneze ), which is based in the United Kingdom. With this acquisition, we have gained a large presence in an already strong United Kingdom market. Kleeneze is one of the United Kingdom s longest-operating, largest and best-known direct-to-consumer businesses. Founded in 1923, Kleeneze has grown into a community of more than 7,000 independent distributorships, offering a wide variety of several thousand cleaning, health, beauty, home, outdoor and other products to customers across the U.K. and Ireland. Lastly, since Kleeneze currently only operates in the United Kingdom and Ireland, opportunities to leverage our platform to enter into other markets exist.

Overview of Companies 
  (in alphabetical order) 
    
  Agel Enterprises 
    
  In October 2013, we formed Agel Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation which acquired substantially all of the assets of Agel Enterprises, LLC. Agel is a direct-to-consumer business based in Utah that sells nutritional supplements and skin care products through a worldwide network of independent sales representatives. Agel's products are sold in over 40 countries. Agel acquired substantially all the assets of Agel Enterprises, LLC in exchange for total consideration of 372,330 shares of our common stock (of which 28,628 shares were issued in January 2014), the delivery of a purchase money note, dated the closing date, in the original principal amount of $1.7 million and the assumption of $9.1 million in liabilities, which after the transaction were reflected in our financial statements in addition to the additional $1.7 million purchase money note. 
    
  Nutrition and wellness is a significant part of the direct-to-consumer sector.  Agel brings to the portfolio a unique and appealing line of nutritional products in gel form, which are more easily absorbed by the body than nutritionals in pill form.  Agel also includes a skin care line under the brand name Ageless, and its presence in that market gives the Company an opportunity to market additional skin care products in the future, which we intend to do.  Finally, Agel provides the Company with a global footprint in more than 40 countries around the world.  We believe that this global presence can help other subsidiaries and brands over time and can reduce the costs of entry into international markets in which Agel already has a presence. 
    
  Happenings Communications Group 
    
  On September 25, 2012, we acquired 100% of HCG as part of the Share Exchange Agreement. HCG publishes a monthly magazine, Happenings Magazine, that highlights events and attractions, entertainment and recreation, and people and community in Northeast Pennsylvania. HCG also provides marketing and creative services to various companies, and can provide such services to direct-to-consumer businesses. Services HCG provides may include creating brochures, sales materials, websites and other communications for independent sales representatives and ultimate customers. As a result, HCG serves as an "in-house" resource for providing certain marketing and creative services. 
    
  Kleeneze 
    
  In March 2015, we completed the acquisition of Kleeneze Limited ( Kleeneze ), a direct-to-consumer business based in the United Kingdom. Pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) with Findel plc ( Findel ), the Company purchased 100% of the shares of Kleeneze from Findel for total consideration of $5.1 million. The consideration included $3.0 million of senior secured debt provided by HSBC Bank PLC, which debt has a term of two years and an interest rate per annum of 0.60% over the Bank of England Base Rate as published from time to time (an interest rate of 1.1% at the time of the purchase). The remaining   $2.1 million   of consideration consisted of cash. Approximately   $1.9 million   in cash remained with the Company at closing.  
    
  Kleeneze is the largest of our current companies in terms of revenue. We acquired it because we valued the established, 90-year-old brand, the loyal seller network, and the opportunity for expansion into other European markets. Kleeneze s biggest challenge when we acquired it was the fact that its previous owner was not experienced in the direct-to-consumer sector and, thus, did not appreciate the uniqueness and the nuances of managing a direct-to-consumer company. In addition, Kleeneze had a sister company, under its previous ownership group, which directly competed with Kleeneze s sales network at lower prices with similar products. This had a damaging effect on the morale of the sales field. 
    
  We have re-affirmed for Kleeneze s sales network and employees our respect for their brand and given confidence that their company is in the hands of ownership which understands their channel.  Such confidence, in our view, will help Kleeneze realize its potential over the coming years as we seek operational efficiencies and growth opportunities.

The Longaberger Company 
    
  In March 2013, we acquired a 51.7% controlling interest in TLC. TLC is a direct-to-consumer business based in Newark, Ohio which sells premium hand-crafted baskets and a line of products for the home, including pottery and other home d cor products, through a nationwide network of independent sales representatives. TLC also has a retail destination in Frazeysburg, OH, called The Longaberger Homestead. We acquired, in two separate transactions, a total of 1,616 shares of TLC's Class A common stock ("TLC Class A Common Stock"), representing 64.6% of the issued and outstanding TLC Class A Common Stock, which class has sole voting rights at TLC, and acquired 968 shares of TLC's Class B common stock, which are non-voting shares ("TLC Class B Common Stock" and, together with the TLC Class A Common Stock, the "TLC Stock"). Together, the two transactions resulted in the Company acquiring 51.7% of all issued and outstanding TLC Stock. As consideration, we issued to a trust of which Tamala Longaberger is the trustee (the "Trust"), a Convertible Subordinated Unsecured Promissory Note, dated March 15, 2013, in the original principal amount of $6.5 million (the "Convertible Note"), and, to TLC, we issued a ten year, $4.0 million unsecured promissory note, dated March 14, 2013, payable in monthly installments. On June 14, 2013, the Convertible Note was converted into 1,625,000 shares of our common stock. At the time of the acquisition, TLC had $22.9 million in liabilities, which after the transaction were reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements in addition to the additional debt incurred as a result of the issuance of the notes to the Trust and TLC. 
    
  Along with its well-respected brand, its hand-crafted products and its loyal sales force, one of the many aspects of TLC's operation that was attractive to us was its abundance of assets. TLC had a variety of fixed assets and real estate that were being underutilized in TLC's operations. We have sold assets such as land and buildings that were not core to TLC's business and we intend to continue to make use of the remaining assets at our other companies (including those we own now and those we will acquire in the future). For example, YIAH has begun operations in North America, operating out of TLC's Ohio distribution center and Project Home has shifted inventory and distribution to TLC's Ohio facilities, as well. While we intend to find new uses for certain under-utilized assets, other assets owned by TLC may be sold to further reduce our liabilities and generate free cash flow. 
    
  In the turnaround of TLC, we have faced a number of challenges that had to be overcome in order to put the company on sound footing for long-term success. One challenge was excessive discounting, which is counterproductive when dealing with a hand-crafted, premium product. We have corrected that problem by returning to a more predictable and appropriate pricing model, which not only helps our profitability, but benefits the Longaberger sales force by generating healthier commissions for them. 
    
  A second challenge was self-inflicted competition. Longaberger had opened a number of  factory stores  that competed with their own sales force. We recently announced and put an end to that unwise practice and the sales force has responded very positively. 
    
  A third challenge involved leadership and the need for effective leadership for Longaberger. In late May 2015, John Rochon Jr., our vice chairman and chief financial officer, stepped in to provide much-needed hands-on leadership as chairman, president and CEO of Longaberger. Mr. Rochon Jr. grew up in the direct-to-consumer sector and, therefore, understands the importance of effective and engaged leadership to the sales force. The response from the sales force to his leadership has been overwhelmingly positive. In July 2015, Mr. Rochon led the annual Longaberger sales convention, which was held for the first time in 30 years in the Ohio community of Dresden where The Longaberger Company was born. This well-received action reinforced our respect for Longaberger's heritage and the impact it can have on the business. 
    
  My Secret Kitchen 
    
  In December 2013, we formed CVSL A.G., a Switzerland company, which acquired a 90% controlling interest of MSK, an award-winning United Kingdom-based direct-to-consumer company which sells a unique line of food products. We acquired substantially all of the stock of MSK in exchange for total consideration of 15,891 shares of our common stock and payment of an earn-out of 5% of MSK's EBITDA from 2014 to 2016. The shares of our common stock for this acquisition were issued in January 2014. At the time of the acquisition, MSK had approximately $169,000 in liabilities, which after the transaction were reflected in our financial statements. 
    
  Paperly 
    
  In December 2013, we formed Paperly, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which acquired substantially all of the assets of Paperly, a direct-to-consumer company that allows its independent sales representatives to work with customers to design and create custom stationery through home parties, events and individual appointments. We acquired substantially all the assets of Paperly in exchange for total consideration of 7,797 shares of our common stock and payment of an earn out of 10% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") from 2014 to 2016. The shares of our common stock for this acquisition were issued in 2014. We assumed liabilities of approximately $110,000 in connection with the acquisition.

Tomboy Tools (Project Home) 
    
  In October 2013, we formed CVSL TBT, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, which acquired substantially all of the assets of Tomboy Tools, Inc., a direct-to-consumer company which sells a line of tools designed for women as well as home security systems. We acquired substantially all the assets of Tomboy Tools, Inc. in exchange for total consideration of 88,349 shares of our common stock and the assumption of liabilities of approximately $471,000 in connection with the acquisition. For a period of time TBT used the name "Project Home," but we are returning to the use of the name "Tomboy Tools," as we believe it is a stronger brand name. 
    
  Uppercase Living 
    
  In March 2014, we formed Uppercase Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation which acquired substantially all the assets of Uppercase Living, a direct-to-consumer company which sells customizable vinyl expressions for display on walls. Consideration consisted of 28,920 shares of our common stock and payment of an earn out equal to 10% of the EBITDA of the subsidiary that acquired the assets for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 payable in cash or shares of our common stock at our discretion. The shares of common stock for this acquisition were issued in April and June 2014. We assumed liabilities of approximately $471,000 in connection with the acquisition. 
    
  Your Inspiration At Home 
    
  In August 2013, we formed Your Inspiration At Home, Pty. Ltd., an Australian corporation which acquired substantially all of the assets of YIAH. YIAH is an innovative and award-winning direct-to-consumer company which sells hand-crafted spices from around the world. YIAH originated in Australia and has expanded its operations to the United States, Canada and New Zealand. We acquired substantially all the assets of YIAH in exchange for total consideration of 225,649 shares of our common stock and the assumption of liabilities of approximately $141,000 in connection with the acquisition. 
    
  Since the Company acquired YIAH, it has grown significantly and is the primary driver of growth in our gourmet food segment. YIAH primarily needed operational support and financial management, which we provided. YIAH also utilizes existing resources, such as distribution space in Ohio, to launch and support its expansion into North America. We expect that YIAH will continue to look to open new geographies in the future, particularly in areas where other subsidiaries have existing infrastructure, resources, assets and registrations that could be leveraged.

Revenue (in thousands): 

Total revenue for the   three months ended June 30, 2015     increased   by   $11.4 million  , or approximately   46.5%  , compared to the same period in   2014  , primarily due to the impact of a full quarter of our recent acquisition of Kleeneze at the end of March of 2015. Revenue for the   six months ended June 30, 2015     increased   by   $4.6 million  , or approximately   9.1%  , compared to the same period in   2014  . Results for the   six months ended June 30, 2015   were impacted by turnaround actions taken at TLC such as narrowing product lines, focusing on quality products, closing the Longabeger's discount outlet stores and reducing the emphasis on overall program discounts at the TLC.  We anticipated a short-term negative revenue impact from these steps but believe that it will lead to growth and strength in the fundamental business over the long-term.  The increase in revenues due to the inclusion of Kleeneze in our results, since our acquisition in March of 2015, was offset partially by the decline in revenue at TLC. For the   three months ended June 30, 2015  , the net impact of the decrease in TLC revenues against the increase in revenues from Kleeneze was an increase in revenue of   $9.9 million  . For the   six months ended June 30, 2015  , the net impact of the decrease in TLC revenues against the increase in revenues from Kleeneze was an increase in revenue of   $4.3 million  .  
    
  The Company operates five operating segments, three of which are reportable segments, as a direct-to-consumer company that sells a wide range of products primarily through independent sales forces across many countries around the world. For the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   June 30, 2014  , respectively approximately   $34.8 million  , or   62.3%   of our revenues, and   $21.6 million  , or   42.1%   of our revenues, were generated in international markets. For the   three months ended June 30, 2015   and   June 30, 2014  , respectively approximately   $25.7 million  , or   71.4%   of our revenues, and   $10.8 million  , or   43.9%   of our revenues, were generated in international markets. We have grouped our products into the following five operating segments: gourmet foods, nutritional and wellness, home d cor, publishing and printing, and other. Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the U.S. Of these 5 operating segments, Gourmet Food Products, Home D cor, and Nutritional and Wellness qualify as reportable segments in line with the specifications established in ASC 280-10-50. 
    
  For the   three months ended June 30, 2015   and   June 30, 2014  , approximately   $5.2 million  , or   14.4%   of our revenues, and   $1.6 million  , or   6.7%   of our revenues, respectively, were derived from the sales of gourmet food products;   $8.0 million  , or   22.2%   of our revenues, and   $10.0 million  , or   40.5%   of our revenues, respectively, were derived from the sale of nutritional and wellness products;   $22.5 million  , or   62.3%   of our revenues, and   $12.4 million  , or   50.6%   of our revenues, respectively, were derived from the sale of home d cor products;   $271,000  , or   0.8%   of our revenues, and   $319,000  , or   1.3%   or our revenues, respectively, were derived from the sale of our publishing and printing services and products; and for the   three months ended June 30, 2015   and   June 30, 2014  ,   $127,000  , or   0.4%   of our revenues, and   $232,000  , or   0.9%   of our revenues, respectively, were derived from the sale of our other products.  
    
  For the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   June 30, 2014  , approximately   $7.7 million  , or   13.8%   of our revenues, and   $2.6 million  , or   5.1%   of our revenues, respectively, were derived from the sales of gourmet food products;   $14.8 million  , or   26.4%   of our revenues, and   $20.2 million  , or   39.3%   of our revenues, respectively, were derived from the sale of nutritional and wellness products;   $32.6 million  , or   58.4%   of our revenues, and   $27.5 million  , or   53.6%   of our revenues, respectively, were derived from the sale of home d cor products;   $504,000  , or   0.9%   of our revenues, and   $613,000  , or   1.2%   of our revenues, respectively, were derived from the sale of our publishing and printing services and products; and for the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   June 30, 2014     $280,000  , or   0.5%   of our revenues, and   $422,000  , or   0.8%   of our revenues, respectively, were derived from the sale of our other products.

Gross profit (in thousands): 

The gross profit increased by   $5.0 million   in the   three months ended June 30, 2015   compared to the same period in   2014  . For the   six months ended June 30, 2015   gross profit increased by   $2.8 million   compared with the same period in   2014  . Gross profit margins decreased to   51.5%   from   54.9%   for the   three months ended June 30, 2015   compared to the same period in   2014  . The decrease  to gross profit margins is partially a result of Kleeneze having lower margins compared to many of the other companies in the portfolio. This is evidenced by the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue which increased  from   23.8%   to   30.8%   for the   three months ended June 30, 2014   and   2015  , respectively. For the   six months ended June 30, 2015  , gross profit margins stayed consistent with the prior year at   53.6%   compared to   53.0%   for the   six months ended June 30, 2014  .  
    
  For the   three months ended June 30, 2015   and   June 30, 2014  , the gourmet food segment's gross profit margin   decreased   from   54.1%    to   42.8%   while the gross profit   increased     $1.3 million   compared to the prior year. The home d cor segment's gross profit margin   increased   from   30.0%   to   43.1%    while the gross profit   increased     $5.9 million   compared to the prior year. The nutritional and wellness segment's gross profit margin   decreased   from   85.7%   to   80.2%   while the gross profit   decreased     $2.1 million   compared to the prior year. The publishing and printing segment's gross profit margin   increased   from   64.6%   to   66.1%   while the gross profit   decreased     $27,000   compared to the prior year. The other segment's gross profit margin   decreased   from   63.8%   to   52.8%   while the gross profit   decreased     $81,000   compared to the prior year. 
    
  For the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   June 30, 2014  , the gourmet food segment's gross profit margin   decreased   from   52.4%    to   35.6%   while the gross profit   increased     $1.4 million   compared to the prior year. The home d cor segment's gross profit margin   increased   from   31.3%   to   45.9%   while the gross profit   increased     $6.4 million   compared to the prior year. The nutritional and wellness segment's gross profit margin   decreased   from   82.3%   to   79.3%   while the gross profit   decreased     $4.9 million   compared to the prior year. The publishing and printing segment's gross profit margin   decreased   from   64.1%   to   62.9%   while the gross profit   decreased     $76,000   compared to the prior year. The other segment's gross profit margin   increased   from   56.6%   to   64.6%   while the gross profit   decreased     $58,000   compared to the prior year. 
    
  Operating Losses 
    
  Operating losses decreased by   $829,000   in the   three months ended June 30, 2015   compared to the same period in   2014  . For the   six months ended June 30, 2015   operating losses increased by   $629,000   compared with the same period in   2014  . These results are in line with our expectations at this stage in the execution of our strategy and represent a positive trend toward positive operating margins as we continue to improve the portfolio businesses and gain additional cost efficiencies from eliminating redundant overhead. In the last two years we have purchased eight direct-to-consumer companies, up-listed to the NYSE MKT and executed a $20.0 million equity raise. We believe we are poised for the next stage of our growth having built our current platform. We believe our strategy will continue to have benefits from scale and will continue to aggressively pursue accretive acquisition targets to improve our operating results.

Operating Expenses 
    
  Commissions and Incentives 
    
  Total commissions and incentives as a percentage of revenue decreased to   23.4%   from   24.4%   for the   three months ended June 30, 2015   compared to the same period in   2014  . For the   six months ended June 30, 2015   total commissions and incentives as a percentage of revenue increased to   25.5%   from   25.3%   for the same period in   2014  . Program costs and discounts as a percent of revenue decreased to   17.2%   from   19.9%   for the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, and decreased to   17.7%   from   21.2%   for the   three months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, primarily as a result of less discounting at TLC. We believe it is useful to compare both commissions and incentives along with program costs and discounts together as a percentage of revenue, as well. Together, these two items represented   42.7%   and   45.2%   of revenue for the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, and   41.1%   and   45.6%   for the   three months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") incurred during the   three months ended June 30, 2015   increased to   $12.8 million   compared to   $11.0 million   for the same period in   2014  . However, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from   44.7%   to   35.4%   as a result of Kleeneze having lower costs as a percent of revenue as well as cost reductions at the Company's subsidiaries, primarily TLC. For the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, SG A increased to   42.0%   from   39.0%  . We expect that these costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue as we continue to find and implement cost efficiencies and as we continue to grow, as many of our SG A expenses will not increase as we continue to scale up our business through organic and acquisition-based growth.  
    
  Gain/Loss on Marketable Securities 
    
  Our marketable securities as of   June 30, 2015   include fixed income and equity investments classified as available for sale. At   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the fair value of the fixed income securities totaled approximately   $6.0 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively. Our realized losses (gains) from the sale of our marketable securities totaled   $0   and   $58,000   for the   three months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. Our realized losses (gains) from the sale of our marketable securities totaled   $(192,000)   and   $552,000   for the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
    
  Non-Controlling Interest 
    
  Non-controlling interest losses was approximately   $1.7 million   for the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. Non-controlling interest had losses of approximately   $1.0 million   for the   three months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively.  
    
  Additional Performance Indicators - EBITDA Metrics 
    
  We believe that having a reliable measure of the Company's financial health is invaluable both to us and to potential business partners. We believe that Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA ) and Adjusted EBITDA can be useful performance indicators over time. 
    
  We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because this is a key metrics used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends in our business. In particular, the exclusion of certain specific expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.  
    
  These measures are not defined by GAAP and the discussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to conflict with or change any of the GAAP disclosures described above. Management considers these measures in addition to operating income to be important to estimate the enterprise and stockholder values of the Company, and for making strategic and operating decisions. In addition, analysts, investors and creditors use these measures when analyzing our operating performance, financial condition and cash generating ability. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as a substitute for net income (loss) (as determined in accordance with GAAP) for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance of financial position, as Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP.

The following table presents a reconciliation of Net Loss to EBITDA (Losses) and Adjusted EBITDA (Losses) for each of the periods presented:

Specific Capital Market Event Expense 
    
  Specific Capital Market Event Expense would include expenses related to certain activities such as listing or other exchange fees, road show and other expenses related to equity offerings, and fees associated with filings like our S-3 expensed in a given period. 
    
  Specific M A Deal/Diligence Expense 
    
  These are specific expenses related to certain legal and due diligence costs for potential acquisition targets. 
    
  M A Infrastructure Expense 
    
  These are expenses related to our M A infrastructure, such as our M A team and costs associated with supporting their efforts, as well as expenses related to our Reimbursement of Services Agreement with Richmont Holdings. We expect these costs to continue as we look for opportunistic acquisition targets and participate in other deal-related activities. 
    
  Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
                
    Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
                
    Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation; 
                
    Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 
                
    Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related costs; and 
                
    Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
       
  Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations.  We also have access to the capital markets through public offerings, such as the one we completed in March 2015.  Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in short-duration fixed income mutual funds, which may include investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were   $11.7 million   as of   June 30, 2015  , an increase of   $8.1 million   from   December 31, 2014  , primarily due to our March 2015 public offering and cash acquired in our acquisition of Kleeneze, offset by cash used for the acquisition of Kleeneze, paying down accounts payable balances at TLC and other uses of cash for operations. 
    
  Currently the Company does not have a revolving credit facility or an other working capital facility. Although we believe we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents, as well as marketable securities, to fund our business currently, we recognize that there may be additional needs for working capital as we invest in our current businesses and as we look for accretive future acquisitions. We are constantly evaluating the most efficient capital available for these purposes. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Cash used in operating activities for the   six months ended June 30, 2015   was   $(6.4) million  , as compared to net cash used in operating activities of   $(5.0) million   for the   six months ended June 30, 2014  . Our principal uses of cash have included legal and professional fees associated with the acquisitions; legal, due diligence and other fees related to other potential acquisitions; the cost of buying inventory; labor and benefits costs; and commissions and incentives. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   six months ended June 30, 2015   was   $(11.3) million  , as compared to a net cash provided by investing activities of   $7.4 million   for the   six months ended June 30, 2014  . The Company used   $18.9 million   to buy marketable securities and had proceeds of   $13.9 million   from the sale of marketable securities, and   $332,000   was used for capital expenditures, primarily to upgrade IT infrastructure, for the   six months ended June 30, 2015  .  
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $21.0 million   for the   six months ended June 30, 2015   compared to net cash used of   $(2.6) million   for the   six months ended June 30, 2014  . Through the issuance of common stock and warrants in a public offering consummated in March 2015, we raised net proceeds of approximately $17.7 million. The cash inflows were offset by $3.0 million held in collateral as restricted cash on our combined consolidated balance sheet.

Outstanding Warrants 
    
  On March 4, 2015 we raised proceeds of approximately $20.0 million through the sale of 6,667,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,667,000 shares of our common stock at a combined offering price of $3.00 in an underwritten public offering. The warrants have a per share exercise price of $3.75, are exercisable immediately and will expire five years from the date of issuance. We granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,000,050 shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,000,050 shares of common stock to cover additional over-allotments, if any. On March 4, 2015, the underwriters exercised a portion of their over-allotment option with respect to 113,200 warrants. In addition, 166,675 warrants were issued to the underwriters. The over-allotment option has expired as of the date of this filing. 
    
  The gross proceeds to us, including the underwriters' partial exercise of their over-allotment option, were approximately $20.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us. Assuming the exercise of all 6,667,000 warrants at the exercise price of $3.75 each, and assuming we maintain the conditions necessary for a cash exercise, the total additional gross aggregate proceeds to the Company would be approximately $25.0 million. However, there can be no assurance that any warrants will be exercised. 
    
  On May 6, 2014, we issued warrants to purchase up to 12,500 and 6,250 shares of our Common Stock in connection with exclusivity agreements. The warrants were exercisable commencing 75 days after their date of issuance, in whole or in part, until May 6, 2015 at an exercise price of $11.00 per share, representing the average closing price of our common stock for the ten days preceding the issuance. The fair value of the warrants on the date of issuance approximated $116,000. The warrants for 12,500 and 6,250 shares, respectively, expired in May 2015 and were not exercised. 
    
  On July 2, 2014, we issued a warrant exercisable for 50,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $12.80 per share in consideration of a two-year consulting agreement with an individual who has extensive experience in the direct-to-consumer industry. The warrant was exercisable for a ten day period commencing 720 days after issuance. In addition, the warrant provides for piggyback registration rights upon request, in certain cases. The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants was subject to adjustment in the event of a stock dividend or our recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. On July 22, 2015 we executed an extension on the consulting agreement through July of 2017 in exchange for cancellation of the original warrant for 50,000 shares and the issuance of a new warrant exercisable for 50,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.16 per share. The new warrant is also exercisable for a ten day period commencing 720 days after issuance. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net income/(loss) and affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, income taxes, and long-lived assets, have the greatest impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. 
    
  There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the   six months ended June 30, 2015  , as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Items 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was filed with the SEC on March 23, 2015, other than the purchase accounting performed on the acquisitions in 2015. This involves management's estimate of the fair value of the net assets of the company. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  See footnote (  1  ) of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. 
    
  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Company is occasionally involved in lawsuits and disputes arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, based upon advice of counsel, the likelihood of an adverse outcome against the Company is remote. As such, management believes that the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 
    
  Market Risk Sensitive Instruments 
    
  The market risk inherent in our market-risk-sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in investment market prices, foreign currency exchange-rates and interest rates. 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
    
  Revenue from customers outside of the United States represented approximately   62.3%   and   42.1%   of our total net revenues for the   six months ended June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. We expect that revenue from foreign customers will continue to represent an increasingly large percentage of our revenue. 
    
  Interest rate risk 
    
  Due to our financing, investing and cash-management activities, we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates. 
    
  We entered into a Credit Facility with HSBC Bank as of March 24, 2015 for the approximated amount of $3.0 million.  The Credit Facility bears a variable interest rate based on the Bank of England base rate plus 0.6%, and on June 30, 2015, the weighted average interest rate of the Credit Facility, including borrowings under the Term Loan, was 1.1%. The Credit Facility matures on March 24, 2017, unless earlier repurchased. Since our Credit Facility is based on variable interest rates, and as we have not entered into any new interest swap arrangements, if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1% for the year, and our borrowing amounts stayed constant on our Credit Facility, our annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $34,000. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  This Amended Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A includes the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ).  See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2.  This Item 4 includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in those certifications.   
    
  As a result of the material adjustments related to the annual audit for the year ended December 31, 2015, management identified material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting.  Those weaknesses identified were in existence during the quarter ended   June 30, 2015  .   
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls were not effective because of the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting described below. 
    
  Management has identified material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting relating to the following: 

Overall Control Environment 
     The Company has not maintained an effective control environment to provide reasonable assurance regarding achievement of relating to operations, reporting and compliance.  The Company has not complied with the requirement of the 2013 COSO Framework. 

Sufficient Accounting Personnel 
     The Company has not maintained sufficient accounting personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training commensurate with maintaining an effective control environment to meet the financial reporting requirements of a publicly traded company with international operations.  The result of the lack of sufficient accounting personnel has led to the following issues related to internal control over financial reporting: 
             
    Management estimates were not performed with the structure and rigor necessary to result in quality estimate that need for fairly presented financial information.

     Table of Contents  

Management missed a required Form 8-K/A filing requirement related to the acquisition of Kleeneze.  Subsequently, the filing was made 8 months later.  
                
    Management has made significant adjustments for material errors resulting from the review of the quarterly financial statements. 
                
    Management has made significant adjustments for material errors resulting from the audit of the annual financial statements.  
                
    Management has made significant disclosure remediation and adjustments to the financial statements resulting from the quarterly review and annual audits.     
                
    The Company has incurred substantial delays in completing its audit and filing with the SEC of its 2015 Form 10-K, this Quarterly Report, and its June Form 10-Q. 
                
    The Company has incurred breaches to covenants to its debt agreements due to the delays in missing its filing requirements.  

Consolidation Process 
     The Company does not have effective controls to ensure the consolidation of all its subsidiaries is performed correctly.  The consolidation is performed and reviewed by one employee.  There are no controls to ensure all financial data of the subsidiaries are being compiled correctly, no review to ensure the employee is consolidating correctly and no controls to ensure all accounts being appropriately converted and consolidated in the financial statements.   

Account Reconciliation 
     The Company did not maintain effective controls over the reconciliation of many of its accounts and the timely preparation and review of the financial statements or information.  The has resulted in a significant amount of reconciliations being performed as part of the audit process.  These reconciliations have resulted in significant audit adjustments.  Additionally, there is no formal review and approval of reconciliations performed by the accounting personnel.   

Deferred Revenue and Revenue 
     The Company did not maintain control over its recording of deferred revenue and revenue in its sales process.  This has resulted in significant adjustments to the financial statements.  

Inventory Management 
     Certain companies within the Company accepts its inventory upon the shipment of products (FOB Shipping Point).  However, the Company does not account for the receipt of inventory until it has been received.  Accordingly, the Company does not maintain appropriate controls around its inventory management system.   

Journal Entry Support  
     The Company did not maintain effective controls over the approval, recording and retention of journal entries and their supporting detail.  The Company did not maintain effective monitoring controls to ensure that journal entries were being properly prepared with sufficient supporting documentation or were reviewed and approved to ensure accuracy and completeness of the journal entries.   

Complex Accounting Issues 
     The Company did not design an effective control environment to address complex accounting issues.  The lack of qualified accounting personnel led to deficiencies in identifying complex accounting issues and resulting in material adjustments to the financial statement in both the quarterly and year-end filings. 

Segregation of Duties 
     The Company has not maintained appropriate segregation of duties throughout the internal control over financial reporting process.  The Company has numerous instances where review an approval is performed by the same employee negating any monitoring or approval controls.  

IT System Conversion Controls 
     The Company did not develop a process to appropriately control the ERP system conversion at one of its subsidiaries.   

IT Control Environment 
     The Company does not maintain the appropriate level of controls over the ability to access its ERP systems.  The lack of control could result in the in inappropriate approval of journal entries, inappropriate approval of expenditures, and inappropriate access to the general ledger.

During the fiscal quarter ended   June 30, 2015  , no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) took place during the fiscal quarter ended   June 30, 2015  , that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Management s Remediation Initiatives 
    
  Management emphasizes that our stated growth strategy is to acquire companies. In some cases, the companies acquired may not have invested in adequate systems or staffing to meet public company financial reporting standards. The Company reviews the financial reporting and other systems that each company has and, in many cases, especially in the case of private companies, the financial systems that are in place may not be as robust as needed. In addition, the rapid pace of our acquisitions means the Company has acquired companies that currently operate on a variety of systems, which makes standardization more difficult. Because of this, the Company purchased and plan the implementation of a common enterprise resource planning system across all our companies. The Company believes this will allow for a common set of processes and controls to enable accurate financial information, easier comparison across companies and quicker consolidations. TLC, in February of 2015, was the first company to transition on to the new platform. 
    
  In addition, our objective is to centralize accounting and treasury, rather than having such activities performed at each subsidiary. This will provide a current and long-term benefit of having the required internal controls performed in a centralized controlled location, so that review and remediation can occur quickly. This effort means that the Company must continue to hire sufficient accounting personnel to properly process and control transactions and timely prepare our financial statements. 
    
  Finally, the Company seeks to build out a more traditional financial and accounting hierarchy which will be key to the centralization and streamlining of accounting and treasury functions. The Company expects to continue to improve on this goal and that when combined with the other initiatives, should result in a robust control environment in financial reporting, a financial reporting process that is capable of providing management with timely and accurate information and in-turn be able to comply timely with SEC filing requirements.  
    
  Limitations of the Effectiveness 
    
  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors or all instances of fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitation of a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II. Other Information  

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings 
    
  There have been no significant changes to our legal proceedings from those included in Part I Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was filed with the SEC on March 23, 2015. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  You should carefully consider the following risks in evaluating our Company and our business. The risks described below are the risks that we currently believe are material to our business. However, additional risks not presently known to us, or risks that we currently believe are not material, may also impair our business operations. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this report, including the information set forth in  Business  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  as well as our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the following risks. If we are adversely affected by such risks, then the market price of our common stock could decline. 
    
  Risks Relating To Our Business 
    
  We have suffered operating losses since inception and we may not be able to achieve profitability. 
    
  We had an accumulated deficit of   $(39.3) million   as of   June 30, 2015   and   $(32.2) million   as of   December 31, 2014   and we expect to continue to incur increasing expenses in the foreseeable future related to our long-term growth strategy to develop a large, diverse global company in the micro-enterprise sector. As a result, we are sustaining operating and net losses, and it is possible that we will never be able to achieve or sustain the revenue levels necessary to attain profitability. 
    
  Because we have recently acquired a large number of businesses, it is difficult to predict if we will continue to generate our current level of revenue. 
    
  Prior to March 2013, our primary business was publishing a monthly magazine, Happenings Magazine, and prior to September 2012, we were engaged in the development and commercialization of medical devices. Between March of 2013 and the date of this filing, we completed nine business acquisitions, changing our business focus away from that of the publishing business and medical devices business towards the direct-to-consumer business. It is too early to predict whether consumers will accept, and continue to use, on a regular basis, the products generated by the companies we acquired in these recent acquisitions or the direct-to-consumer companies we hope to acquire in the future. We have had a very limited operating history as a combined entity and the impact of our recent acquisitions is difficult to assess. Therefore, our ability to sustain our current revenue is uncertain and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to generate significant revenue or be profitable. 
    
  We rely upon our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations to fund our business and if our cash flow from operations is inadequate, we will need to continue to raise capital through a debt or equity financing, if available, or curtail operations. 
    
  The adequacy of our cash resources to continue to meet our future operational needs depends, in large part, on our ability to increase product sales and/or reduce operating costs. If we are unsuccessful in generating positive cash flow from operations, we could exhaust our available cash resources and be required to secure additional funding through a debt or equity financing such as the Offering, significantly scale back our operations, and/or discontinue many of our activities which could negatively affect our business and prospects. Additional funding may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms. 
    
  Any failure to meet our debt service obligations, or to refinance or repay our outstanding indebtedness as it matures, could materially adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations and repay or refinance our maturing indebtedness will depend principally upon our future operating performance. We are required to make monthly payments under our promissory notes that mature on October 22, 2018 and February 14, 2023 that have principal balances of   $1.2 million   and   $3.2 million  , respectively as of   June 30, 2015  . We also are required to make monthly interest payments on senior secured debt owed to HSBC Bank PLC as part of our acquisition of Kleeneze. The debt owed to HSBC had a balance of   $3.1 million   as of   June 30, 2015   and is fully secured by cash shown on our consolidated balance sheet under the restricted cash line as part of non-current assets. As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, incurring additional  
  
   41 

     Table of Contents  

debt, issuing equity or convertible securities, reducing discretionary expenditures and selling certain assets (or combinations thereof). Our ability to execute such alternative financing plans will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, our ability to execute such alternative financing plans may be subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants compared to those associated with any debt that is being refinanced, which could further restrict our business operations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or our inability to refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  Our investments in marketable securities are subject to market risks, which may result in losses. 
    
  As of   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , we had approximately   $6.0 million   and   $1.0 million   in marketable securities, respectively, invested primarily in a diversified portfolio of liquid bonds. At neither   June 30, 2015   nor   December 31, 2014   did we have any investments in equity securities. However, we have from time to time and may in the future invest in equity securities. During the   six months ended June 30, 2015  , we realized a gain on marketable securities of   $192,000  . These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 
    
  We may be unsuccessful in integrating the business operations of our recently acquired subsidiaries Kleeneze and Betterware with ours, which, if it were to occur, would negatively impact our growth strategy. 
    
  There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the integration of Kleeneze s business operations following our recent acquisition acquisition, the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. Our primary growth strategy is based on increasing our acquisitions of, or entering into strategic transactions with direct selling companies, and potentially companies engaged in other direct selling related businesses. The integration of the Kleeneze transaction may include the following challenges: 

assimilating Kleeneze and Betterware's business operations, products and personnel with our existing operations, products and personnel; 
                
    estimating the capital, personnel and equipment required for Kleenezs and Betterware's business based on the historical experience of management; 
                
    minimizing potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with other suppliers and customers; 
                
    successfully developing and marketing Kleeneze and Betterware's products and services; 
                
    entering a market in which we have limited prior experience; and 
                
    coordinating our efforts throughout various distant localities and time zones, such as the United Kingdom where Kleeneze and Betterware are based. 
       
  Our growth strategy, as well as the business of Kleeneze, will be subject to many of the risks common to new enterprises, including the ability to implement a business plan, market acceptance of proposed products and services, under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financing and other resources, competition from better funded and experienced companies, and the ability to generate profits. In light of the stage of our development, no assurance can be given that we will be able to consummate our business strategy and plans, that our activities will be successful or that financial, technological, market, or other limitations will not force us to modify, alter, significantly delay, or significantly impede the implementation of our plans. 
    
  Our business is difficult to evaluate because we have recently expanded, and intend to continue to expand, our product offerings and customer base. 
    
  Although our business has grown rapidly, we are still in the early stages of the implementation of our primary growth strategy, which is to increase our acquisitions of, and our number of strategic transactions with, other direct-to-consumer companies, such as the recent Kleeneze acquisition and potentially companies engaged in other direct-to-consumer related businesses. As such, it may be difficult for investors to analyze our results of operations, to identify historical trends or even to make quarter-to-quarter comparisons because we have operated many of these newly-acquired businesses for a relatively limited time and intend to continue to expand our product offerings. Our growth strategy, as well as each business we acquire, is subject to many of the risks common to new enterprises, including the ability to implement a business plan, market acceptance of proposed products and services, under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financing and other resources, competition from better funded and experienced companies, and the ability to generate profits. In light of the stage of our development, no assurance can be given that we will be able to consummate our business strategy and plans, as described herein, that our activities will be successful or that financial, technological, market, or other limitations will not force us to modify, alter, significantly delay, or significantly impede the implementation of our plans. 

42 

     Table of Contents  

We may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates which may negatively impact our growth strategy. 
    
  There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition candidates or consummate future acquisitions or strategic transactions on acceptable terms. Our failure to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate future acquisitions or strategic transactions on acceptable terms could have an adverse effect on our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and stock price as our primary growth strategy is based on increasing our acquisitions of, or entering into strategic transactions with direct selling companies, and potentially companies engaged in other direct-to-consumer related businesses. We are continually evaluating acquisition opportunities available to us that we believe will fit our acquisition strategy, namely companies that can increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer us growth and operating efficiency opportunities. 
    
  We may seek to finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships which may dilute the interests of our shareholders. 
    
  The financing for future acquisitions could dilute the interests of our shareholders, result in an increase in our indebtedness, or both. The issuance of our common stock in the offering completed in March 2015 (the "Offering") resulted in dilution to existing shareholders and the issuance of additional shares of common stock and/or Warrants pursuant to the Underwriter s over-allotment option as well as the exercise of any Warrants issued in the Offering will result in additional dilution to current shareholders. In addition, an acquisition or other strategic transaction could adversely impact our cash flows and/or operating results, and dilute shareholder interests, for a number of reasons, including: 

interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition or new business venture; and 
                
    any issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or other strategic transaction which dilutes the current holders of our common stock. 
       
  We may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses we have recently acquired and may acquire in the future with our current management and structure. 
    
  Our failure to successfully complete the integration of the businesses we acquire could have an adverse effect on our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. The larger the business we acquire, the larger we believe our integration challenge will be. Integration challenges may include the following:  

assimilating the acquired business  operations products and personnel with our existing operations, products and personnel; 
                
    estimating the capital, personnel and equipment required for the acquired businesses based on the historical experience of management with the businesses they are familiar with; 
                
    minimizing potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with other suppliers and customers; 
                
    successfully developing and marketing the new products and services; 
                
    entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and 
                
    coordinating our efforts throughout various distant localities and time zones, such as Italy, the United Kingdom and Australia, currently. 
       
  The diversion of management s attention and costs associated with acquisitions may have a negative impact on our business. 
    
  If management s attention is diverted from the management of our existing businesses as a result of its efforts in evaluating and negotiating new acquisitions and strategic transactions, the prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations of our existing businesses may suffer. We also may incur unanticipated costs in connection with pursuing acquisitions and strategic transactions. 
    
  Acquisitions may subject us to additional unknown risks which may affect our customer retention and cause a reduction in our revenues. 
    
  In completing prior acquisitions and any future acquisitions, including our recently acquired subsidiary Kleeneze, we have and will rely upon the representations and warranties and indemnities made by the sellers with respect to each such acquisition as well as our own due diligence investigation. We cannot assure you that such representations and warranties will be true and correct or that our due diligence will uncover all materially adverse facts relating to the operations and financial condition of the acquired companies or their customers. To the extent that we are required to pay the debt obligations of an acquired company, or if material misrepresentations exist, we may not realize the expected benefit from such acquisition and we will have overpaid in cash and/or stock for the value received in that acquisition.

We may have difficulty managing future growth. 
    
  Since we commenced operations in the direct-to-consumer business, our business has grown significantly. This growth has placed substantial strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources. There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to John P. Rochon s and John Rochon, Jr. s ownership and control of our company or that any conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to the other shareholders of our company. On December 1, 2014, the Amended Share Exchange Agreement became effective, which limits Rochon Capital s right to be issued the Second Tranche Stock solely upon the occurrence of certain stock acquisitions by third parties or the announcement of certain tender or exchange offers of our common stock. See  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence  in the Company's Form 10-K/A. Upon the issuance of the shares sold in the Offering completed on March 4, 2015, John P. Rochon, together with John Rochon, Jr., control approximately 58.2% of the voting power of our outstanding securities. In the event that the Second Tranche Stock is issued, John P. Rochon, together with John Rochon, Jr., will control approximately 75.9% of the voting power of our outstanding securities. 
    
  Furthermore, the issuance of the Second Tranche Stock in accordance with the terms of the Amended Share Exchange Agreement would have a further dilutive effect. 
    
  Assuming the issuance of the Second Tranche Stock occurs, the number of outstanding shares of our common stock would increase to in excess of 60,000,000, with approximately 190,000,000 shares of our common stock available for issuance and John P. Rochon, together with John Rochon, Jr., would beneficially own approximately 75.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In the event the Second Tranche Stock becomes issuable, 25,240,676 additional shares of common stock will be issued. The perception that such further dilution could occur may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 
    
  We depend heavily on John P. Rochon, and we may be unable to find a suitable replacement for Mr. Rochon if we were to lose his services. 
    
  We are heavily dependent upon John P. Rochon, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board. The loss or unavailability of Mr. Rochon could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition, results from operations and stock price. 
    
  We are dependent upon affiliated parties for the provisions of a substantial portion of our administrative services as we do not have the internal capabilities to provide such services, and many of our employees are also employees of such affiliated entities. 
    
  We utilize the services of Richmont Holdings, Inc. ( Richmont Holdings ), a private investment and business management company owned 100% by John P. Rochon, under a reimbursement of services agreement pursuant to which Richmont Holdings provides transactions and administrative services to us. The Company has entered into an agreement with Richmont Holdings to reimburse Richmont Holdings for certain expenses incurred by us in connection with our use of its office space, access to its office equipment, access to certain of its personnel, financial analysis personnel, strategy assistance, marketing advice and assorted other services related to our day-to-day operations and our efforts to acquire direct-to-consumer companies. We continue to rely upon Richmont Holdings for advice and assistance in areas related to identification, analysis, financing, due diligence, negotiations and other strategic planning, accounting, tax and legal matters associated with potential acquisitions. Richmont Holdings and its affiliates have experience in the above areas. There can be no assurance that we can successfully develop the necessary expertise and infrastructure on our own without the assistance of these affiliated entities. 
    
  Certain of our subsidiaries are dependent on their key personnel. 
    
  The loss of the key executive officers of certain of our subsidiaries would have a significant adverse effect on the operations of the affected subsidiary and its prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. Although major decision making policies are handled by the Company s senior management, certain subsidiaries are primarily dependent upon their founder and/or Chief Executive Officer for their leadership roles with the respective sales forces. For instance, YIAH is particularly dependent upon its Colleen Walters, its Chief Executive Officer and founder, who represent the YIAH brand to her sales force. The loss of this individual could have a negative impact on sales field recruiting and sales, which ultimately would impact our revenue. We believe it is critical to retain key leaders of certain of the businesses we acquire, however there can be no assurance that any business or company acquired by us will be successful in attracting and retaining its key personnel.

We experience a high level of competition for qualified representatives in the direct selling industry and the loss of key high-level independent sales representatives could negatively impact our growth and our revenue. 
    
  As of December 31, 2014, we had over 47,000 active independent sales representatives, of which more than 600 were at the highest level under our various compensation plans. These independent sales leaders are important in maintaining and growing our revenue. As a result, the loss of a high-level independent sales representative or a group of leading representatives could negatively impact our growth and our revenue. 
    
  In the direct-to-consumer industry, sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through independent sales representatives. Generally, there can be a high rate of turnover among a direct-to-consumer company s independent sales representatives. Our independent sales representatives may terminate their service at any time. 
    
  Our ability to remain competitive and maintain and expand our business depends, in significant part, on the success of our subsidiaries in recruiting, retaining, and incentivizing their independent sales representatives through an appropriate compensation plan, the maintenance of an attractive product portfolio and other incentives, and innovating the direct-to-consumer model. We cannot ensure that our strategies for soliciting and retaining the representatives of our subsidiaries or any direct-to-consumer company we acquire in the future will be successful, and if they are not, our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and stock price could be harmed. 
    
  Several factors affect our ability to attract and retain independent sales representatives, including: 

on-going motivation of our independent sales representatives; 
                
    general economic conditions; 
                
    significant changes in the amount of commissions paid; 
                
    public perception and acceptance of the industry, our business and our products; 
                
    our ability to provide proprietary quality-driven products that the market demands; and 
                
    competition in recruiting and retaining independent sales representatives. 
       
  Changes to our compensation arrangements could be viewed negatively by some independent sales representatives and could cause failure to achieve desired long-term results and increases in commissions paid could have a negative impact on profitability. 
    
  The payment of commissions and incentives, including bonuses and prizes, is one of our most significant expenses. We closely monitor the amount of the commissions and incentives we pay as a percentage of net revenues, and may periodically adjust our compensation plan to better manage these costs. 
    
  We modify components of our compensation plans from time to time in an attempt to remain competitive and attractive to existing and potential independent sales representatives including modifications to: 

address changing market dynamics; 
                
    provide incentives to independent sales representatives that are intended to help grow our business; 
                
    conform to local regulations; and 
                
    address other business needs. 
       
  Because of the size of our sales force and the complexity of our compensation plans, it is difficult to predict how independent sales representatives will view such changes and whether such changes will achieve their desired results. Furthermore, any downward adjustments to commissions and incentives may make it difficult to attract and retain our independent sales representatives or cause us to lose some of our existing independent sales representatives. There can be no assurance that changes to our compensation plans will be successful in achieving target levels of commissions and incentives as a percentage of net revenues and preventing these costs from having a significant adverse effect on our earnings. 
    
  Our business operates in an industry with intense competition. 
    
  Our business operates in an industry with numerous manufacturers, distributors and retailers of consumer goods. The market for our products is intensely competitive. Many of our competitors, such as Avon Products Inc., Tupperware Brands Corp. and others are significantly larger, have greater financial resources, and have better name recognition than we do. We also rely on our independent sales representatives to market and sell our products through direct marketing techniques. Our ability to compete with other direct marketing companies depends greatly on our ability to attract and retain qualified independent sales representatives. In addition, we currently do not have significant patent or other proprietary protection, and our competitors may introduce products  
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

with the same or similar ingredients that we use in our products. As a result, we may have difficulty differentiating our products from our competitors  products and other competing products that enter the market. There can be no assurance that our future operations would not be harmed as a result of changing market conditions and future competition. 
    
  We and our subsidiaries generally conduct business in one channel. 
    
  Our principal business is conducted worldwide in one channel, the direct-to-consumer channel. Products and services of direct-to-consumer companies are sold to retail consumers. Spending by retail consumers is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, gasoline prices, labor strikes and consumer confidence, all of which are beyond our control. Our subsidiaries may face economic challenges because customers may continue to have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit and falling home prices, among other things. 
    
  Changes in consumer purchasing habits, including reducing purchases of a direct-to-consumer company s products, or reducing purchases from representatives or buying products in channels other than direct-to-consumer, such as retail, could reduce our sales, impact our ability to execute our business strategy or have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations. 
    
  Direct-to-consumer companies are subject to numerous laws. 
    
  The direct-to-consumer industry is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the Federal Trade Commission (the  FTC ) and various state agencies in the United States, as well as regulations regarding direct-to-consumer activities in foreign markets. Laws specifically applicable to direct-to-consumer companies generally are directed at preventing deceptive or misleading marketing and sales practices, and include laws often referred to as  pyramid  or  chain sales  scheme laws. These  anti-pyramid  laws are focused on ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to end consumers and that advancement within a sales organization is based on sales of products and services rather than investments in the organization, recruiting other participants, or other non-retail sales-related criteria. The regulatory requirements concerning direct-to-consumer programs involve a high level of subjectivity and are subject to judicial interpretation. We and our subsidiaries are subject to the risk that these laws or regulations or the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by governmental agencies or courts can change. Any direct-to-consumer company that we own or we acquire in the future, could be found not to be in compliance with current or newly adopted laws or regulations in one or more markets, which could prevent us from conducting our business in these markets and harm our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. We are aware of pending judicial actions and investigations against other companies in the direct-to-consumer industry. Adverse decisions in these cases could impact our business if direct-to-consumer laws or anti-pyramid laws are interpreted more narrowly or in a manner that results in additional burdens or restrictions on direct selling. The implementation of such regulations may be influenced by public attention directed toward a direct-to-consumer company, its products or its direct-to-consumer program, such that extensive adverse publicity could result in increased regulatory scrutiny. If any government were to ban or restrict our business model, our prospects, business activities, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
    
  We are subject to numerous government regulations. 
    
  Our products and related promotional and marketing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation by numerous governmental agencies and authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration (the  FDA ), the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Agriculture, State Attorney Generals and other state regulatory agencies in the United States, and similar government agencies in each market in which we operate. Government authorities regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy and benefits of our products. These regulatory authorities typically require adequate and reliable scientific substantiation to support any marketing claims. What constitutes such reliable scientific substantiation can vary widely from market to market and there is no assurance that the research and development efforts that we undertake to support our claims will be deemed adequate for any particular product or claim. If we are unable to show adequate and reliable scientific substantiation for our product claims, or our marketing materials or the marketing materials of our sales force make claims that exceed the scope of allowed claims for spices, dietary supplements or skin care products that we offer, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could take enforcement action requiring us to revise our marketing materials, amend our claims or stop selling certain products, which could harm our business. 
    
  For example, the FDA recently issued warning letters to several cosmetic companies alleging improper structure/function claims regarding their cosmetic products, including, for example, product claims regarding gene activity, cellular rejuvenation, and rebuilding collagen. There is a degree of subjectivity in determining whether a claim is an improper structure/function claim. Given this subjectivity and our research and development focus on skin care products and dietary supplements, there is a risk that  
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

we could receive a warning letter, be required to modify our product claims or take other actions to satisfy the FDA if the FDA determines any of our marketing materials include improper structure/function claims for our cosmetic products. In addition, plaintiffs  lawyers have filed class action lawsuits against some of our competitors after our competitors received these FDA warning letters. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to governmental actions or class action lawsuits, which could harm our business. 
    
  There are an increasing number of laws and regulations being promulgated by the U.S. government, governments of individual states and governments overseas that pertain to the Internet and doing business online. In addition, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal, state, local, and foreign governments and agencies. 
    
  As a U.S. entity operating through subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions, we are subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing and customs laws that regulate the flow of funds between us and our subsidiaries and for product purchases, management services and contractual obligations, such as the payment of sales commissions. 
    
  The failure of the representatives of our subsidiaries to comply with laws, regulations and court decisions creates potential exposure for regulatory action or lawsuits against us. 
    
  Because the representatives that market and sell our products and services are independent contractors, and not employees, we and our subsidiaries have limited control over their actions. In the United States, the direct-to-consumer industry and regulatory authorities have generally relied on the implementation of a company s rules and policies governing its direct-to-consumer sales field, designed to promote retail sales, protect consumers, prevent inappropriate activities and distinguish between legitimate direct-to-consumer plans and unlawful pyramid schemes, to compel compliance with applicable laws. We maintain formal compliance measures to identify specific complaints against our representatives and to remedy any violations through appropriate sanctions, including warnings, suspensions and, when necessary, terminations. Because of the significant number of representatives our subsidiaries have, it is not feasible for our subsidiaries to monitor the representatives  day-to-day business activities. We and our subsidiaries must maintain the  independent contractor  status of our representatives and, therefore, have limited control over their business activities. As a result, we cannot insure that our representatives will comply with all applicable rules and regulations, domestically or globally. Violations by our representatives of applicable laws or of our policies and procedures in dealing with customers could reflect negatively on our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, including our business reputation, and could subject us to fines and penalties. In addition, it is possible that a court could hold us civilly or criminally accountable based on vicarious liability because of the actions of our representatives. 
    
  Although the physical labeling of our products is not within the control of our representatives, our representatives must nevertheless advertise our products in compliance with the extensive regulations that exist in certain jurisdictions, such as the United States, which considers product advertising to be labeling for regulatory purposes. 
    
  Our foods, nutritional supplements and skin care products are subject to rigorous FDA and related legal regimens limiting the types of therapeutic claims that can be made about our products. The treatment or cure of disease, for example, is not a permitted claim for these products. While we train our independent sales representatives and attempt to monitor our sales representatives  marketing materials, we cannot ensure that all such materials comply with applicable regulations, including bans on therapeutic claims. If our independent sales representatives fail to comply with these restrictions, then we and our independent sales representatives could be subjected to claims, financial penalties, mandatory product recalls or relabeling requirements, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Although we expect that our responsibility for the actions of our independent sales representatives in such an instance would be dependent on a determination that we either controlled or condoned a noncompliant advertising practice, there can be no assurance that we could not be held vicariously liable for the actions of our independent sales representatives. 
    
  Our operations could be harmed if we are found not to be in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices. 
    
  In the United States, FDA regulations on Good Manufacturing Practices and Adverse Event Reporting requirements for the nutritional supplement industry require us and our vendors to maintain good manufacturing processes, including stringent vendor qualifications, ingredient identification, manufacturing controls and record keeping. The ingredient identification requirement, which requires us to confirm the levels, identity and potency of ingredients listed on our product labels within a narrow range, is particularly burdensome and difficult for us with respect to our cosmetic products which contains many different ingredients. We are also required to report serious adverse events associated with consumer use of our products. Our operations could be harmed if regulatory authorities make determinations that we, or our vendors, are not in compliance with these regulations or public reporting of adverse events harms our reputation for quality and safety. A finding of noncompliance may result in administrative warnings, penalties or actions impacting our ability to continue selling certain products. In addition, compliance with these  
  
   47 

     Table of Contents  

regulations has increased and may further increase the cost of manufacturing certain of our products as we work with our vendors to assure they are qualified and in compliance. 
    
  Adverse publicity associated with our products, ingredients or network marketing program, or those of similar companies could harm our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Our number of representatives and the results of our operations may be affected significantly by the public s perception of our subsidiaries and of similar companies. This perception is dependent upon opinions concerning: 

the safety and quality of our products, components and ingredients, as applicable; 
                
    the safety and quality of similar products, components and ingredients, as applicable, distributed by other companies  representatives; 
                
    our marketing program; and 
                
    the business of direct-to-consumer companies generally. 
       
  Adverse publicity concerning any actual or purported failure of our subsidiaries or of their representatives to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding product claims and advertising, good manufacturing practices, the regulation of our marketing program, the licensing of our products for sale in our target markets or other aspects of our business, whether or not resulting in enforcement actions or the imposition of penalties, could have an adverse effect on our goodwill and could negatively affect the ability to attract, motivate and retain representatives, which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue. 
    
  If we are unable to develop and introduce new products that gain acceptance from our customers and representatives, our business could be harmed. 
    
  Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, evaluate, and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences. We must continually work to discover and market new products, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products. A critical component of our business is our ability to develop new products that create enthusiasm among our independent sales representatives and ultimate customers. If we are unable to introduce new products, our independent sales representatives  productivity could be harmed. In addition, if any new products fail to gain market acceptance, are restricted by regulatory requirements or have quality problems, this would harm our results of operations. Factors that could affect our ability to continue to introduce new products include, among others, government regulations, the inability to attract and retain qualified research and development staff, the termination of third-party research and collaborative arrangements, proprietary protections of competitors that may limit our ability to offer comparable products, and the difficulties in anticipating changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences. 
    
  A general economic downturn, a recession globally or in one or more of our geographic regions or other challenges may adversely affect our business and our access to liquidity and capital. 
    
  A downturn in the economies in which we sell our products, including any recession in one or more of our geographic regions, or the current global macro-economic pressures, could adversely affect our business and our access to liquidity and capital. We could experience a decline in revenues, profitability and cash flow due to reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by economic or operational challenges. Any or all of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to raise additional capital and maintain credit lines and offshore cash balances. 
    
  Consumer spending is also generally affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, gasoline prices and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, such as beauty and related products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products. We could face continued economic challenges in the current fiscal year if customers continue to have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit or sharply falling home prices, among other things. 
    
  Nutritional supplement products may be supported by only limited availability of conclusive clinical studies. 
    
  Some of the nutritional supplements we offer are made from vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption. Other nutritional supplements we offer contain innovative ingredients. Although we believe that all of our products are safe when taken as directed, there is little long-term experience with human consumption of certain of these ingredients or combinations of ingredients in concentrated form. We conduct research and test the formulation and production  
  
   48 

     Table of Contents  

of our products, but we have not performed or sponsored any clinical studies. Furthermore, because we are highly dependent on consumers  perception of the efficacy, safety, and quality of our products, as well as similar products distributed by other companies, we could be adversely affected in the event that these products prove or are asserted to be ineffective or harmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with any illness or other adverse effects resulting from consumers  use or misuse of our products or similar products of our competitors. 
    
  We frequently rely on outside suppliers and manufacturers, and if those suppliers and manufactures fail to supply products in sufficient quantities and in a timely fashion, our business could suffer. 
    
  We depend on outside suppliers for raw materials and finished goods. We also may use outside manufacturers to make all or part of our products. Our profit margins and timely product delivery may be dependent upon the ability of our outside suppliers and manufacturers to supply us with products in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Our contract manufacturers acquire all of the raw materials for manufacturing our products from third-party suppliers. We do not believe we are materially dependent on any single supplier for raw materials or finished goods, with the exception of Innovative FlexPak, LLC, which produces a substantial portion of Agel s finished goods. We believe that there are other suppliers who could produce these products for Agel, if necessary; however, transitioning to other suppliers could result in delays or additional expense. In order to mitigate this risk, Agel has developed relationships with two additional suppliers and has begun diversifying the source of its finished goods. In the event we were to lose any significant suppliers and experience delays in identifying or transitioning to alternative suppliers, we could experience product shortages or product back orders, which could harm our business. There can be no assurance that suppliers will be able to provide our contract manufacturers the raw materials or finished goods in the quantities and at the appropriate level of quality that we request or at a price that we are willing to pay. We are also subject to delays caused by any interruption in the production of these materials including weather, crop conditions, climate change, transportation interruptions and natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Our ability to enter new markets and sustain satisfactory levels of sales in each market may depend on the ability of our outside suppliers and manufacturers to provide required levels of ingredients and products and to comply with all applicable regulations. 
    
  We are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturers and suppliers of products. Those operations are subject to power failures, the breakdown, failure, or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, natural or other disasters, and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies, including the FDA. There can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facilities would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
    
  Disruptions to transportation channels that we use to distribute our products to international warehouses may adversely affect our margins and profitability in those markets. 
    
  We may experience disruptions to the transportation channels used to distribute our products, including increased airport and shipping port congestion, a lack of transportation capacity, increased fuel expenses, and a shortage of manpower. Disruptions in our container shipments may result in increased costs, including the additional use of airfreight to meet demand. Although we have not recently experienced significant shipping disruptions, we continue to watch for signs of upcoming congestion. Congestion to ports can affect previously negotiated contracts with shipping companies, resulting in unexpected increases in shipping costs and reduction in our profitability. 
    
  A failure of our information technology systems would harm our business. 
    
  Our IT systems are vulnerable to a variety of potential risks, including damage or interruption resulting from natural disasters, telecommunication failures, and human error or intentional acts of sabotage, vandalism, break-ins and similar acts. Although we have adopted and implemented a business continuity and disaster recovery plan, which includes routine back-up, off-site archiving and storage, and certain redundancies, the occurrence of any of these events could result in costly interruptions or failures adversely affecting our business and the results of our operations. 
    
  Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches. 
    
  Our businesses involve the storage and transmission of users  proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. An increasing number of websites, including those of several large companies, have recently disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their sites. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers  proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers  
  
   49 

     Table of Contents  

or those of our customers, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. 
    
  Our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins,  denial-of-service  type attacks and similar disruptions that could, in certain instances, make all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. These issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate. Security breaches, including any breach by us or by parties with which we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of our users  personal information, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance policies carry coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. 
    
  Our web customers, as well as those of other prominent companies, may be targeted by parties using fraudulent  spoof  and  phishing  emails to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through  trojan horse  programs to our customers  computers. These emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by us, but they may direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program. Despite our efforts to mitigate  spoof  and  phishing  emails through product improvements and user education,  spoof  and  phishing  emails remain a serious problem that may damage our brands, discourage use of our websites, and increase our costs. 
    
  Our ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks. 
    
  Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is exposed to risks associated with our international operations, including: 

the possibility that a foreign government might ban or severely restrict our business method of direct selling, or that local civil unrest, political instability or changes in diplomatic or trade relationships might disrupt our operations in an international market; 
                
    the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas where we operate; 
                
    the presence of high inflation in the economies of international markets in which we operate; 
                
    the possibility that a government authority might impose legal, tax or other financial burdens on us or our sales force, due, for example, to the structure of our operations in various markets; 
                
    the possibility that a government authority might challenge the status of our sales force as independent contractors or impose employment or social taxes on our sales force; and 
                
    the possibility that governments may impose currency remittance restrictions limiting our ability to repatriate cash. 
       
  Currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce our overall profits. 
    
  During the   six months ended June 30, 2015  ,   62.3%   of our revenues were derived from markets outside of the United States. In   2014  ,   42.1%   of our revenues were derived from markets outside of the United States. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, certain financial information is required to be translated from foreign currencies to the United States dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted-average exchange rate. If the United States dollar changes relative to applicable local currencies, there is a risk our reported sales, operating expenses, and net income could significantly fluctuate. We are not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations, nor can we estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon our future operations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging contracts or participated in any hedging or derivative activities. 
    
  Taxation and transfer pricing affect our operations and we could be subjected to additional taxes, duties, interest, and penalties in material amounts, which could harm our business. 
    
  As a multinational corporation, in many countries, including the United States, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that our intercompany transactions are consummated at prices that have not been manipulated to produce a desired tax result, that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by the local entities, and that we are taxed appropriately on such transactions. Regulators closely monitor our corporate structure, intercompany transactions, and how we effectuate intercompany fund transfers. If regulators challenge our corporate structure, transfer pricing methodologies or intercompany transfers, our operations may be harmed and our effective tax rate may increase. 
    
  A change in applicable tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could be significant to our financial results. In the event any audit or assessments are concluded adversely to us, these matters could have a material impact on our financial condition. 
  
   50 

     Table of Contents  

Non-compliance with anti-corruption laws could harm our business. 
    
  Our international operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the  FCPA ). Any allegations that we are not in compliance with anti-corruption laws may require us to dedicate time and resources to an internal investigation of the allegations or may result in a government investigation. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing anti-corruption laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, and other penalties. Although we have implemented anti-corruption policies, controls and training globally to protect against violation of these laws, we cannot be certain that these efforts will be effective. We are aware that one of our competitors is under investigation in the United States for allegations that its employees violated the FCPA in China and other markets. If this investigation causes adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of our industry, our business could be harmed. 
    
  We may own, obtain or license intellectual property material to our business, and our ability to compete may be adversely affected by the loss of rights to use that intellectual property. 
    
  The market for our products may depend significantly upon the value associated with product innovations and our brand equity. Many direct sellers own, obtain or license material patents and trademarks used in connection with the marketing and distribution of their products. Those companies must expend time and resources in developing their intellectual property and pursuing any infringers of that intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect a company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect a company s patents and trademarks may be substantial. 
    
  Challenges by private parties to the direct-to-consumer system could harm our business. 
    
  Direct-to-consumer companies have historically been subject to legal challenges regarding their method of operation or other elements of their business by private parties, including their own representatives, in individual lawsuits and through class actions, including lawsuits claiming the operation of illegal pyramid schemes that reward recruiting over sales. We can provide no assurance that we would not be harmed if any such actions were brought against any of our current subsidiaries or any other direct selling company we may acquire in the future. 
    
  As a direct-to-consumer company, we may face product liability claims and could incur damages and expenses, which could affect our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  As a direct-to-consumer company we may face financial liability from product liability claims if the use of our products results in significant loss or injury. A substantial product liability claim could exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or could be excluded under the terms of our existing insurance policy, which could adversely affect our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Selling products for human consumption such as nutritional supplements and spices as well as the sale of skin care products involve a number of risks. We may need to recall some of our products if they become contaminated, are tampered with or are mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. 
    
  If we fail to protect our trademarks and tradenames, then our ability to compete could be negatively affected, which would harm our financial condition and operating results. 
    
  The market for our products depends upon the goodwill associated with our trademarks and tradenames. We own, or have licenses to use, the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our products in the majority of the markets where those products are sold. Therefore, trademark and trade name protection is important to our business. Although most of our trademarks are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The loss or infringement of our trademarks or tradenames could impair the goodwill associated with our brands and harm our reputation, which would harm our financial condition and operating results. 
    
  We permit the limited use of our trademarks by our representatives to assist them in the marketing of our products. It is possible that doing so may increase the risk of unauthorized use or misuse of our trademarks in markets where their registration status  
  
   51 

     Table of Contents  

differs from that asserted by our independent sales representatives, or they may be used in association with claims or products in a manner not permitted under applicable laws and regulations. Were this to occur, it is possible that this could diminish the value of these marks or otherwise impair our further use of these marks. 
    
  Our business is subject to intellectual property risks. 
    
  Many of our products are not protected by patents. Restrictive regulations governing the precise labeling of ingredients and percentages for nutritional supplements, the large number of manufacturers that produce products with many active ingredients in common and the rapid change and frequent reformulation of products make patent protection impractical. As a result, we enter into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees in our research and development activities, our independent sales representatives, suppliers, directors, officers and consultants to help protect our intellectual property, investment in research and development activities and trade secrets. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property and trademarks will be successful, nor can there be any assurance that third parties will not assert claims against us for infringement of intellectual property rights, which could result in our business being required to obtain licenses for such rights, to pay royalties or to terminate our manufacturing of infringing products, all of which could have a material negative impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price. 
    
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Our stated growth strategy is to acquire companies, some of which may not have invested in adequate systems or staffing to meet public company financial reporting standards. We review the financial reporting and other systems that each company has. However, in many cases, especially in the case of private companies we acquire, the financial systems that are in place may not be as robust as needed. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls with respect to our financial statement closing process of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our management discovered certain conditions that we deemed to be material weaknesses in our internal controls, including those at TLC. The accounting system at TLC was outdated which impacted our responsiveness. In addition, we needed to employ a greater number of staff in our finance and accounting department to maintain optimal segregation of duties and to provide optimal levels of oversight. This need for additional personnel existed during our 2014 audit. 
    
  We have taken the following actions to address the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. 

A Disclosure Committee was formed and a Committee Charter was adopted with Disclosure Controls and Procedures that were implemented this quarter. 
                
    Representatives from all business areas are represented on the committee and the SEC reporting manager presides over the meetings and minutes are kept to evidence the Committee s effectiveness. 
       
  We have taken the following actions to address the ineffectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting: 

We continue to take strides to identify, attract and retain quality staff members to provide improved segregation of duties and to assist in the identification and implementation of mitigating controls when optimal segregation is not be feasible for our newly formed entity. 
                
    We have centralized accounting at our headquarters for five of our companies. 
                
    We developed and executed a new IT project management methodology which includes documented change management and ultimate user acceptance testing. 
                
    We have migrated our largest subsidiary (prior to Kleeneze) to our new enterprise resource planning system which includes sophisticated accounting systems and we are aggressively migrating our other companies. 
                
    We have aggressively streamlined our financial close process and the related financial reporting process in order to provide management with more timely accurate information and to comply with the filing deadlines for accelerated filers. 
       
  We may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our independent sales representatives, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. 

52 

     Table of Contents  

Our independent sales representatives are subject to taxation and, in some instances, legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect taxes, such as value added taxes, and to maintain appropriate tax records. In addition, we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to our representatives. In the event that local laws and regulations require us to treat our independent sales representatives as employees, or if our representatives are deemed by local regulatory authorities to be our employees, rather than independent contractors, we may be held responsible for social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions, plus any related assessments and penalties, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. 
    
  Several of our directors and officers have other business interests. 
    
  Several of our directors have other business interests, including Mr. Rochon, who controls Richmont Holdings. Those other interests may come into conflict with our interests and the interests of our shareholders. Mr. Rochon and several of our other directors serve on the boards of directors of several other companies and, as a result of their business experience, may be asked to serve on the boards of other companies. We may compete with these other business interests for such directors  time and efforts. 
    
  The Company officers may also work for Richmont Holdings or its affiliated entities. These employees have discretion to decide what time they devote to our activities, which may result in a lack of availability when needed due to their other responsibilities. 
    
  Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is possible, depending upon future operating results and the value of our common stock. 
    
  We will test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year and in future fiscal years, and on an interim basis, if indicators of impairment exist. Factors which influence the evaluation of impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets include the price of our common stock and expected future operating results. If the carrying value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is no longer deemed to be recoverable, we potentially could incur material impairment charges. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we have included an impairment charge of $489,000 as a result of this testing. For the   three months ended June 30, 2015   we recognized an impairment charge of   $192,000  . Although we believe these charges are non-cash in nature and do not affect our operations or cash flow, these charges reduce shareholders  equity and reported results of operations in the period charged. 
    
  There currently is a limited liquid trading market for our common stock and we cannot assure investors that a robust trading market will ever develop or be sustained. 
    
  To date there has been a limited trading market for our common stock on the NYSE MKT. We cannot predict how liquid the market for our common stock may become. We believe the listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT is beneficial to us and our shareholders. However, while we believe that the NYSE MKT listing has improved the liquidity of our common stock, reduced trading volume and increased volatility may affect our share price. A lack of an active market may impair investors  ability to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price they consider reasonable. The lack of an active trading market may impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies by using our common stock as consideration. 
    
  Our common stock may not always be considered a  covered security . 
    
  The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as  covered securities.  Because our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, our common stock is a covered security. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. 
    
  Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE MKT could result in a de-listing of our common stock. 
    
  Our shares of common stock are currently listed on the NYSE MKT. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NYSE MKT, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum stockholder s equity requirement, the NYSE MKT may take steps to de-list our common stock. Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair our shareholders  ability to sell or purchase our common stock when they wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we would take actions to restore our compliance with the NYSE MKT s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us would result in our common stock becoming listed again, or that any such action would stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock. 

53

The limited trading volume of our common stock may cause volatility in our share price. 
    
  Our stock has in the past been thinly traded due to the limited number of shares available for trading on the NYSE MKT thus causing potential large swings in price. As such, investors and potential investors may find it difficult to resell their securities at or near the original purchase price or at any price. Our recent Offering, which closed on March 4, 2015, may increase the number of shares available for trading but our stock price may nevertheless be volatile. If our stock experiences volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid per share. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock and our stock price may decline substantially in a short period of time. As a result, our shareholders could suffer losses or be unable to liquidate their holdings. 
    
  Market prices for our common stock will be influenced by a number of factors, including: 

the issuance of new equity securities, including issuances of preferred stock; 
                
    the introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors; 
                
    the acquisition of new direct selling businesses; 
                
    changes in interest rates; 
                
    significant dilution caused by the anti-dilutive clauses in our financial agreements; 
                
    competitive developments, including announcements by competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; 
                
    variations in quarterly operating results; 
                
    change in financial estimates by securities analysts; 
                
    a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; 
                
    the depth and liquidity of the market for our shares of common stock; 
                
    sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by Rochon Capital, any executive officers or directors appointed in the future, or by other significant shareholders; 
                
    investor perceptions of our company and the direct selling segment generally; and 
                
    general economic and other national and international conditions. 
       
  Market price fluctuations may negatively affect the ability of investors to sell our shares at consistent prices. 
    
  Sales of our common stock under Rule 144 could impact the price of our common stock. 
    
  In general, under Rule 144 ( Rule 144 ), as promulgated under the Securities Act, persons holding restricted securities in an SEC reporting company, including affiliates, must hold their shares for a period of at least six months, may not sell more than 1% of the total issued and outstanding shares in any 90-day period and must resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price. Whenever a substantial number of shares of our common stock become available for resale under Rule 144, the market price for our common stock will likely be impacted. 
    
  Reports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our common stock price and trading volume. 
    
  Securities research analysts, including those affiliated with our underwriters, establish and publish their own periodic projections for our business. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if our actual results do not match securities research analysts  projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who writes reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline. While we expect securities research analyst coverage, if no securities or industry analysts begin to cover us, the trading price for our stock and the trading volume could be adversely affected. 
    
  Class action litigation due to stock price volatility or other factors could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources. 
    
  It is not uncommon for securities class action litigation to be brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of such company s securities. Companies in certain industries are particularly vulnerable to this kind of litigation due to the high volatility of their stock prices. Our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past. This may be a result of, among other things, variations in our results of operations and announcements by us and our competitors, as well as general economic conditions. Our stock price may continue to experience substantial volatility. Accordingly, we may in the  
  
   54 

     Table of Contents  

future be the target of securities litigation. Any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of our management. 
    
  We may issue additional securities in the future, which will reduce investors  ownership percentage in our outstanding securities and will dilute our share value. 
    
  If future operations or acquisitions are financed through issuing equity securities, shareholders could experience significant dilution. The issuance of our common stock in the Offering resulted in dilution to existing shareholders and the issuance of additional shares of common stock and/or Warrants pursuant to the Underwriters  over-allotment option as well as the exercise of any Warrants issued in the Offering will result in additional dilution to current shareholders. In addition, securities issued in connection with future financing activities or potential acquisitions may have rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of our common stock. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of options, which we may grant in the future, may result in dilution to our shareholders. In addition, the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of the At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement, may result in dilution to our shareholders. Our articles of incorporation currently authorize us to issue 2,000 shares of common stock. Assuming the issuance of the Second Tranche Stock (which shares may only be issued under certain limited circumstances, as described above), the number of outstanding shares of our common stock would increase to in excess of 60,000,000 with approximately 190,000,000 shares of our common stock available for issuance. The future issuance of our common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders. We may issue common stock in the future, including for services or acquisitions or other corporate actions that may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our shareholders, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock. 
    
  We have not paid and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock. 
    
  We have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date and it is not anticipated that any dividends will be paid to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. While our future dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of our businesses, it is currently anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance our future expansion and for the implementation of our business strategy. Our shareholders will not realize a return on their investment in us unless and until they sell shares after the trading price of our common stock appreciates from the price at which a shareholder purchased shares of our common stock. As an investor, you should consider that a lack of a dividend can further affect the market value of our common stock and could significantly affect the value of any investment in our company. 
    
  Complying with federal securities laws as a publicly traded company is expensive. Any deficiencies in our financial reporting or internal controls could adversely affect our financial condition, ability to issue our shares in acquisitions and the trading price of our common stock. 
    
  Companies listed on the NYSE MKT, such as our company, must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and must be current in their reports under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, in order to maintain the listing on NYSE MKT. We file quarterly and annual reports containing our financial statements with the SEC. We may experience difficulty in meeting the SEC s reporting requirements. Any failure by us to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC could harm our reputation, reduce the trading price of our common stock and cause sanctions or other actions to be taken by the SEC against us. A failure to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC could cause additional harm, such as a default under an indenture or loan covenant that we may enter into from time to time. In addition, our failure to timely file periodic or certain current reports with the SEC could result in our failure to meet the conditions that would require a cash exercise of the Warrants issued in the Offering and result in our inability to remain S-3 eligible. We will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses related to compliance with applicable securities laws. 
    
  Our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Florida law have anti-takeover provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, which may cause our stock price to decline. 
    
  Our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Florida law contain provisions which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders. We are authorized to issue up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock. This preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our Board without further action by shareholders. The terms of any series of preferred stock may include preferential voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividend, liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock, and therefore, reduce the value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to, a third party and thereby preserve control by the present management. 
  
   55 

     Table of Contents  

Provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Florida law also could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals or making a tender offer or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes a shareholder might consider favorable. Such provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management. In particular, the articles of incorporation, bylaws and Florida law, as applicable, among other things, provide the Board with the ability to alter the bylaws without shareholder approval, and provide that vacancies on the Board may be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum. 
    
  In addition, the Amended Share Exchange Agreement provides for the issuance of the Second Tranche Stock to Rochon Capital solely upon the occurrence of certain stock acquisitions by third parties or the announcement of certain tender or exchange offers of our common stock. The Second Tranche Stock, which possess no rights other than voting rights, may serve as a further deterrent to third parties looking to acquire us. See the section entitled  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence  in the Company's Form 10-K/A. 
    
  Resales of our common stock in the public market by our stockholders may cause the market price of our common stock to fall. 
    
  This issuance of shares of common stock in any offering, including the Offering, could result in resales of our common stock by our current stockholders concerned about the potential dilution of their holdings. In turn, these resales could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock. 
    
  There is no public market for the Warrants to purchase shares of our common stock that were sold in the Offering. 
    
  There is no established public trading market for the Warrants, and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply to list the Warrants on any national securities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system, including the NYSE MKT. Without an active market, the liquidity of the Warrants will be limited. 
    
  Due to the speculative nature of warrants, there is no guarantee that it will ever be profitable for holders of the Warrants to exercise the Warrants. 
    
  The Warrants that were issued in the Offering do not confer any rights of share ownership on their holders, such as voting rights or the right to receive dividends, but rather merely represent the right to acquire our common stock at a fixed price for a limited period of time. Holders of Warrants may exercise their right to acquire the common stock underlying the Warrants at any time after the date of issuance by paying an exercise price of $3.75 per share, prior to their expiration on the date that is five years from the date of issuance, after which date any unexercised warrants will expire and have no further value. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will ever equal or exceed the exercise price of the Warrants, and, consequently, whether it will ever be profitable for investors to exercise their Warrants.

Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  On July 22, 2015 we issued a warrant exercisable for 50,000 shares of common stock in exchange for a previously-issued warrant exercisable for 50,000 shares of common stock. The new warrant has an extended exercise period. The new warrant was issued in reliance upon Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the exchange was with an existing security holder exclusively and no commissioner remuneration was paid or given in the exchange.
