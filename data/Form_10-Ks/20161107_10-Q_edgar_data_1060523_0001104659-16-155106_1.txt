  September 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  
     
  Note 1  
     
   Organization   
     
  Cardinal Financial Corporation (the  Company  or  Cardinal ) is incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia as a financial holding company whose activities consist of investment in its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The principal operating subsidiary of the Company is Cardinal Bank (the  Bank ), a state-chartered institution and its subsidiary, George Mason Mortgage, LLC ( George Mason ), a mortgage banking company based in Fairfax, Virginia. In addition to the Bank, the Company has one nonbank subsidiary, Cardinal Wealth Services, Inc. ( CWS ), an investment services subsidiary.  
     
  On January 16, 2014, the Company announced the completion of its acquisition of United Financial Banking Companies, Inc. ( UFBC ), the holding company of The Business Bank ( TBB ), pursuant to a previously announced definitive merger agreement.  The merger of UFBC into Cardinal was effective January 16, 2014.  TBB, which was headquartered in Vienna, Virginia, merged into Cardinal Bank effective March 8, 2014.  
     
  On August 18, 2016, the Company announced that it will merge with United Bankshares, Inc., ( United ), a West Virginia corporation headquartered in Charleston.   Under the terms of the merger agreement, United will acquire the Company, with common shareholders of the Company receiving 0.71 shares of United common stock for each share of Cardinal Financial. The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close during the second quarter of 2017.  
     
   Basis of Presentation   
     
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X, Article 10. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. However, all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016. The unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes to financial statements that are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
  Note 2  
     
   Stock-Based Compensation   
     
  At September 30, 2016, the Company had two stock-based employee compensation plans, the 1999 Stock Option Plan (the  Option Plan ) and the 2002 Equity Compensation Plan (the  Equity Plan ).  
     
  In 1998, the Company adopted the Option Plan pursuant to which the Company could grant stock options for up to 625,000 shares of the Company s common stock to employees and members of the Company s and its subsidiaries  boards of directors. As of November 23, 2008, the Option Plan expired, and therefore, there are no shares of common stock available to grant under this plan.

Table of Contents   
     
  In 2002, the Company adopted the Equity Plan. The Equity Plan was amended in 2011 to increase the number of shares available under the plan and extend the term to 2021.  The Equity Plan authorizes the granting of options, which may be incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, phantom stock awards and performance share awards to directors, eligible officers and key employees of the Company.  There were 94,576 shares of the Company s common stock available for future grants and awards in the Equity Plan as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. Director stock options have ten year terms and vest and become fully exercisable at the grant date. Certain employee stock options have ten year terms and vest and become fully exercisable in 25% increments beginning as of the date of grant. In addition, the Company has granted stock options to employees of the Company that have ten year terms and vest and become fully exercisable in 20% annual increments beginning after their first year of service.  Other grants have ten year terms and vest and become fully exercisable in one-third increments beginning as of the date of grant.  
     
  Restricted stock awards are granted at the fair value of the Company s common stock on the grant date.  Most employee restricted stock awards vest in one-third increments on the anniversary date of the grant.  Certain restricted stock awards granted to executive officers vest one-third immediately on the grant date with the remaining unvested options vesting over the next two years.  
     
  The Company has only made awards of stock options and restricted stock under the Option Plan and the Equity Plan.  
     
  Total expense related to the Company s share-based compensation plans for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $408,000 and $344,000, respectively.  Total stock compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively.  The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation arrangements was $138,000 and $115,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, total income tax benefit recognized in the income statements for share-based compensation arrangements was $668,000 and $405,000, respectively.  
     
  No options were granted for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 17,000 were granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Options granted for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were 750 and 119,000, respectively.  The weighted average per share fair value of stock option grants for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $5.59.  The weighted average per share fair value of stock option grants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $6.98 and $5.95, respectively.   The fair values of the options granted during all periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following weighted average assumptions:

Table of Contents   
     
  Expected volatility is based upon the average annual historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The estimated option life is derived from specific historical data to estimate the expected term of the option, such as employee option exercise and employee post-vesting departure behavior. The risk free interest rate is based upon the seven-year U.S. Treasury note rate in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is based upon implied and historical dividend declarations.  
     
  Stock option activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is summarized as follows:  

The intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively. For options exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the intrinsic value of options was $3,000 and $1.2 million, respectively.  
     
  A summary of the status of the Company s non-vested stock options and changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:

  A summary of the Company s restricted stock grant activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:  

At September 30, 2016, there was $2.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years. The total fair value of shares from stock options that vested during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $41,000 and $44,000, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the total fair value of shares that vested was $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively.  The total fair value of restricted stock grants that vested during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $199,000 and $1.2 million, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock grants that vested during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $0 and $134,000, respectively.

In addition, this segment provides customers with several choices of deposit products including demand deposit accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit.

  The Company did not have any operating segments other than those reported. Parent company financial information is included in the  Other  category and represents an overhead function rather than an operating segment. The parent company s most significant assets are its net investments in its subsidiaries. The parent company s net interest expense is comprised of interest income from short-term investments and interest expense on trust preferred securities.  
     
  Note 4  
     
   Earnings Per Share   
     
  The following is the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  There were 0 and 150 antidilutive outstanding stock options excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. There were no antidilutive outstanding stock options excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.   There were no antidilutive outstanding restricted stock awards excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.   There were 6 and 363 antidilutive outstanding restricted stock grants excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Weighted average shares for the basic earnings per share calculation is increased by the number of shares required to be issued under the Company s various deferred compensation plans.  These plans provide for a Company match, and such match must be in the common stock of the Company.  Employees who participate in the Company s deferred compensation plans can allocate, at their discretion, their contributions to various investment options, including an option to invest in Company Common Stock.  The incremental weighted average shares attributable to the deferred compensation plans included in diluted outstanding shares assumes the participants opt to invest all of their contributions into the Company s Common Stock investment option.

  The approximate fair value and amortized cost of investment securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are shown in the table below.  

The fair value and amortized cost of investment securities by contractual maturity at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are shown below.  Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because many issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The following table shows the Company s investment securities  gross unrealized losses and their fair value, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

  The Company estimates the fair value of its pooled trust preferred securities portfolio by using third party projected cash flows for each of the issuances in the portfolio, and a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the expected cash flows is applied to arrive at the estimated fair value.  
     
  The Company completes reviews for other-than-temporary impairment at least quarterly.  As of September 30, 2016, the majority of the investment securities portfolio consisted of securities rated AAA by a leading rating agency.  Investment securities which carry a AAA rating are judged to be of the best quality and carry the smallest degree of investment risk.  At September 30, 2016, 99% of the Company s mortgage-related securities are guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA).  
     
  The Company has $796,000 in non-government non-agency mortgage-related securities in its available-for-sale portfolio.  The various protective elements on the non-agency securities may change in the future if market conditions or the financial stability of credit insurers changes, which could impact the ratings of these securities.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, certain of the Company s investment grade securities were in an unrealized loss position.  Investment securities with unrealized losses are a result of pricing changes due to recent and negative conditions in the current market environment and not as a result of permanent credit impairment.  Contractual cash flows for the agency mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed and/or funded by the U.S. government.  Other mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities have third party protective elements and there are no negative indications that the contractual cash flows will not be received when due.  The Company does not intend to sell nor does the Company believe it will be required to sell any of the temporarily impaired securities prior to the recovery of the amortized cost.  
     
  No other-than-temporary impairment was recognized for the securities in the Company s investment portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  The Company has investment assets designated as trading to economically hedge against fair value changes in the Company s nonqualified deferred compensation plan liability.  Those investments are designated as trading securities, and as such, the changes in fair value are reflected in earnings.  Trading securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:

  The loan portfolio at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist of the following:

Table of Contents   
     
  The loan portfolio is segregated into two components:  loans accounted for under the amortized cost method (referred to as  originated  loans) and loans acquired (referred to as  acquired  loans).  
     
  The loans in the acquired loan portfolio were initially measured at fair value and subsequently accounted for under either Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 310-30 or ASC 310-20.  The outstanding principal balance and related carrying amount of acquired loans included in the consolidated statements of condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:  

The following tables present the changes in the total discount when comparing the outstanding principal balance of acquired loans to the carrying amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

The Company s allowance for loan losses is based first on a segmentation of its loan portfolio by general loan type, or portfolio segments, as presented in the preceding table.  For originated loans, certain portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on class segments, which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan.  The Company also maintains an allowance for loan losses for acquired loans when: (i) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, there is deterioration in credit quality subsequent to acquisition, and (ii) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-20, the inherent losses in the loans exceed the remaining credit discount recorded at the time of acquisition.  
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an allowance for loan losses for the acquired loan portfolio of $(5,000) and $442,000, respectively.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company did not record an allowance for loan losses for the acquired loan portfolio. There were no impairments recorded in the purchased credit impaired portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
  An analysis of the allowance for loan losses based on loan type, or segment, and the Company s loan portfolio, which identifies certain loans that are evaluated for individual or collective impairment, as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 and December 31, 2015, are below:

The accounting policy related to the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy given the level of estimation, judgment and uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the allowance required for the inherent probable losses in the loan portfolio and the material effect such estimation, judgment and uncertainty can have on the consolidated financial results.  
     
  The Company s ongoing credit quality management process relies on a system of activities to assess and evaluate various factors that impact the estimation of the allowance for loan losses.  These factors include, but are not limited to; current economic conditions; loan concentrations, collateral adequacy and value; past loss experience for particular types of loans; size, composition and nature of loans; migration of loans through our loan rating methodology; trends in charge-offs and recoveries.

  This process also contemplates a disciplined approach to managing and monitoring credit exposures to ensure that the structure and pricing of credit remains consistent with the Company s assessment of risk.  The loan officer has frequent contact with the borrower and is a key player in the credit management process and must develop and diligently practice sound credit management skills and habits to ensure effectiveness.  Under the direction of the Company s loan committee and the chief credit officer, the credit risk management function works with the loan officers and other groups within the Company to monitor the loan portfolio, maintain the watch list, and compile the analysis necessary to determine the allowance for loan losses.  
     
  Loans are added to the watch list when circumstances appear to warrant the inclusion of the relationship.  As a general rule, loans are added to the watch list when they are deemed to be problem assets.  Problem assets are defined as those that have been risk rated substandard or lower.   Successful problem asset management requires early recognition of deteriorating credits and timely corrective or risk management actions.  Generally, risk ratings are either approved or amended by the loan committee accordingly.  Problem loans are maintained on the watch list until the loan is either paid off or circumstances around the borrower s situation improve to the point that the risk rating on the loan is adjusted upward.  
     
  In addition to internal activities, the Company also engages an external consultant on a quarterly basis to review the Company s loan portfolio.  This external loan review function helps to ensure the soundness of the loan portfolio through a third party review of existing exposures in the portfolio, supporting the commercial loan officers in the execution of its credit management responsibilities, and monitoring the adherence to the Company s credit risk management standards.

   Impaired Loans - Acquired Loan Portfolio   
   At December 31, 2015

In order to maximize the collection of certain loans, the Company will attempt to work with borrowers when necessary to extend or modify loan terms to better align with the borrower s ability to repay.  Extensions and modifications to loans are made in accordance with the Company s policy and conform to regulatory guidance.  Each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately.  The Company considers regulatory guidelines when restructuring a loan to ensure that prudent lending practices are followed.  As such, qualification criteria and payment terms consider the borrower s current and prospective ability to comply with the modified terms of the loan.  
     
 30   

Table of Contents   
     
  A modification is classified as a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ) if both of the following exist: (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) the Company has granted a concession to the borrower.  The Company determines that a borrower may be experiencing financial difficulty if the borrower is currently in default on any of its debt, or if the Company is concerned that the borrower may not be able to perform in accordance with the current terms of the loan agreement in the foreseeable future.  
     
  Although each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately, for all portfolio segments, TDRs are typically modified through reductions in interest rates, reductions in payments, changing the payment terms from principal and interest to interest only, and/or extensions in term maturity.  
     
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no loans modified in a TDR.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had two TDRs totaling $356,000 and $365,000, respectively (both of which are related to one borrower).  Loans reported as TDRs as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are not on nonaccrual.  While the borrower is having financial difficulty, the borrower has not missed a scheduled payment under the terms of the loan agreement.  The Company did not place these TDRs on nonaccrual as the only concession granted to the borrower was an extension of the maturity date to provide the borrower additional time needed to sell the collateral associated with these two loans.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, these loans are performing as expected post-modification. There were no acquired loans classified as TDRs.  For restructured loans in the portfolio, the Company had no loan loss reserves at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  There were no outstanding commitments to advance additional funds to customer relationships whose loans had been restructured as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  Loans modified as TDRs within the previous 12 months and for which there was a payment default during the period are calculated by first identifying TDRs that defaulted during the period and then determining whether they were modified within the 12 months prior to the default.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no loans modified during the previous 12 months that defaulted during the period.  
     
  One of the most significant factors in assessing the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio is the risk rating.  The Company uses the following risk ratings to manage the credit quality of its loan portfolio: pass, other loans especially mentioned (OLEM), substandard, doubtful and loss.  OLEM are those loans in which the borrower exhibits potential weakness that may, if not corrected or reversed, weaken the Bank s credit position at some future date.  These loans may not show problems as yet due to the borrower s apparent ability to service the debt, but special circumstances surround the loans of which the Bank s management should be aware.  Substandard risk rated loans are those loans whose full final collectability may not appear to be a matter for serious doubt, but which nevertheless have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and require close supervision by management.  Loans that have a risk rating of doubtful have all the weakness inherent in one graded substandard with the added provision that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and value, highly questionable.  A loss loan is one that is considered uncollectible and will be charged-off immediately.  All other loans not rated OLEM, substandard, doubtful or loss are considered to have a pass risk rating.  Substandard and doubtful risk rated loans are evaluated for impairment.  The following table presents a summary of the risk ratings by portfolio segment and class segment at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities   
     
  The Company records its derivatives at their fair values in either a gain or loss position and is presented on a gross basis in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the statement of condition.  The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. For derivatives designated as hedges, the Company contemporaneously documents the hedging relationship, including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, how effectiveness will be assessed at inception and at each reporting period and the method for measuring ineffectiveness.  The Company evaluates the effectiveness of these transactions at inception and on an ongoing basis.  Ineffectiveness is recorded through earnings.  For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, except for the ineffective portion which is recorded in earnings.  For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the fair value adjustments for both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are recorded through the income statement with any difference considered the ineffective portion of the hedge.  The Company discontinues hedge accounting when i) the hedge is no longer considered highly effective or ii) the derivative matures or is sold or terminates.  When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable an anticipated loan sale will not occur, the Company recognizes immediately in earnings any gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income.

  The Company enters into rate lock commitments to finance residential mortgage loans with its customers.  These commitments, which contain fixed expiration dates, offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by the Company. Interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor. The Company is also a party to forward mortgage loan sales contracts to sell loans servicing released and short sales of mortgage-backed securities.  When the interest rate is locked with the borrower, the rate lock commitment, forward sale agreement, and mortgage-backed security position are undesignated derivatives and marked to fair value through earnings.  The fair value of the rate lock derivative includes the servicing premium and the interest spread for the difference between retail and wholesale mortgage rates.  Realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities represents the gain recognized for the period presented and associated elements of fair value.  
     
  The Company sells mortgage loans on either a best efforts or mandatory delivery basis.  For those loans selected to be sold under best efforts delivery, at the closing of the loan, the rate lock commitment derivative expires and the Company records a loan held for sale at lower of cost or fair value and continues to be obligated under the same forward loan sales contract entered into at inception of the rate lock commitment.  On the date the mortgage loan closes, the anticipated future sales proceeds from loan held for sale is designated as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge relationship and the forward loan sale commitment is designated as the hedging instrument.  
     
  For loans sold on a mandatory  delivery basis, the Company enters into a trade of mortgage-backed securities (the  residual hedge ) to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk.  Both the rate lock commitment under mandatory delivery and the residual hedge are recorded at fair value through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges.  At the closing of the mandatory delivery loan, the loan commitment derivative expires and the Company records a loan held for sale at fair value and continues to mark these assets to market under the election of fair value option. The Company closes out of the trading mortgage-backed securities assigned within the residual hedge and replaces the securities with a forward sales contract once a price has been accepted by an investor and recorded at fair value. 
     
  At September 30, 2016, accumulated other comprehensive income included an unrealized loss, net of tax, of $201,000 related to forward loan sales contracts designated as the hedging instrument in the cash flow hedge related to best efforts delivery. Loans held for sale are generally sold within thirty days of closing and, therefore, all or substantially all of the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at September 30, 2016 which is related to the Company s cash flow hedges will be recognized in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized minimal amounts due to cash flow hedge ineffectiveness.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized net gains of $166,000 and $590,000, respectively, related to the fair values of the mandatory rate lock commitments and loans held for sale under mandatory delivery net of losses related to the residual hedge.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, the Company had $376.3 million in residential mortgage rate lock commitments and associated forward sales and mortgage-backed securities in the residual hedge, and $136.6 million in forward loan sales associated with $432.3 million of loans that had closed and were presented as held for sale.  
     
  The following tables disclose the derivative instruments  location on the Company s statement of condition and the fair value of those instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  In addition, the gains and losses related to these derivative instruments are provided for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

   Goodwill and Other Intangibles   
     
  Information concerning total amortizable other intangible assets at September 30, 2016 is as follows:  

The aggregate amortization expense was $147,000 and $180,000 for three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the aggregate amortization expense was $461,000 and $565,000, respectively.   The estimated amortization expense for the next five years and thereafter is as follows:

  The carrying amount of goodwill at September 30, 2016 was as follows:  

Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant.  
     
  The Company performs its annual recoverability assessment each September for the commercial and mortgage banking business segments.  After evaluating all relevant facts and circumstances, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of both the commercial and mortgage banking reporting units exceed their carrying value and no goodwill impairment is indicated.  
     
  Note 9  
     
   Commitments and Contingencies   
     
  The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.  Commitments usually have fixed expiration dates up to one year or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  These instruments represent obligations of the Company to extend credit or guarantee borrowings and are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition.  The rates and terms of these instruments are competitive with others in the market in which the Company operates.  
     
  The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.  The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis and requires collateral to support financial instruments when deemed necessary.  The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based upon management s evaluation of the counterparty.  Collateral held varies but may include deposits held by the Company, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.  
     
  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of the contractual obligations by a customer to a third party.  The majority of these guarantees extend until satisfactory completion of the customer s contractual obligations.  All standby letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2016 are collateralized.  
     
  Commitments to extend credit of $1.2 billion primarily have floating rates as of September 30, 2016.  At September 30, 2016, standby letters of credit were $35.5 million. In addition, commitments to extend credit of $411.2 million as of September 30, 2016 are related to George Mason s mortgage loan funding commitments and are of a short term nature.  
     
  These off-balance sheet financial instruments may involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition.  Credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because the other parties to a financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract.  The Company s

  maximum exposure to credit loss under standby letters of credit and commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments. It is uncertain as to the amount, if any, that the Company will be required to fund on these commitments as many such arrangements expire with no amounts drawn.  
     
  George Mason provides for its estimated exposure to repurchase loans previously sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or where the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor, and for other exposure to its investors related to loan sales activities.  The Company evaluates the merits of each claim and estimates its reserve based on actual and expected claims received and considers the historical amounts paid to settle such claims. George Mason has a reserve of $0 and $500,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
     
  The Company has derivative counter-party risk that may arise from the possible inability of George Mason s third party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts.  George Mason works with third-party investors that are generally well-capitalized, are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk.  The Company does not expect any third-party investor to fail to meet its obligation.  
     
  Note 10  
     
   Fair Value Measurements   
     
  The fair value framework under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  It also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring the fair value.  There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  
     
  Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date.  
     
  Level 2   Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.  
     
  Level 3   Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.  
     
   Recurring Fair Value Measurements   
     
  All classes of the Company s investment securities available-for-sale, the Company s trading investment securities, which include cash equivalents and mutual funds, and bank-owned life insurance are recorded at fair value, measured using reliable and unbiased valuations by an industry-wide valuation service and therefore fall into the Level 2 category.  This service uses evaluated pricing models that vary based on asset class and include available trade, bid, and other market information.  Generally, the methodology includes broker quotes, proprietary models, vast descriptive terms and conditions databases, as well as extensive quality control programs.  
     
  The Company records its interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sales commitments at fair value determined as the amount that would be required to settle each of these derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.  In the normal course of business, George Mason enters into contractual interest rate lock commitments to extend credit to borrowers with fixed expiration dates.  The commitments become effective when the borrowers  lock-in  a specified interest rate within the time

  frames established by the mortgage companies.  All borrowers are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment.  Market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the interest rate lock by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to the investor.  To mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers, George Mason enters into either a forward sales contract to sell loans to investors when using best efforts or a TBA mortgage-backed security under mandatory delivery.  As TBA mortgage-backed securities are actively traded in an open market, TBA mortgage-backed securities fall into a Level 1 category.  The forward sales contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments.  Under the Company s best efforts model, the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sales contracts to investors through to the date the loan closes are undesignated derivatives and accordingly, are marked to fair value through earnings.  These valuations fall into a Level 2 category.  
     
  For residential mortgage loans sold on a mandatory delivery basis,  the interest rate lock commitments and associated loans closed are recorded at fair value which is measured using valuations from investors for loans with similar characteristics adjusted for the Company s actual sales experience versus the investor s indicated pricing.  These valuations fall into the Level 3 category.  
     
  There were no significant transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of each reporting period.  The valuation technique used for fair value measurements using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) is the market approach for each class of assets and liabilities.  
     
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are shown below:

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company updated its fair valuation technique for interest rate lock commitments and loans held for sale under mandatory delivery.  A reconciliation of recurring fair value measurements categorized as Level 3 is presented below:  

Quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the Level 3 fair value measurement for mandatory interest rate lock commitments and loans held for sale is presented below.

Table of Contents   
     
   Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements   
     
  Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are not included in the tables above.  These assets include the valuation of the Company s loans receivable   evaluated for impairment and other real estate owned. Neither was measured at fair value at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  
     
  In addition, loans held for sale that are delivered on a best efforts basis are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.  Loans held for sale with fair values less than cost are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  Fair value for fixed rate residential mortgages is based upon the pricing of similar coupon mortgage-backed securities and for adjustable rate loans the Company uses investor indicated pricing.  Loans held for sale that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $34.2 million and $335,000, respectively.  
     
  The Company s loans receivable   evaluated for impairment are measured at the present value of its expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s coupon rate, or at the loan s observable market price or fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  The Company measures the collateral value on loans receivable   evaluated for impairment by obtaining an updated appraisal of the underlying collateral and may discount further the appraised value, if necessary, to an amount equal to the expected cash proceeds in the event the loan is foreclosed upon and the collateral is sold.  This third party appraisal data is based on market comparisons and may be subject to further adjustment for certain non-observable criteria.  In addition, an estimate of costs to sell the collateral is assumed.  
     
  Although management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of financial instruments, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique.  Because of the wide range of valuation techniques and the numerous estimates and assumptions which must be made, it may be difficult to make reasonable comparisons between the Company s fair value information and that of other banking institutions.  It is important that the many uncertainties be considered when using the estimated fair value disclosures and that, because of these uncertainties, the aggregate fair value amount should not be construed as representative of the underlying value of the Company.  
     
   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
     
  The assumptions used and the estimates disclosed represent management s best judgment of appropriate valuation methods for estimating the fair value of financial instruments.  These estimates are based on pertinent information available to management at the valuation date.  In certain cases, fair values are not subject to precise quantification or verification and may change as economic and market factors and management s evaluation of those factors change.  
     
  The following summarizes the significant methodologies and assumptions used in estimating the fair values presented in the following table, and not disclosed elsewhere in this footnote.  
     
   Cash and Cash Equivalents   
     
  The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents is used as a reasonable estimate of fair value.  
     
   Investment Securities Held-to-Maturity and Other Investments   
     
  Fair values for certain investment securities held-to-maturity are based on quoted market prices or prices quoted for similar financial instruments.  For the pooled trust preferred securities that are held-to-maturity, the Company estimates the fair value of these securities through the use of internal calculations and through information provided by external pricing sources.  Certain other investments such as Federal Home Loan Bank stock is recorded at cost as this is the estimated fair value based on its redemption provisions.  
     
 48   

Table of Contents   
     
   Loans Held for Sale   
     
  Loans held for sale that are sold under best efforts delivery are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value.  The estimated fair value is based upon the related purchase price commitments from secondary market investors.  
     
   Loans Receivable, Net   
     
  In order to determine the fair market value for loans receivable, the loan portfolio was segmented based on loan type, credit quality and maturities.  For certain variable rate loans with no significant credit concerns and frequent repricings, estimated fair values are based on current carrying amounts.  The fair values of other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, at interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.  The fair value analysis also included other assumptions to estimate fair value, intended to approximate those a market participant would use in an orderly transaction, with adjustments for discount rates, interest rates, liquidity, as appropriate.  This method of estimating fair value does not incorporate the exit-price concept of fair value which is appropriate for this disclosure.  
     
   Deposits   
     
  The fair values for demand deposits are equal to the carrying amount since they are payable on demand at the reporting date.  The carrying amounts of variable rate, fixed-term money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) approximate their fair value at the reporting date.  Fair values for fixed rate CDs are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on CDs to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.  
     
   Other Borrowed Funds   
     
  The fair value of other borrowed funds is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently available for loans with similar terms.  
     
   Accrued Interest Receivable   
     
  The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value.

   Item 2.         Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    
     
  The following presents management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the results of our operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
   Caution About Forward-Looking Statements   
     
  We make certain forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q that are subject to risks and uncertainties.  These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our profitability, liquidity, allowance for loan losses, interest rate sensitivity, market risk, growth strategy, and financial and other goals.  The words  believes,   expects,   may,   will,   should,   projects,   contemplates,   anticipates,   forecasts,   intends,  or other similar words or terms are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  
     
  These forward-looking statements are subject to significant uncertainties because they are based upon or are affected by factors including:  
     
                        the businesses of the Company and United may not be combined successfully, or such combination may take longer, be more difficult, time-consuming or costly to accomplish than expected; 
     
                        the expected growth opportunities or cost savings from the Merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; 
     
                        deposit attrition, operating costs, customer losses and business disruption following the Merger, including adverse effects on relationships with employees, may be greater than expected; 
     
                        the regulatory approvals required for the Merger may not be obtained on the proposed terms or on the anticipated schedule; 
     
                        the stockholders of the Company or United may fail to approve the Merger; 
     
                        termination of the merger agreement, or failure to complete the Merger, could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results; 
     
                        we will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending that could be harmful to our operations; 
     
                        if the Merger is not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses and committed substantial time and resources without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger. 
     
                        the risks of changes in interest rates on levels, composition and costs of deposits, loan demand, and the values and liquidity of loan collateral, securities, and interest sensitive assets and liabilities; 
     
                        changes in assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for possible loan losses, reserves for repurchases of mortgage loans sold and other estimates; 
     
                        changes in market conditions, specifically declines in the residential and commercial real estate market, volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, soundness of other financial institutions we do business with; 
     
                        decrease in the volume of loan originations at our mortgage banking subsidiary as a result of the cyclical nature of mortgage banking, changes in interest rates, economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market which would negatively impact the income recorded on the sales of loans held for sale; 
     
                        risks inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values; 
     
                        declines in the prices of assets and market illiquidity may cause us to record an other-than-temporary impairment or other losses, specifically in our pooled trust preferred securities portfolio resulting from increases in underlying issuers  defaulting or deferring payments; 
     
                        changes in operations within the wealth management services segment, its customer base and assets under management; 
     
                        changes in operations of George Mason Mortgage, LLC as a result of the activity in the residential real estate market and any associated impact on the fair value of goodwill in the future; 
     
                        legislative and regulatory changes, including the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Financial Reform Act ) and other changes in banking, securities, and tax laws and regulations and their application by our regulators, and changes in the scope and cost of FDIC insurance and other coverages; 
     
                        exposure to repurchase loans sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on or related to their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor; 
     
                        the risks of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, including, without limitation, the related time and costs of implementing such transactions, integrating operations as part of these transactions and possible failures to achieve expected gains, revenue growth and/or expense savings from such transactions; 
     
                        the ability to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategies if we implement new or change internal operating systems or if we are unable to identify attractive markets, locations or opportunities to expand in the future;

  In addition, this section should be read in conjunction with the description of our  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
   Overview   
     
  We are a financial holding company formed in 1997 and headquartered in Fairfax County, Virginia.  We own Cardinal Bank, or the Bank, a Virginia state-chartered community bank with 29 banking offices located in Northern Virginia and the greater Washington D.C. metropolitan area.  The Bank offers a wide range of traditional bank loan and deposit products and services to both our commercial and retail customers.  Our commercial relationship managers focus on attracting small and medium sized businesses as well as government contractors, commercial real estate developers and builders and professionals, such as physicians, accountants and attorneys.  
     
  Additionally, we complement our core banking operations by offering a wide range of services through our various subsidiaries, including mortgage banking through George Mason Mortgage, LLC ( George Mason ) and retail securities brokerage through Cardinal Wealth Services, Inc. ( CWS ).  
     
  On August 18, 2016, we announced that we will merge with United Bankshares, Inc., ( United ), a West Virginia corporation headquartered in Charleston.   Under the terms of the merger agreement, United will acquire the Company, with our common shareholders receiving 0.71 shares of United common stock for each share of Cardinal (the  Merger ). The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close during the second quarter of 2017.  
     
  Net interest income is our primary source of revenue. We define revenue as net interest income plus noninterest income. As discussed further in the interest rate sensitivity section, we manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk exposure to maximize, and concurrently stabilize, net interest income. We do this by monitoring our liquidity position and the spread between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. We attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk, but are unable to eliminate it entirely.  In addition to management of interest rate risk, we analyze our loan portfolio for exposure to credit risk. Loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent risks in the banking industry, and we attempt to limit our exposure to these risks by carefully underwriting and then monitoring our extensions of credit. In addition to net interest income, noninterest income is an important source of revenue for us and includes, among other things, service charges on deposits and loans, investment fee income, gains and losses on sales of investment securities available-for-sale, and gains on sales of mortgage loans.

   Critical Accounting Policies   
     
   General   
     
  U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting, reporting, and disclosure matters.  Management must use assumptions, judgments and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical.  These policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments, assumptions and estimates.  Changes in such judgments, assumptions and estimates may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.  Actual results, in fact, could differ from initial estimates.  
     
  The accounting policies we view as critical are those relating to judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding the determination of the allowance for loan losses, accounting for purchased credit-impaired loans, the fair value measurements of certain assets and liabilities, accounting for economic hedging activities, and accounting for impairment testing of goodwill.  
     
   Allowance for Loan Losses   
     
  We maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management s best estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio.  Both the amount of the provision expense and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors, including general and industry-specific economic conditions, actual and expected credit losses, historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers.  Unusual and infrequently occurring events, such as weather-related disasters, may impact our assessment of possible credit losses.  As a part of our analysis, we use our historical losses, loss emergence experience and qualitative factors, such as levels of and trends in delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charged-off loans, changes in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in lending policy, experience and ability and depth of management, national and local economic trends and conditions, and concentrations of credit, competition, and loan review results to support our estimates.  
     
  The allowance for loan losses is based first on a segmentation of the loan portfolio by general loan type, or portfolio segments.  For originated loans, certain portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on class segments, which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan.  For purposes of this analysis, we categorize loans into one of five categories:  commercial and industrial, commercial real estate (including construction), home equity lines of credit, residential mortgages, and consumer loans.  We also maintain an allowance for loan losses for acquired loans when: (i) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, there is deterioration in credit quality subsequent to acquisition, and (ii) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-20, the inherent losses in the loans exceed the remaining credit discount recorded at the time of acquisition.  
     
  During the fourth quarter of 2014, we transitioned to using our historical loss experience and trends in losses for each category which were then adjusted for portfolio trends and economic and environmental factors in determining the allowance for loan losses.  The indicated loss factors resulting from this analysis are applied to each of the five categories of loans.  Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, the allowance model used the average loss rates of similar institutions based on its custom peer group as a baseline, which was adjusted for its particular loan portfolio characteristics and environmental factors.  These changes did not have an impact to the overall allowance.  
     
  The allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, individually evaluated for impairment. We individually assign loss factors to all loans that have been identified as having loss attributes, as indicated by deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in underlying collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent.  In certain cases, we apply, in accordance with regulatory guidelines, a 5% loss factor to all loans classified as special mention, a 15% loss factor to all loans classified as substandard and a 50% loss factor to all loans classified as doubtful.  Loans classified as loss loans are fully reserved or charged-off.   However, in most instances, we evaluate the impairment of certain loans on a loan by loan basis for those loans that are adversely risk rated.  For these loans, we analyze the fair value of the collateral underlying the loan and consider estimated costs to sell the collateral on a discounted basis.  If the net collateral value is less than the loan balance (including accrued interest and any unamortized premium or discount   
     
 55   

Table of Contents   
     
   associated with the loan) we recognize    an impairment and establish a specific reserve for the impaired loan. Because of the limited number of impaired loans within the portfolio, we are able to evaluate each impaired loan individually and therefore specific reserves for impaired loans are generally less than those recommended by the listed regulatory guidelines above. 
     
  The general component relates to groups of homogeneous loans not designated for a specific allowance and are collectively evaluated for impairment. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. To arrive at the general component, the loan portfolio is grouped by loan type. A weighted average historical loss rate is computed for each group of loans over the trailing seven year period.   We selected a seven year evaluation period as a result of the limited historical loss experience we have incurred, even during the recent economic downturn.  We also believe that a seven year time horizon represents a full economic cycle.  The historical loss factors are updated at least annually, unless a more frequent review of such factors is warranted.  In addition to the use of historical loss factors, a qualitative adjustment factor is applied. This qualitative adjustment factor, which may be favorable or unfavorable, represents management s judgment that inherent losses in a given group of loans are different from historical loss rates due to environmental factors unique to that specific group of loans. These factors may relate to growth rate factors within the particular loan group; whether the recent loss history for a particular group of loans differs from its historical loss rate; the amount of loans in a particular group that have recently been designated as impaired and that may be indicative of future trends for this group; reported or observed difficulties that other banks are having with loans in the particular group; changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending personnel; changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio and in the terms of loans; and changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, nonaccrual loans, and adversely classified loans. The sum of the historical loss rate and the qualitative adjustment factor comprise the estimated annual loss rate. To adjust for inherent loss levels within the loan portfolio, a loss emergence factor is estimated based on an evaluation of the period of time it takes for a loan within each of our loan segments to deteriorate to the point an impairment loss is recorded within the allowance.  The loss emergence factor is applied to the estimated annual loss rate to determine the expected annual loss amount.  
     
  Credit losses are an inherent part of our business and, although we believe the methodologies for determining the allowance for loan losses and the current level of the allowance are appropriate, it is possible that there may be unidentified losses in the portfolio at any particular time that may become evident at a future date pursuant to additional internal analysis or regulatory comment.  Additional provisions for such losses, if necessary, would be recorded in the commercial banking or mortgage banking segments, as appropriate, and would negatively impact earnings.  
     
   Allowance for Loan Losses - Acquired Loans   
     
   Acquired loans accounted for under ASC 310-30   
     
  For our acquired loans, to the extent that we experience a deterioration in borrower credit quality resulting in a decrease in our expected cash flows subsequent to the acquisition of the loans, an allowance for loan losses would be established based on our estimate of future credit losses over the remaining life of the loans.  
     
   Acquired loans accounted for under ASC 310-20   
     
  Subsequent to the acquisition date, we establish our allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation process that is similar to our evaluation process used for originated loans. This evaluation, which includes a review of loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers, among other factors, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical net loan loss experience, carrying value of the loans, which includes the remaining net purchase discount or premium, and other factors that warrant recognition in determining our allowance for loan losses.  
     
   Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans   
     
  Purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, which are the loans acquired in our acquisition of UFBC, are loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit quality). These loans are initially recorded at fair value (as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows) with no allowance for loan losses. We account for interest   
     
 56   

Table of Contents   
     
   income on all loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit quality) based on the acquired loans  expected    cash flows. The acquired loans may be aggregated and accounted for as a pool of loans if the loans being aggregated have common risk characteristics. A pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flow. The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the investment in the loans, or the  accretable yield,  is recognized as interest income utilizing the level-yield method over the life of each pool. Increases in expected cash flows subsequent to the acquisition are recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield on the pool over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a loss provision and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Therefore, the allowance for loan losses on these impaired pools reflect only losses incurred after the acquisition (representing the present value of all cash flows that were expected at acquisition but currently are not expected to be received).  At September 30, 2016, there was no reserve for impairment of PCI loans within our allowance for loan losses. 
     
  We periodically evaluate the remaining contractual required payments due and estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. Changes in the contractual required payments due and estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and non-accretable difference or reclassifications between accretable yield and the non-accretable difference. On an aggregate basis, if the acquired pools of PCI loans perform better than originally expected, we would expect to receive more future cash flows than originally modeled at the acquisition date. For the pools with better than expected cash flows, the forecasted increase would be recorded as an additional accretable yield that is recognized as a prospective increase to our interest income on loans.  
     
   Fair Value Measurements   
     
  We determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.  Our investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using reliable and unbiased valuations by an industry-wide valuation service.  This service uses evaluated pricing models that vary based on asset class and include available trade, bid, and other market information.  Generally, the methodology includes broker quotes, proprietary models, vast descriptive terms and conditions databases, as well as extensive quality control programs.  
     
  We also fair value our interest rate lock commitments, forward loan sales commitments, and mortgage-backed securities used to hedge our interest rate lock commitments and certain loans held for sale.  The fair value of our interest rate lock commitments considers the expected premium (discount) to par and we apply certain fallout rates for those rate lock commitments for which we do not close a mortgage loan.  In addition, we calculate the effects of the changes in interest rates from the date of the commitment through loan origination, and then period end, using applicable published mortgage-backed investment security prices for fixed rate loan products and investor indicated pricing for adjustable rate products.  The fair value of the forward sales contracts to investors and mortgage-backed securities considers the market price movement of the same type of security between the trade date and the balance sheet date.  
     
  We sell mortgage loans on either a best efforts or mandatory delivery basis.  Loans held for sale that are delivered on a best efforts basis are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.  For loans sold on a mandatory delivery basis, we have elected to record these loans at fair value using valuations from investors for loans with similar characteristics which is then adjusted for GMM s actual sales experience versus the investor s indicated pricing.  
     
   Accounting for Economic Hedging Activities   
     
  We record all derivative instruments on the statement of condition at their fair values .  We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. For derivatives designated as hedges, we contemporaneously document the hedging relationship, including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, how effectiveness will be assessed at inception and at each reporting period and the method for measuring ineffectiveness.  We evaluate the effectiveness of these transactions at inception and on an ongoing basis.  Ineffectiveness is recorded through earnings.  For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, except for the ineffective portion which is recorded in earnings.  
     
 57   

Table of Contents   
     
  We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective. In situations in which cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, we continue to carry the derivative at its fair value on the statement of condition and recognize any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings over the term of the forecasted transaction. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, we recognize immediately in earnings any gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income.  
     
  In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual commitments, including rate lock commitments, to finance residential mortgage loans. These commitments, which contain fixed expiration dates, offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the time frame established by us. Interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor. Loan commitments related to residential mortgage loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives and are marked to market through earnings.  
     
  To mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments, we economically hedge our commitments by entering into either a forward loan sales contract under best efforts or a trade of mortgage  backed securities for mandatory delivery (the  residual hedge ). During the rate lock commitment period, these forward loan sales contracts and the residual hedge are marked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges. Exclusive of the fair value elements of the rate lock commitment related to servicing and the wholesale and retail rate spread, the changes in fair value related to movements in market rates of the rate lock commitments and the forward loan sales contracts and residual hedge generally move in opposite directions, and the net impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential. At the closing of the loan, the loan commitment derivative expires and we record a loan held for sale and continue to be obligated under the same forward loan sales contract under best efforts.  Loans held for sale that are delivered on a best efforts basis are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.  For mandatory delivery, we close out of the trading mortgage-backed securities assigned within the residual hedge and replace them with a forward sales contract once a price has been accepted by an investor.  For loans sold on a mandatory delivery basis, we have elected to record these loans at fair value using valuations from investors for loans with similar characteristics which is then adjusted for GMM s actual sales experience versus the investor s indicated pricing.  
     
   Accounting for Impairment Testing of Goodwill   
     
  We test goodwill for impairment pursuant to ASU 2011-08,  Testing Goodwill for Impairment.   This ASU permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it need not perform the two-step impairment test. We perform our annual review of goodwill during the third quarter.  
     
  In the event we are required to perform a Step 1 fair value evaluation of the reporting unit, we make estimates of the discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the reporting unit. This discounted cash flow analysis involves the use of unobservable inputs including:  estimated future cash flows from operations; an estimate of a terminal value; a discount rate; and other inputs.  Our estimated future cash flows are largely based on our historical actual cash flows.  If the analysis indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we do an analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized.  
     
   New Financial Accounting Standards   
     
  In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date .  The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December   
     
 58   

Table of Contents   
     
   15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual    reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. All other entities may apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities also may apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning one year after the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-14 (or ASU 2014-09) to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
     
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities .  The amendments in ASU 2016-01, among other things: 1) Requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. 2) Requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. 3) Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables). 4) Eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-01 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . Among other things, in the amendments in ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) A lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and  Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach.

  During March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shares-Based Payment Accounting . The amendments in this ASU simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  During June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The amendments in this ASU, among other things, require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and

   purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The amendments in this ASU are effective for SEC filers for fiscal    years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
     
  During August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If retrospective application is impractical for some of the issues addressed by the update, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
   2016 Economic Environment   
     
  The banking environment and the markets in which we conduct our businesses will continue to be strongly influenced by developments in the U.S. and global economies, as well as the continued implementation of rulemaking from recent financial reforms.  Although global economic conditions remain unsettled, the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area, the region in which we operate, continues to perform relatively well compared to other regions.  Although we believe that our region has weathered the recession better than most over the past several years, a protracted low interest rate environment, and the burden of regulatory requirements enacted in response to the recent financial crisis make for a challenging operating environment.  We continue to consider future potential economic events and their impact on our performance.  
     
  Our credit quality continues to remain strong.  At September 30, 2016, we had no loans on nonaccrual and no loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest and still accruing.  We recorded annualized net recoveries of 0.01% of our average loans receivable for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  Market illiquidity and concerns over credit risk continue to impact the ratings of our pooled trust preferred securities. We hold investments of $3.8 million in par value of pooled trust preferred securities, which are below book value as of September 30, 2016 due to the lack of liquidity in the market, deferrals and defaults of issuers, and continued investor apprehension for investing in these types of investments.  
     
  We expect challenging economic and operating conditions and an evolving regulatory regime to continue for the foreseeable future.  These conditions could continue to affect the markets in which we do business and could adversely impact our results for 2016. The degree of the impact is dependent upon the duration and severity of the aforementioned conditions and the nature of new banking regulations.  
     
  While our loan growth has continued to be strong, continued uncertainty and sluggish economic growth could adversely affect our loan portfolio, including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which would adversely impact our charge-offs and provision for loan losses.  Deterioration in real estate values and household incomes may also result in higher credit losses for us.  Also, in the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry, counterparty, borrower or issuer.  A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially. The systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities and industries also may not function as we have anticipated.  
     
  Liquidity is essential to our business.  The primary sources of funding for our Bank include customer deposits and wholesale funding.  Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen outflows of cash, including deposits.  This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as general market disruption, negative views about the financial services industry generally, or an operational problem that affects a third party or us.  Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events.  While we believe we have a healthy liquidity position, any of the above factors could materially impact our liquidity position in the future.

   The U.S. government continues to enact legislation and develop various programs and initiatives designed to regulate the financial services industry.  The banking industry    is awaiting many of the regulations resulting from the implementation of the Financial Reform Act.  We remain unsure of the full impact this legislation will have on our business, operations, or our financial condition. 
     
   Statements of Income   
     
   General   
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we reported net income of $12.5 million and $11.2 million, respectively, an increase of $1.3 million, or 12%.  Net interest income after the provision for loan losses increased $1.8 million to $32.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $30.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Provision for loan losses recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $990,000, compared to a recovery of provision of $547,000 for the same period of 2015.  Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $17.5 million and $10.3 million, respectively, an increase of $7.2 million.  This increase was primarily due to an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities of $7.5 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same 2015 period.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense increased to $30.3 million, compared to $24.0 million for the same period of 2015.  The increase in noninterest expense is partially attributable to an increase in salary and benefits expense, a result of an increase in the variable components of our compensation and additional staffing on both the sales and operational areas of the Company over the past year as a result of our continued growth and increased regulatory environment.  In addition, we recorded merger and acquisition expenses of $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the aforementioned merger with United.  
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.38 and $0.37, respectively.  Basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were each $0.34.  Weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 33,767,143 and 33,311,261, respectively.  
     
  Return on average assets for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 1.19% and 1.20%, respectively. Return on average equity for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 11.10% and 11.02%, respectively.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we reported net income of $39.7 million and $38.3 million, respectively.  Net interest income after the provision for loan losses increased $8.5 million to $93.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $85.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Provision for loan losses recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.7 million, compared to provision expense of $939,000 for the same period of 2015.  Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $53.2 million and $43.6 million, respectively, an increase of $9.6 million.  This increase was primarily due to an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities of $9.7 million for 2016 compared to the same 2015 period.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense increased to $86.7 million, compared to $71.0 million for the same period of 2015.  The increase in noninterest expense is primarily attributable to an increase in salary and benefits expense, a result of an increase in the variable components of our compensation and additional staffing on both the sales and operational areas of the Company over the past year as a result of our continued growth and increased regulatory environment.  
     
  During the second quarter of 2016, we executed a balance sheet restructuring which we expect to enhance net interest income.  As a result of the restructuring, we incurred $3.6 million of prepayment penalties related to extinguishment of FHLB advances totaling $95 million.  As part of the restructuring, we sold $50 million in investment securities available-for-sale and recorded gains of $3.6 million.  This restructuring had minimal impact on interest rate risk and no impact to regulatory capital ratios.  The 2015 period did not have any debt extinguishment losses and we realized gains on sales of investment securities available-for-sale of $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, basic and diluted earnings per common share were $1.20 and $1.18, respectively.  Basic and diluted earnings per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $1.17 and $1.15, respectively.  Weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 33,576,873 and 33,191,915, respectively.  
     
  Return on average assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 1.29% and 1.43%, respectively. Return on average equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 12.11% and 12.81%, respectively.  
     
   General  Business Segments   
     
  We operate in three business segments: commercial banking, mortgage banking, and wealth management services.  
     
  Net income attributable to the commercial banking segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $11.5 million compared to net income of $11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Net interest income increased $3.8 million to $33.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $29.1 million for the same period of 2015.  Provision for loan losses was $990,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a provision benefit of $547,000 for the same period of 2015.  Noninterest income was $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Noninterest expense was $15.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $15.3 million for the same period of 2015.  
     
  Net income attributable to the commercial banking segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $32.5 million compared to net income of $29.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Net interest income increased $10.3 million to $95.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $84.6 million for the same period of 2015.  Provision for loan losses was $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a provision of $939,000 for the same period of 2015.  Noninterest income increased to $7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as a result of gains recorded for the sales of investment securities available-for-sale of $3.6 million during 2016.  Noninterest expense was $51.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $44.2 million for the same period of 2015.  The increase in noninterest expense was primarily attributable to increases in staffing and the variable component of our compensation at the Bank in addition to the aforementioned debt prepayment penalty of $3.6 million during 2016.  
     
  The mortgage banking segment reported net income of $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $631,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Realized and unrealized gains associated with the fair value of loan commitments and loans held for sale increased to $15.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $8.1 million for the same period of 2015, a result of an increase in the volume of loans sold and gain on sale margins.  Noninterest expense increased $3.6 million to $11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $7.9 million for the same period of 2015.  The increase in noninterest expense is attributable to the adoption of fair value option for loans sold on a mandatory delivery basis as we no longer defer and record expenses related to the origination of mandatory loans net of realized gains on mortgage banking activities.  
     
  The mortgage banking segment reported net income of $10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Realized and unrealized gains associated with the fair value of loan commitments and loans held for sale increased to $45.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $35.4 million for the same period of 2015, a result of an increase in the volume of loans sold and gain on sale margins.  Noninterest expense increased $6.6 million to $29.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $23.2 million for the same period of 2015.  The increase in non-interest expense is primarily related to expenses attributable to loan volumes (overtime, application processing and closing  
     
 62

  expenses) in addition to increased personnel expenses related to compliance with the new TILA/RESPA Integrated Disclosure ( TRID ) regulations.  
     
  The wealth management services segment, which includes CWS, recorded no net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $12,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
  The wealth management services segment, which includes CWS, recorded net income of $62,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $17,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Net Interest Income   
     
  Net interest income is our primary source of revenue, representing the difference between interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is affected primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as changes in interest rates. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net interest income was $33.0 million and $29.6 million, respectively.  The yields on our loans receivable portfolio decreased 7 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 as a result of the low interest rate environment.  The yield on our loans held for sale portfolio decreased 32 basis points, which is again due to the low interest rate environment.  The yields on our interest-bearing deposits remained at 0.75% as we have maintained rates on our deposit product offering again due to the low interest rate environment.  Other borrowed funds costs decreased by 63 basis points primarily due to our prepaying a portion of our fixed rate FHLB advance portfolio during the second quarter of 2016 to help reduce our funding costs.  This restructuring is expected to positively impact net interest margin by approximately 0.06% annualized which began during the third quarter of 2016.  
     
  Our net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets, was 3.35% and 3.37% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Our net interest margin decreased as a result of the decrease in yield on our interest-earning assets due to the low interest rate environment.  
     
  Interest income on loans receivable increased $3.3 million to $32.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $29.0 million for the same three month period of 2015.  The increase in interest income on loans receivable is primarily a result of the increase in the volume of the loans receivable portfolio.  Interest income on loans held for sale was $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $3.6 million for the same period of 2015.  
     
  Interest income on investment securities and other investments decreased $87,000 to $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
  Total interest expense increased $115,000 to $6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6.2 million for the same period of 2015.  The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in deposits, specifically certificates of deposit, over the past year.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net interest income was $95.2 million and $85.9 million, respectively.  The yields on our loans receivable portfolio decreased 12 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 as a result of the low interest rate environment.  The yields on our interest-bearing deposits increased 3 basis points as we have increased rates on certain savings and certificates of deposit products to remain competitive in our market in the past year, offset by reducing our rates on our interest checking products and costs related to other borrowed funds.  Other borrowed funds costs decreased by 41 basis points primarily due to restructurings of our FHLB advance portfolio during 2015 and 2016.  
     
  Our net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.32% and 3.40% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Our net interest margin decreased as a result of the decrease in yield on our interest-earning assets due to the low interest rate environment.

   Interest income on loans receivable increased $10.2 million to $94.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $84.5 million for the same nine month period of 2015.  The increase in interest income    on loans receivable is primarily a result of the increase in the volume of the loans receivable portfolio.  Interest income on loans held for sale was $10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $10.0 million for the same period of 2015. 
     
  Interest income on investment securities and other investments increased $882,000 to $9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest income in our investment securities portfolio is attributable to purchases of securities that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of 2015.  
     
  Total interest expense increased $2.1 million to $19.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $17.5 million for the same period of 2015.  The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in deposits, specifically certificates of deposit, over the past year.

   Provision for Loan Losses   
     
  The provision for (recovery of) loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $990,000 and ($547,000), respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, provision for loan losses was $1.7 million and $939,000, respectively.  The increase in our provision expense during 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily a result of an increase in outstanding loans in our portfolio.  
     
    The allowance for loan losses was $33.6 million at September 30, 2016 and $31.7 million at December 31, 2015. Our allowance for loan losses ratio as a percent of total loans was 1.04% at each of the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  During 2016, we recorded charge-offs of $471,000 primarily related to commercial and residential loans.  Recoveries from previously charged-off loans totaled $719,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  During 2016, we received recoveries on three commercial relationships totaling $600,000.  Nonperforming loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were $0 and $451,000, respectively. The decrease in nonperforming loans is primarily a result of one nonperforming loan paying off in total during 2016.  
     
  A sluggish job market or a decline in home values could adversely affect our home equity lines of credit, credit card and other loan portfolios, including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which we expect could impact our charge-offs and provision for loan losses.  Deterioration in commercial and residential real estate values, employment data and household incomes may also result in higher credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio.  Also, in the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry, counterparty, borrower or issuer.  At September 30, 2016, our commercial real estate (including construction lending) portfolio was 70% of our total loan portfolio.  A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities and industries may not function as we have anticipated.

   Noninterest Income   
     
  Noninterest income includes service charges on deposits and loans, realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities, investment fee income, and gains on sales of investment securities available-for-sale, and continues to be an important factor in our operating results.  
     
  Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $17.5 million and $10.3 million, respectively. Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $53.2 million and $43.6 million, respectively.   Realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities, which are reported net of commission   incentive expense and typically the largest portion of our non-interest income, totaled $15.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $8.1 million for the same period of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities were $45.1 million and $35.4 million, respectively.  
     
  The change in net gains from mortgage banking activities is mainly due to changes in the unrealized gains associated with the fair value of our locked commitments and closed loans held for sale.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, unrealized gains were $32.0 million, compared to $22.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, unrealized gains were $93.7 million, compared to $75.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  In accordance with GAAP, if a lender enters into a mortgage loan commitment with a customer and intends to sell the mortgage loan after it is funded, the written loan commitment is to be accounted for as a derivative instrument and is to be recorded at fair value, which represents an unrealized gain that is included in earnings.  This gain is also recognized earlier in earnings than the expenses associated with originating, underwriting and closing the loan.  When the loan actually closes, the unrealized gain is added to the basis of the ensuing loan held for sale (LHFS).  At any point in time (e.g. quarter end) the fair value of the existing loan commitments and the premium to the basis of existing LHFS (loans closed but not yet purchased by investors) represent unrealized gains that have been recognized in income, either in the current period or prior periods.  At the time the loan is sold to investors, the  investor buy price  is equal to the basis of the loan held for sale, and there is no gain or loss recognized.  This accounting creates a mismatch between the income recognition on loan production and the expense recognition for those same loans.  
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we closed $1.20 billion and $885.7 million in mortgage originations, respectively.  The increase in mortgage originations is a result of a slight increase in refinance activity for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015.   Refinance activity increased to 35% of our total loan origination volume for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 26% for the same period of 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we closed $3.14 billion and $2.82 billion in mortgage originations, respectively.  
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded net realized gains on investment securities available-for-sale of $0 and $769,000, respectively.  During the second quarter of 2016, we sold $50.0 million in investment securities available-for-sale as part of a balance sheet restructuring.  As a result, we recorded gains on available-for-sale securities of $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.2 million for the same period of 2015.  
     
  Investment fee income decreased to $94,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $142,000 for the same period of 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, investment fee income was $263,000 and $400,000, respectively.  
     
  The increase in the cash surrender value of our bank-owned life insurance for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $101,000 and $118,000, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the increase in the cash surrender value of our bank-owned life insurance was $336,000 and $330,000, respectively.

  During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a litigation settlement of $3.0 million which contributed to noninterest income for 2015.  
     
  Noninterest income represented 35% and 26% of our total revenues (defined as net interest income plus noninterest income) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, noninterest income represented 36% and 34% of our total revenues, respectively.  
     
   Noninterest Expense   
     
  Noninterest expense includes, among other things, salaries and benefits, occupancy costs, professional fees, depreciation, data processing, telecommunications and miscellaneous expenses. Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $30.3 million, compared to $24.0 million for the same period of 2015, an increase of $6.3 million, or 26%.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, noninterest expense was $86.7 million and $71.0 million, respectively, an increase of $15.7 million.  The increase is a result of an increase in salaries and benefits expense, a result of an increase in the variable components or our compensation and additional staffing on both the sales and operational areas of the Company over the past year as a result of our continued growth and increased regulatory environment.  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, salaries and benefits expense increased to $17.3 million from $13.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, salaries and benefits expense was $48.9 million and $37.5 million, respectively.  
     
  Noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes $2.3 million in merger and acquisition expenses related to the aforementioned merger with United.  Additionally, during 2016, we recorded a repayment penalty of $3.6 million.  
     
  Occupancy expense was $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.5 million for the same period of 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, occupancy expense was $7.6 million and $7.3 million, respectively.  
     
  Professional fees were $727,000 and $852,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, professional fees expense was $2.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively.  The decrease in professional fees for 2016 was a result of increased legal fees recorded during 2015 as a result of litigation which was settled during the second quarter of 2015.  
     
   Income Taxes   
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $6.6 million, compared to $5.2 million for the same period of 2015.  Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 34.6% and 33.9%, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $20.3 million and $19.2 million, respectively.  Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 33.9% and 33.4%, respectively.  Our effective tax rate is less than the statutory rate because of income we receive on tax-exempt investments.  See also  Critical Accounting Policies   Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets.

   Investment Securities   
     
  Our investment securities portfolio is used as a source of income and liquidity.  Investment securities were $397.9 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $423.8 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $25.9 million.  The decrease in investment securities was a result of sales, maturities, calls, and scheduled principal payments.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we sold $50.7 million in available-for-sale investment securities and recorded associated gains of $3.6 million as part of the balance sheet restructuring that occurred.  We purchased $73.1 million in

Table of Contents   
     
  available-for-sale investment securities to replace what was sold and the maturities and calls that have occurred during 2016.  The investment securities portfolio consists of investment securities available-for-sale, investment securities held-to-maturity and trading securities. Investment securities available-for-sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily until maturity. These securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset/liability strategy, liquidity management or regulatory capital management.  Investment securities held-to-maturity are those securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Investment securities-trading are securities we purchase to economically hedge against fair value changes in our nonqualified deferred compensation plan liability.  These securities include cash equivalents, equities and mutual funds.  See the following table for additional information on our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities portfolios.

  We complete reviews for other-than-temporary impairment at least quarterly.  As of September 30, 2016, the majority of our investment securities portfolio consisted of securities rated AAA by a leading rating agency.  Investment securities which carry a AAA rating are judged to be of the best quality and carry the smallest degree of investment risk.  At September 30, 2016, 99% of our mortgage-related investment securities portfolio is guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA).  
     
  At September 30, 2016, certain of our investment grade securities were in an unrealized loss position.  Investment securities with unrealized losses are a result of pricing changes in the current market environment and not as a result of permanent credit impairment. Contractual cash flows for the agency mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed and/or funded by the U.S. government.  Other mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities have third party protective elements and there are no negative indications that the contractual cash flows will not be received when due.  We do not intend to sell nor do we believe we will be required to sell any of our temporarily impaired securities prior to the recovery of their amortized cost.  
     
  No other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized for the securities in our investment portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  We hold $15.3 million in FHLB stock at September 30, 2016, which is included in other investments on the statement of condition.

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $59.4 million and $67.0 million, respectively, in CDARS deposits, which are considered to be brokered deposits.  Brokered certificates of deposit not in the CDARS network were $387.7 million and $340.0 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We use this type of funding to lock in low cost term funding to support mortgage loans we originate and intend to sell.

The increase in shareholders  equity at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to net income of $39.7 million recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 less dividends of $11.7 million that were declared during 2016.  In addition, accumulated other comprehensive income increased $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

   Business Segment Operations   
     
  We provide banking and non-banking financial services and products through our subsidiaries. We operate in three business segments, commercial banking, mortgage banking and wealth management services.  
     
   Commercial Banking   
     
  The commercial banking segment includes both commercial and consumer lending and provides customers such products as commercial loans, real estate loans, and other business financing and consumer loans. In addition, this segment also provides customers with various deposit products including demand deposit accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit.  
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the commercial banking segment recorded net income of $11.5 million compared to $11.0 million for the same period of 2015.

   Wealth Management Services   
     
  The wealth management services segment provides investment and financial services to businesses and individuals, including financial planning, retirement/estate planning, and investment management.  
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the wealth management services segment recorded net income of $0 and $12,000, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the wealth management services segment reported net income of $62,000 and $17,000, respectively.

At September 30, 2015, total assets were $2.4 million and managed and custodial assets were $267 million.  
     
  Additional information pertaining to our business segments can be found in Note 3 to the notes to consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Capital Resources   
     
  Capital adequacy is an important measure of our financial stability and performance. Our objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to sustain asset growth and promote depositor and investor confidence.  
     
  Regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy utilizing a formula that takes into account the individual risk profile of the financial institution. On January 1, 2015, the new Basel III regulatory risk-based capital rules became effective.  Basel III includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and refines the definition of what constitutes  capital  for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 ( CET1 ) capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%, which is increased from 4%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%, which is unchanged from the former rules; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.  
     
  Beginning January 1, 2016, a capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and is applicable to our CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios. Including the conservation buffer, we consider our new minimum capital ratios to be as follows: 5.125% for CET1; 6.625% for Tier 1 capital; and 8.625% for Total capital.  Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.  
     
  This new regulatory standard also provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets related to temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.  
     
 79   

Table of Contents   
     
  Basel III prescribes a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.  
     
  Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 12.11% at September 30, 2016 compared to 11.37% at December 31, 2015.  Our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.23% at September 30, 2016 compared to 10.52% at December 31, 2015.  Common equity Tier 1 capital was 10.58% at September 30, 2016 compared to 9.86% at December 31, 2015.  
     
  Accordingly, our regulatory capital levels for the Bank and bank holding company meet those established for well-capitalized institutions at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  The following table shows the minimum capital requirements and our capital position at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for the Company and for the Bank.

Liquidity   
     
  Liquidity in the banking industry is defined as the ability to meet the demand for funds of both depositors and borrowers. We must be able to meet these needs by obtaining funding from depositors or other lenders or by converting non-cash items into cash.  The objective of our liquidity management program is to ensure that we always have sufficient resources to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers. Stable core deposits and a strong capital position provide the base for our liquidity position. We believe we have demonstrated our ability to attract deposits because of our convenient branch locations, personal service and pricing.  
     
  In addition to deposits, we have access to different wholesale funding markets. These markets include the brokered CD market, the repurchase agreement market and the federal funds market. We are a member of the Certificates of Deposit Account Registry Service ( CDARS ).  CDARS allows our customers to access FDIC insurance protection on multi-million dollar certificates of deposit through our Bank.  When a customer places a large deposit through CDARS, we place their funds into certificates of deposit with other banks in the CDARS network in increments of less than $250,000 so that principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance protection.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $59.4 million and $67.0 million, respectively, in CDARS deposits, which are considered to be brokered deposits.  Brokered certificates of deposit not in the CDARS network were $387.7 million and $340.0 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
     
  We also maintain secured lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( FHLB ) for which we can borrow up to the allowable amount for the collateral pledged. Having diverse funding alternatives reduces our reliance on any one source for funding.  
     
 80   

Table of Contents   
     
  Cash flow from amortizing assets or maturing assets can also provide funding to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers.  
     
  We have established a formal liquidity contingency plan which establishes a liquidity management team and provides guidelines for liquidity management. For our liquidity management program, we first determine our current liquidity position and then forecast liquidity based on anticipated changes in the balance sheet. In this forecast, we expect to maintain a liquidity cushion. We also stress test our liquidity position under several different stress scenarios, from moderate to severe. Guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established. We believe that we have sufficient resources to meet our liquidity needs.  
     
  Liquid assets, which include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale, totaled $434.6 million at September 30, 2016 or 10.3% of total assets. To maintain ready access to the Bank s secured lines of credit, the Bank has pledged a portion of its investment securities and a portion of its commercial real estate and residential real estate loan portfolios to the FHLB with additional investment securities and certain loans in its commercial   industrial loan portfolio pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Additional borrowing capacity at the FHLB at September 30, 2016 was approximately $761.3 million. Borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was $180.3 million at September 30, 2016. These facilities are subject to the FHLB and the Federal Reserve approving disbursement to us.  In addition, we have unsecured federal funds purchased lines of $315 million available to us.  We anticipate maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors, provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements.  
     
   Contractual Obligations   
     
  We have entered into a number of long-term contractual obligations to support our ongoing activities. These contractual obligations will be funded through operating revenues and liquidity sources held or available to us and exclude contractual interest costs, where applicable.  
     
  The required payments under such obligations are detailed in the following table.  
     
   Contractual Obligations   
  At September 30, 2016  
  (In thousands)  

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Credit Risk   
     
  We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet.  
     
  The Bank s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. We evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis and require collateral to support financial instruments when deemed necessary.  The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty.  Collateral held varies but may include deposits held by us, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.  
     
  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates up to one year or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. These instruments represent obligations to extend credit or guarantee borrowings and are not recorded on the consolidated statements of condition.  The rates and terms of these instruments are competitive with others in the market in which we do business.  
     
 81   

Table of Contents   
     
  Unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers.  Those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we have committed.  
     
  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. We hold certificates of deposit, deposit accounts, and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary.  
     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, commitments to extend credit were $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.  Standby letters of credit were $35.5 million and $32.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, commitments to extend credit of $411.2 million at September 30, 2016 were related to the mortgage banking segment s mortgage loan funding commitments and are of a short term nature, compared to $247.4 million at December 31, 2015.  The increase in mortgage loan funding commitments is related to the increased origination production at George Mason during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.  
     
  We have counter-party risk which may arise from the possible inability of George Mason s third-party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts. George Mason works with third-party investors that are generally well-capitalized, are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk.  We continuously monitor the financial condition of these third parties.  We do not expect these third parties to fail to meet their obligations.  
     
  George Mason provides for its estimated exposure to repurchase loans previously sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor, and for other exposure to its investors related to loan sales activities. We evaluate the merits of each claim and estimate the reserve based on actual and expected claims received and consider the historical amounts paid to settle such claims.  We have taken steps to limit our exposure to such loan repurchases through agreements entered into with various investors.  As a result, we receive a limited number of additional claims.  
     
   Interest Rate Sensitivity   
     
  We are exposed to various business risks including interest rate risk. Our goal is to maximize net interest income without incurring excessive interest rate risk. Management of net interest income and interest rate risk must be consistent with the level of capital and liquidity that we maintain. We manage interest rate risk through an asset and liability committee ( ALCO ). ALCO is responsible for managing our interest rate risk in conjunction with liquidity and capital management.  
     
  We employ an independent consulting firm to model our interest rate sensitivity.  We use a net interest income simulation model as our primary tool to measure interest rate sensitivity. Many assumptions are developed based on expected activity in the balance sheet. For maturing assets, assumptions are created for the redeployment of these assets. For maturing liabilities, assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources. Assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that could reprice during the modeled time period. These assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non-maturity deposits such as interest checking, money market checking, and savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit. Based on inputs that include the current balance sheet, the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions, the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that market rates remain unchanged. This is considered the base case. Next, the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates. The rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down 100 basis points and up 200 basis points. The down 200 basis point scenario was discontinued given the current level of interest rates.  In the ramped down rate change, the model moves rates gradually down 100 basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year.  
     
  For the up 200 basis point scenario, rates are gradually moved up 200 basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year. In both the up and down scenarios, the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. The results of these simulations are then compared to the base case.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, our asset/liability position was slightly asset sensitive based on our interest rate sensitivity model.  Our net interest income would decrease by less than 1.3% in a down 100 basis point scenario and would increase by less than 0.5% in an up 200 basis point scenario over a one-year time frame.  In the two-year time horizon, our net interest income would decrease by less than 2.5% in a down 100 basis point scenario and would increase less than 0.7% in an up 200 basis point scenario.

   Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     
     
  Our Asset/Liability Committee is responsible for reviewing our liquidity requirements and maximizing our net interest income consistent with capital requirements, liquidity, interest rate and economic outlooks, competitive factors and customer needs. Interest rate risk arises because the assets of the Bank and the liabilities of the Bank have different maturities and characteristics. In order to measure this interest rate risk, we use a simulation process that measures the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income. This model is run for the Bank by an independent consulting firm. The simulations incorporate assumptions related to expected activity in the balance sheet. For maturing assets, assumptions are developed for the redeployment of these assets. For maturing liabilities, assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources. Assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that reprice during the modeled time period. These assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non-maturity deposits such as interest checking, money market checking, and savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit. Based on inputs that include the most recent period end balance sheet, the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions, the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that interest rates remain unchanged. This becomes the base case. Next, the model determines the impact on net interest income given specified changes in interest rates. The rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down 100 basis points and up 200 basis points. The down 200 basis point scenario was discontinued given the current level of interest rates.  In the ramped down rate change, the model moves rates gradually down 100 basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year.  
     
  For the up 200 basis point scenario, rates are gradually increased by 200 basis points in the first year and remain flat in the second year. In both the up and down scenarios, the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. The results of these simulations are then compared to the base case.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, our asset/liability position was slightly asset sensitive based on our interest rate sensitivity model.  Our net interest income would decrease by less than 1.3% in a down 100 basis point scenario and would increase by less than 0.5% in an up 200 basis point scenario over a one-year time frame.  In the two-year time horizon, our net interest income would decrease by less than 2.5% in a down 100 basis point scenario and would increase less than 0.7% in an up 200 basis point scenario.  
     
  See also  Interest Rate Sensitivity  in Item 2 above for a discussion of our interest rate risk.  
     
  We have counter-party risk that may arise from the possible inability of George Mason s third party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts.  George Mason works with third-party investors that are generally well-capitalized, are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk.  We monitor the financial condition of these third parties on an annual basis.  We do not expect any third-party investor to fail to meet its obligation.

     Item 4.  Controls and Procedures   
     
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a   15(e) under the Exchange Act).  As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based on and as of the date of such evaluation, these officers concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  
     
  The Company also maintains a system of internal accounting controls that is designed to provide assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are executed in accordance with management s authorization and are properly recorded. This system is continually reviewed and is augmented by written policies and procedures, the careful selection and training of qualified personnel and an internal audit program to monitor its effectiveness. Except as described below, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
     
   Remediation Plan for Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
     
  For the period ended December 31, 2015, we disclosed a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described in our 2015 Form 10-K, related to the process of estimating the allowance for loan losses.  In response to this material weakness, the Company implemented changes to its internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, including changes to the allowance for loan losses process owners and control operators. The Company also implemented a new model to use in its calculation of the allowance for loan losses which prevents the use of loss factors that are not in accordance with the approved allowance for loan losses policy.  The Company concluded that the material weakness has been fully remediated as of September 30, 2016.

   PART II   OTHER INFORMATION     
     
   Item 1.  Legal Proceedings     
     
  In the ordinary course of our operations, we become party to various legal proceedings.  Currently, we are not party to any material legal proceedings, and no such proceedings except as noted above are, to management s knowledge, threatened against us.  
     
   Item 1A.  Risk Factors     
     
  Our operations are subject to many risks that could adversely affect our future financial condition and performance and, therefore, the market value of our securities, including the risk factors that are outlined in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Except as described below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Form 10-K.  
     
  As a result of our announcement of our decision to merge with United Bankshares, Inc., we may be subject to the additional risk factors below.  
     
    Risks Related to the Merger with United Bankshares, Inc. ( United )    
     
   Termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact us.   
     
   Each of the Company s and United s obligation to consummate the Merger remains subject to a number of conditions, and there can be no assurance that all of the conditions will be satisfied, or that the Merger will be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe, or at all. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe.  If the Agreement between the Company and United (for the purposes of these Risk Factors, the  Merger Agreement ) is terminated and the parties fail to consummate the Merger, there may be various negative consequences to the Company and the Bank. For example, our businesses may have been adversely affected by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Company s board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, our shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to pay the equivalent or greater consideration than that which United has agreed to pay with respect to the Merger. In addition, under certain circumstances, the termination of the Merger Agreement may require us to pay to United a termination fee in the amount of $36.0 million.  
     
  In addition, the Company has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, we would have to recognize these expenses and would have committed substantial time and resources by our management, without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger. In addition, failure to consummate the Merger also may result in negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, vendors and employees. If the Merger is not completed, these risks may materialize and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price, business and cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  
     
   We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.   
     
  Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us and our business. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with the Company and the Bank to seek to change existing business relationships. Retention of certain employees by the Company and the Bank may be challenging while the Merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Bank. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with our organization, our business following the Merger could be harmed. In addition, we have agreed to operate our business in the ordinary course prior to closing , and the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking other specified actions until the Merger occurs without the consent of United.  These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger. 
     
   Combining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected.   
     
  United and the Company have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate independently. The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of United with ours. To realize these anticipated benefits, after the completion of the Merger, United expects to integrate our business into its own. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect United s ability to successfully conduct its business in the markets in which we now operate, which could have an adverse effect on United s financial results and the value of its common stock. If United experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated   
     
 85   

Table of Contents   
     
  benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause the Bank to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from the Bank and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts between United and the Company will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of the Company, the Bank and United during this transition period and for an undetermined period after consummation of the Merger.  
     
   Our ability to complete the Merger with UBSI is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from regulatory agencies which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the Merger to be abandoned.   
     
  Before the Merger may be completed, we must obtain various approvals or consents from the Federal Reserve Board and various bank regulatory and other authorities. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the Merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger. Although United and the Company do not currently expect that any such conditions or changes would be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of United following the Merger. There can be no assurance as to whether the regulatory approvals will be received, the timing of those approvals, or whether any conditions will be imposed.  
     
   Fluctuations in market prices of UBSI common stock will affect the value that our shareholders receive for their shares of our common stock.   
     
  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, our shareholders will receive 0.71 shares of United common stock for each share of the Company s common stock (such ratio, the  Exchange Ratio ). The market price of the United common stock may vary from its price on the date immediately prior to the public announcement of the Merger as a result of a variety of factors, including, among other things, changes in United s businesses, operations and prospects, regulatory considerations and general market and economic conditions. Many of these factors are beyond the control of United or the Company. As a result of the fixed number of shares of United common stock to be issued in the merger, the market value of the shares of United common stock that our shareholders receive in the merger will decline correspondingly with any declines in the market price of United common stock prior to and as of the date the merger consideration is paid, subject to the conditions and limitations discussed in the following paragraph.  
     
  As addressed in more detail in the Merger Agreement, we may terminate the Merger Agreement by a vote of a majority of our board of directors if (a) the average closing price per share (calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement) of United common stock is less than 0.80 of the closing price per share on the last trading day prior to publicly announcing the Merger Agreement and (b) the ratio calculated in (a) is at least 15 basis points lower than the percentage decline in the closing price of the Nasdaq Bank Index over the same period. Even if the conditions in (a) and (b) are met, however, United may adjust the Exchange Ratio as provided in the Merger Agreement to increase the consideration received by our shareholders in the Merger, and, if such adjustment is made, our right to terminate the Merger Agreement will be extinguished. Because the price of United common stock and the Nasdaq Bank Index will fluctuate prior to the Merger, and because in certain circumstances United has the right to adjust the consideration received in the Merger by our shareholders, we cannot assure our shareholders of the market value or number of shares of United common stock that they will receive in the merger.  
     
   Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds     
     
  (a)  None.  
     
  (b)  Not applicable.  
     
  (c)  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we did not purchase shares of our common stock.
