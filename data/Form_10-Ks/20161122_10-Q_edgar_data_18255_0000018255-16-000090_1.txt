FOR

  OCTOBER 29, 2016 AND OCTOBER 31, 2015        

NOTE 1 - GENERAL        :    

The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
from the accounting records of The Cato Corporation and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries (the  Company ), and all amounts shown as of and for the periods
ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 are unaudited.  In the opinion of
management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement have been
included.  All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature unless
otherwise noted.  The results of the interim period may not be indicative of
the results expected for the entire year.   

The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, included in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016. 
Amounts as of January 30, 2016 have been derived from the audited balance
sheet, but do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.   

During the first quarter of 2016, the Company determined that
there was an error in the classification of unrecognized tax benefits for
uncertain tax positions as current liabilities in Accrued income taxes that
resulted in a revision to the prior year end balance sheet as of January 30,
2016. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 30, 2016 has been
revised to correct the presentation of the amounts, which resulted in a
decrease to Accrued income taxes and a corresponding increase to Other
noncurrent liabilities of $13.6 million, which primarily consists of deferred
rent and deferred compensation liabilities. There was no impact to the
statement of income and comprehensive income and no impact to total net cash
provided by operating activities or used in investing and financing activities
in the statement of cash flows. The Company concluded that the revision was
immaterial to prior period financial statements.   

During the first quarter of 2016, the Company changed its estimate
for recognizing gift card breakage income. The Company changed the dormancy
period to 24 months of inactivity from 60 months of inactivity to more closely
align with recent Company experience, industry practice and tax treatment. As a
result, the Company recognized $2.4 million of additional breakage income
(recorded in Interest and other income in the accompanying Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income) for gift cards that
were dormant from January 30, 2011 through February 1, 2014.   

On November 17, 2016, the Board of Directors maintained the
quarterly dividend at $0.33 per share and increased, by 2 million shares, the
authorization to purchase shares under its share repurchase program.

NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE:    

Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) 260
     Earnings Per Share    requires dual presentation of basic and diluted Earnings
Per Share ( EPS ) on the face of all income statements for all entities with
complex capital structures.  The Company has presented one basic EPS and one
diluted EPS amount for all common shares in the accompanying Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  While the
Company s certificate of incorporation provides the right for the Board of
Directors to declare dividends on Class A shares without declaration of
commensurate dividends on Class B shares, the Company has historically paid the
same dividends to both Class A and Class B shareholders and the Board of
Directors has resolved to continue this practice.  Accordingly, the Company s
allocation of income for purposes of the EPS computation is the same for Class
A and Class B shares and the EPS amounts reported herein are applicable to both
Class A and Class B shares.   

Basic EPS is computed as net income less
earnings allocated to non-vested equity awards divided by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the
potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock
options and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

NOTE 4   FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS:     

As
of October 29, 2016, the Company had an unsecured revolving credit agreement to
borrow $35.0 million less the balance of any revocable letters of credit as
discussed below.  The revolving credit agreement is committed until August 2018. 
The credit agreement contains various financial covenants and limitations,
including the maintenance of specific financial ratios with which the Company
was in compliance as of October 29, 2016.  There were no borrowings outstanding
under this credit facility at October 29, 2016 or January 30, 2016.  The
weighted average interest rate under the credit facility was 1.4% at October
29, 2016.   

At
October 29, 2016 and January 30, 2016, the Company had no outstanding revocable
letters of credit relating to purchase commitments.   

NOTE 5   REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION:     

The Company has determined that it has four operating segments, as
defined under ASC 280-10, including Cato, It s Fashion, Versona and Credit.  As
outlined in ASC 280-10, the Company has two reportable segments: Retail and Credit. 
The Company has aggregated its three retail operating segments, including
e-commerce, based on the aggregation criteria outlined in ASC 280-10, which
states that two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single reportable
segment if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of
ASC 280-10, which require the segments to have similar economic
characteristics, products, production processes, clients and methods of
distribution.     

The Company s retail operating segments have similar economic
characteristics and similar operating, financial and competitive risks.  They
are similar in nature of product, as they all offer women s apparel, shoes and
accessories.  Merchandise inventory for the Company s retail operating segments
is sourced from the same countries and some of the same vendors, using similar
production processes.  Merchandise for the Company s operating segments is
distributed to retail stores in a similar manner through the Company s single
distribution center and is subsequently distributed to clients in a similar
manner.   

The Company
operates its women s fashion specialty retail stores in 33 states as of October
29, 2016, principally in the southeastern United States    . The Company offers
its own credit card to its customers and all credit authorizations, payment
processing and collection efforts are performed by a separate subsidiary of the
Company.

NOTE 6   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:     

As
of October 29, 2016, the Company had three long-term compensation plans
pursuant to which stock-based compensation was outstanding or could be granted.
The Company s 1987 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan is for the granting of
options to officers and key employees.  As of October 29, 2016, there were no
available stock options for grant. The 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan and
2004 Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan are for the granting of
various forms of equity-based awards, including restricted stock and stock
options for grant, to officers, directors and key employees. Effective May 23,
2013, shares for grant were no longer available under the 2004 Amended and
Restated Incentive Compensation Plan.   

The
following table presents the number of options and shares of restricted stock
initially authorized and available for grant under each of the plans as of
October 29, 2016:    

In accordance with ASC 718, the fair value
of current restricted stock awards is estimated on the date of grant based on
the market price of the Company s stock and is amortized to compensation
expense on a straight-line basis over the related vesting periods. As of
October 29, 2016 and January 30, 2016, there was $13,967,000 and $12,214,000,
respectively, of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested
restricted stock awards, which had a remaining weighted-average vesting period
of 2.7 years and 2.6 years, respectively. The total fair value of the shares
recognized as compensation expense during the three and nine months ended
October 29, 2016 was $1,145,000 and $2,948,000, respectively, compared to
$1,040,000 and $2,981,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended
October 31, 2015. These expenses are classified as a component of Selling,
general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Income.   

The following
summary shows the changes in the shares of unvested restricted stock
outstanding during the     nine
months ended   October 29, 2016:

The Company s
Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible full-time employees to purchase a

During the nine months ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, the Company
sold 16,071 and 15,245 shares to employees at an average discount of $5.12 and
$5.27 per share, respectively, under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The
compensation expense recognized for the 15% discount given under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan was approximately $82,000 and $80,000 for the nine months ended
October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. These expenses are
classified as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses.

assets of $6.4 million.  All of these assets are recorded within Other assets
in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

Level 1 category
securities are measured at fair value using quoted active market prices.  Level
2 investment securities include corporate and municipal bonds for which quoted
prices may not be available on active exchanges for identical instruments. 
Their fair value is principally based on market values determined by management
with assistance of a third-party pricing service.  Since quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets are not available, these prices are
determined by the pricing service using observable market information such as
quotes from less active markets and/or quoted prices of securities with similar
characteristics, among other factors.   

Deferred
compensation plan assets consist of life insurance policies. These life
insurance policies are valued based on the cash surrender value of the
insurance contract, which is determined based on such factors as the fair value
of the underlying assets and discounted cash flow and are therefore classified
within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The Level 3 liability associated
with the life insurance policies represents a deferred compensation obligation,
the value of which is tracked via underlying insurance funds. These funds are
designed to mirror existing mutual funds and money market funds that are
observable and actively traded. Cash surrender values are provided by third
parties and reviewed for reasonableness by the Company.

NOTE 8   RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:    

Recently Adopted Accounting Policies    

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09. This new accounting guidance
requires entities to record the differences between income tax stock expense
and book tax expense as a component of income tax expense in the income
statement. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. In the second quarter of
2016, we early adopted this new guidance. The impact on the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the three and
nine months ended October 29, 2016 was $594,000.   

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17. This new accounting guidance
requires entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities,
along with any related valuation allowance, as noncurrent in a balance sheet.
The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We have early adopted this
new guidance prospectively beginning with the Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheet at January 30, 2016, which is included in the Company s Annual Report on
Form 10-K. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.   

Recent Accounting Pronouncements    

In November
2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an effective date for a
new leasing standard that will require substantially all leases to be recorded
on the balance sheet. The standard is effective for the Company s first quarter
of its 2019 fiscal year; early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an
interim or annual reporting period. The Company is assessing what impacts this
new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.   

In July
2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards
update that will simplify the measurement of inventory for companies. The
standard differentiates the valuation methods used to measure inventory based
on the type of inventory method utilized by a company. Companies using the
first-in, first-out method and the average cost method will measure inventory
at the net realizable value method to measure inventory. Companies using the
last-in, first-out method and the retail method will use the lower of cost or
market to measure inventory. The standard is effective for the Company s first
quarter of its 2017 fiscal year; early adoption is permitted as of the
beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is assessing what
impacts this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.   

In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards
update that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance and modify
the accounting treatment for certain costs associated with revenue
generation.  The core principle of the revised revenue recognition
standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services, and provides several steps to apply to achieve that principle. 
In addition, the new guidance enhances disclosure requirements to include more
information about specific revenue contracts entered into by the entity. 
The standard is effective for the Company s first quarter of its 2018 fiscal
year;     early adoption is permitted as of the original
effective date. The Company is assessing what impacts this new standard will
have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 9   INCOME TAXES:     

The Company had a tax benefit for the third quarter of 2016
compared to an effective rate of 11.1% for the third quarter of 2015. The tax
benefit for the quarter was primarily due to a $6.0 million benefit related to
continuing foreign and domestic tax initiatives, which also includes the impact
of Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH Act) and the early adoption of
Share Based Accounting Improvements (ASU 2016-09) during the second quarter of
2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate is also due to the change in
relative proportions of net earnings attributable to various discrete items to
total pre-tax earnings between the periods.   

NOTE 10   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:     

The Company is, from time to time, involved in routine
litigation incidental to the conduct of our business, including litigation
regarding the merchandise that we sell, litigation regarding intellectual
property, litigation instituted by persons injured upon premises under our
control, litigation with respect to various employment matters, including
alleged discrimination and wage and hour litigation, and litigation with
present or former employees.   

Although such litigation is routine and incidental to the
conduct of our business, as with any business of our size with a significant
number of employees and significant merchandise sales, such litigation could
result in large monetary awards. Based on information currently available,
management does not believe that any reasonably possible losses arising from
current pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on our condensed
consolidated financial statements. However, given the inherent uncertainties involved
in such matters, an adverse outcome in one or more such matters could
materially and adversely affect the Company s financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows in any particular reporting period. We accrue for
these matters when the liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES:     

The Company s
accounting policies are more fully described in  Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016. As
disclosed in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations,  the preparation of the Company s financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future
events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with
absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the
exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those
estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements.
The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the
Company s financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts,
inventory shrinkage, the calculation of potential asset impairment, workers 
compensation, general and auto insurance liabilities, reserves related to
self-insured health insurance, and uncertain tax positions.   

The Company s
critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed with the Audit
Committee.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED):    

Comparison of the       Three     and
Nine Months ended October 29, 2016 with October 31, 2015    

Total retail sales for the third quarter
were $207.0 million compared to last year s third quarter sales of $223.3
million, a 7.3% decrease. Sales decreased primarily due to an 8.0% decrease in
same-store sales, partially offset by sales from non-comparable stores. For the
nine months ended October 29, 2016, total retail sales were $729.2 million
compared to last year s comparable nine month sales of $754.1 million. Sales in
the first nine months of fiscal 2016 decreased primarily due to a 4.0% decrease
in same-store sales, partially offset by sales from non-comparable stores. Same-store
sales include stores that have been open more than 15 months.  Stores that have
been relocated or expanded are also included in the same-store sales
calculation after they have been open more than 15 months.  The method of calculating
same-store sales varies across the retail industry.  As a result, our same-store
sales calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported
by other companies.  E-commerce sales were less than 2% of sales for the nine
months ended October 29, 2016 and are included in the same-store sales
calculation.  Total revenues, comprised of retail sales and other revenue
(principally finance charges and late fees on customer accounts receivable and
layaway fees), were $209.3 million and $736.1 million for the three and nine
months ended October 29, 2016, compared to $225.5 million and $760.6 million
for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2015, respectively. The Company
operated 1,372 stores at October 29, 2016 compared to 1,370 stores at the end
of last year s third quarter.  For the first nine months of fiscal 2016, the
Company opened three new stores, relocated four stores and closed three
stores.  In total, the Company currently expects to open approximately nine
stores, relocate six stores and close 15 stores in fiscal 2016.   

Credit revenue, a component of Other
revenue, of $1.2 million represented 0.6% of total revenues in the third
quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to 2015 credit revenue of $1.3 million or 0.6%
of total revenues.  Credit revenue decreased slightly for the most recent
comparable period due to lower finance charge income under the Company s
proprietary credit card. Credit revenue is comprised of interest earned on the
Company s private label credit card portfolio and related fee income.  Related
expenses principally include bad debt expense, payroll, postage and other
administrative expenses and totaled $0.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal
2016, compared to last year s third quarter expense of $0.8 million.    

Other revenue was $2.2 million and $6.9
million for the three and nine months ended October 29, 2016, compared to $2.2
million and $6.5 million for the prior year s comparable three and nine month
periods. The overall increase for the nine months ended October 29, 2016
resulted primarily from e-commerce shipping revenue, partially offset by lower
finance charges.   

Cost of goods sold was $133.6 million, or
64.5% of retail sales and $446.7 million or 61.3% of retail sales for the three
and nine months ended October 29, 2016, compared to $140.3 million, or 62.8% of
retail sales and $457.3 million, or 60.6% of retail sales for the comparable
three and nine month periods of fiscal 2015.  The overall increase in cost of
goods sold as a percent of retail sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2016
resulted primarily from lower sales of regular priced goods and higher sales of
markdown goods. In addition, occupancy, purchasing and sourcing costs as a percent
of retail sales increased due to lower retail sales. Cost of goods sold
includes merchandise costs (net of discounts and allowances), buying costs,
distribution costs, occupancy costs, freight and inventory shrinkage.  Net
merchandise costs and in-bound freight are capitalized as inventory costs. 
Buying and distribution costs include payroll, payroll-related costs and
operating expenses for the buying departments and distribution center. 
Occupancy costs include rent, real estate taxes, insurance, common area
maintenance, utilities and maintenance for stores and distribution facilities. 
Total gross margin dollars (retail sales less cost of goods sold exclusive of
depreciation) decreased by 11.6% to     $73.4 million for
the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and decreased by 4.8% to $282.5 million for
the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to $83.0 million and $296.8
million for the prior year s comparable three and nine months of fiscal 2015. 
Gross margin as presented may not be comparable to those of other entities.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
  OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)        

Selling, general and
administrative expenses ( SG A ) primarily include corporate and store
payroll, related payroll taxes and benefits, insurance, supplies, advertising,
bank and credit card processing fees and bad debts.  SG A expenses were
$67.8 million, or 32.8% of retail sales and $206.4 million, or 28.3% of retail
sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016, respectively,
compared to $70.7 million, or 31.6% of retail sales and $206.4 million, or 27.4%
of retail sales for the prior year s comparable three and nine month periods. 
The decrease in SG A expense for the third quarter was primarily
attributable to lower incentive-based compensation expense partially offset by
higher corporate expenses and advertising. Total SG A expenses for the
first nine months of fiscal 2016 were flat compared to the first nine months of
fiscal 2015.   

Depreciation expense
was $5.7 million, or 2.8% of retail sales and $17.1 million, or 2.3% of retail
sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016, respectively,
compared to $6.0 million, or 2.7% of retail sales and $17.0 million, or 2.3% of
retail sales for the prior year s comparable three and nine month periods of
fiscal 2015, respectively.     

Interest and other income was $1.3 million,
or 0.6% of retail sales and $5.6 million, or 0.8% of retail sales for the three
and nine months ended October 29, 2016, respectively, compared to $0.9 million,
or 0.4% of retail sales and $2.3 million, or 0.3% of retail sales for the prior
year s comparable three and nine month periods of fiscal 2015, respectively. 
The increase was primarily attributable to a change in the recognition of
unredeemed gift card breakage income, as described in Note 1.   

Income tax benefit was $4.9 million, or 2.4% of retail
sales and the income tax expense was $11.5 million, or 1.6% of retail sales for
the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of fiscal 2016, respectively,
compared to an income tax expense of $1.0 million, or 0.5% of retail sales and
$27.3 million, or 3.6% of retail sales for the prior year s comparable three
and   nine   month periods of fiscal
2015, respectively. The Company had a tax benefit for the third quarter of 2016
compared to an effective rate of 11.1% for the third quarter of 2015. The tax
benefit for the quarter was primarily due to a $6.0 million benefit related to
continuing foreign and domestic tax initiatives, which also includes the impact
of Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH Act) and the early adoption of Share
Based Accounting Improvements (ASU 2016-09) during the second quarter of 2016.
The decrease in the effective tax rate is also due to the change in relative
proportions of net earnings attributable to various discrete items to total
pre-tax earnings between the periods.   

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company experienced a
decline in same-store sales of 8.0%. This sales trend is expected to continue
into the fourth quarter. Overall the Company has experienced a number of
merchandise assortment and timing issues that have resulted in significant
reductions of regular priced sales in the third quarter. As a result, there is
a significant increase in markdown inventory at the beginning of the fourth
quarter. The Company anticipates liquidating excess inventory throughout the
fourth quarter. The Company believes that this liquidation of excess inventory
coupled with the expected large negative decline in same-store sales will put
severe pressure on fourth quarter earnings.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL
RESOURCES AND MARKET RISK:      

The Company has
consistently maintained a strong liquidity position. Cash provided by operating
activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2016 was $46.3 million as
compared to $57.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2015.  The Company
maintains a $35.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility for short-term
financing of seasonal cash needs. There were no outstanding borrowings on this
facility at October 29, 2016 and January 30, 2016.   

Cash provided by
operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 was primarily
generated by earnings adjusted for depreciation and changes in working capital.
The decrease of $11.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as
compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an
increase in merchandise inventories, partially offset by an increase in net
income.   

The Company believes
that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash
flows from operations and borrowings available under its revolving credit
agreement, will be adequate to fund the Company s regular operating
requirements, expected capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases
for fiscal 2016 and the next 12 months.   

At October 29, 2016,
the Company had working capital of $288.9 million compared to $292.6 million at
January 30, 2016.   

At October 29, 2016 and January 30, 2016,
the Company had an unsecured revolving credit agreement, which provides for
borrowings of up to $35.0 million, less the value of revocable letters of
credit discussed below.  The revolving credit agreement is committed until
August 2018. The credit agreement contains various financial covenants and
limitations, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios with which
the Company was in compliance as of October 29, 2016. There were no borrowings
outstanding under the credit facility at October 29, 2016 or January 30, 2016.
The weighted average interest rate under the credit facility was 1.4% at
October 29, 2016.   

At October 29, 2016 and January 30, 2016,
the Company had no outstanding revocable letters of credit relating to purchase
commitments.   

Expenditures for property
and equipment totaled $24.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016,
compared to $22.4 million in last fiscal year s first nine months.  The
expenditures for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 were primarily for the
development of three new stores, additional investments in new technology, an
aircraft and home office renovations.  For the full fiscal 2016 year, the
Company expects to invest approximately $27.9 million for capital expenditures
to open approximately nine new stores, relocate approximately six stores,
upgrade merchandise system, purchase corporate assets and complete home office
renovations.   

Net cash used in investing
activities totaled $18.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016
compared to $77.6 million used in the comparable period of 2015.  The decrease
was due primarily to higher sales of short-term investments and a decrease in
the purchase of other assets, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.   

Net cash used in
financing activities totaled $61.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016
compared to $30.7 million used in the comparable period of fiscal 2015. 
The increase was primarily due to repurchasing $30.4 million of shares in the
third quarter of fiscal 2016.

Company does not believe such exposure is material.   

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES       :    

We carried out an
evaluation, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and
Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of October 29, 2016.  Based on this evaluation, our Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of October
29, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e),
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), were effective
to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.    

CHANGES IN INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING:     

No change in the
Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(f)) has occurred during the Company s fiscal quarter ended October
29, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
