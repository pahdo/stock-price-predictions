  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

1.  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION: 
  The interim consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of Genesee   Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are unaudited. They do not contain all disclosures which would be required in a full set of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are presented on a basis consistent with the audited financial statements and contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to provide a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for the full year. The consolidated balance sheet data for   2015   was derived from the audited financial statements in the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. 
  The results of operations of the foreign entities are maintained in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar will impact the Company's results of operations. 
  The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period balances to conform to the current year presentation, including (1) debt issuance costs, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, less current portion (see Note   5  ,   Long-Term Debt  ) and (2) current deferred income tax assets, long-term deferred income tax assets and long-term deferred income tax liabilities (see Note   9  ,   Income Taxes  ). 
  When comparing the Company's results of operations from one reporting period to another, it is important to consider that the Company has historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to acquisitions, changing economic conditions, fluctuations in commodity prices, competitive forces, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, rail network congestion, one-time freight moves, fuel price fluctuations, customer plant expansions and shutdowns, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, high winds, droughts, heavy snowfall, unseasonably hot or cold weather, freezing and flooding, among other factors. In periods when these events occur, the Company's results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another. Finally, certain of the Company's railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, global commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, such as steel products, iron ore, paper products, lumber and forest products and agricultural products, as well as product specific market conditions, such as the availability of lower priced alternative sources of power generation (coal) and energy commodity price differentials (crude oil and natural gas liquids). Other shipments are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as winter weather (salt) and seasonal rainfall (agricultural products). As a result of these and other factors, the Company's results of operations in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to the Company's results of operations in other reporting periods.  
   
  2.  CHANGES IN OPERATIONS: 
  Australia 
  Arrium Limited:   Between 2011 and 2014, the Company's subsidiary, Genesee   Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA) invested a total of approximately   $78 million   to purchase locomotives and railcars, as well as to construct a standard gauge rolling-stock maintenance facility to support iron ore shipments from Arrium Limited's (Arrium) Southern Iron mine and its Whyalla-based operations, which include the Middleback Range iron ore mines and the Whyalla steelworks. 
  Arrium mothballed its Southern Iron mine in April 2015, citing the significant decline in the price of iron ore. During 2015, GWA carried approximately   8,300   carloads of iron ore from the Southern Iron mine and, in total, generated approximately   A$83 million   in freight and freight-related revenues (or approximately   $62 million   at the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2015) under the fixed and variable payment structure that is customary in large contracts in Australia.

  GENESEE   WYOMING INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

On April 7, 2016, Arrium announced it had entered into voluntary administration. As a result of this announcement, during the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recorded a   $13.0 million   non-cash charge related to the impairment of GWA's now idle rolling-stock maintenance facility and an allowance for doubtful accounts charge of   $8.1 million   associated with accounts receivable from Arrium. As a result of the voluntary administration, all payments to GWA associated with the Southern Iron rail haulage agreement have ceased. GWA is in the process of redeploying rolling-stock previously used to provide service under the Southern Iron rail haulage agreement to serve other customers.  
  GWA continues to receive payments and provide service under the remaining rail haulage agreement to serve several iron ore mines in the Middleback Range and the Whyalla Steelworks operations, which we expect will represent   A$35 million   (or approximately   $27 million   at the exchange rate on   September 30, 2016  ) of annual revenue prospectively. Pending the outcome of the voluntary administration process, GWA could lose some or all of the revenue associated with the remaining rail haulage agreement. In the event of an adverse determination regarding the viability of the Middleback Range or the Whyalla Steelworks operations, or a termination of the remaining rail haulage agreement, all or a portion of GWA's assets deployed to provide service under this agreement, which consist largely of narrow gauge locomotives and wagons, could be redeployed elsewhere in Australia. 
  U.K./Europe 
  Freightliner Group Limited:   On   March 25, 2015  , the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding share capital of RailInvest Holding Company Limited, the parent company of London-based   Freightliner Group Limited (Freightliner)  , pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement dated February 24, 2015. Certain former management shareholders of Freightliner (Management Shareholders) retained an approximate   6%   economic interest in Freightliner in the form of deferred consideration. The Company expects to settle the deferred consideration by the end of 2020.  
  Headquartered in London, England, Freightliner is an international freight rail operator with operations in the United Kingdom (U.K.), Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and Australia. Freightliner's principal business is located in the U.K. where it is the largest maritime intermodal operator and the second largest freight rail operator, providing service throughout England, Scotland and Wales. In Continental Europe, Freightliner Poland primarily serves aggregates and coal customers in Poland. In addition, Freightliner's ERS subsidiary, based in Rotterdam, provides cross-border intermodal services connecting the northern European ports of Rotterdam, Bremerhaven and Hamburg to key cities in Germany, Poland, Italy and beyond. In Australia, Freightliner currently transports coal and containerized agricultural products for its customers in New South Wales. As of the acquisition date, Freightliner employed approximately   2,500   people worldwide and had a fleet of primarily leased equipment, which included approximately   250   diesel locomotives,   45   electric locomotives and   5,500   railcars.  
  The Company funded the acquisition with borrowings under the Company's Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Syndicated Credit Facility Agreement, as amended (the Credit Agreement) (see Note   5  ,   Long-Term Debt  ) and available cash. The foreign exchange rate used to translate the total consideration to United States dollars was   $1.49   for one British pound (GBP). The calculation of the total consideration for the Freightliner acquisition is presented below (amounts in thousands): 

As of March 25, 2015, the Company recorded a contingent liability within other long-term liabilities of    24.2 million   (or   $36.0 million   at the exchange rate on March 25, 2015). This contingent liability represented the aggregate fair value of the shares transferred to the Company by the Management Shareholders representing an economic interest of approximately   6%   on the acquisition date at the Freightliner acquisition price per share, in exchange for the right to receive cash consideration for the representative economic interest in the future (deferred consideration). The Company will recalculate the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration in each reporting period until it is paid in full by using a contractual formula designed to estimate the economic value of the Management Shareholders' retained interest in a manner consistent with that used to derive the Freightliner acquisition price per share on the acquisition date. Accordingly, a change in the fair value of the deferred consideration could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations for the period in which a change in estimate occurs. The fair value of the contingent liability has not materially changed since the March 25, 2015 acquisition date (see Note   7  ,   Fair Value of Financial Instruments  ).

  GENESEE   WYOMING INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

The results of operations from Freightliner have been included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations since the March 25, 2015 acquisition date. U.K. and Continental Europe operations are included in the Company's U.K./European Operations segment and the results of Freightliner's Australia operations are included in the Company's Australian Operations segment (see Note   13  ,   Segment Information  ). Freightliner contributed   $363.5 million   of total revenues and   $21.4 million   of operating income to the Company's consolidated results during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The Company incurred   $0.7 million   and   $14.0 million   of acquisition and integration costs associated with Freightliner during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, which were included within other expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the Company recorded a loss of   $18.7 million   on the settlement of foreign currency forward purchase contracts during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which were entered into in contemplation of the Freightliner acquisition (see Note   6  ,   Derivative Financial Instruments  ).  
  Pro Forma Financial Results (Unaudited) 
  The following table summarizes the Company's unaudited pro forma operating results for the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2015   as if the acquisition of Freightliner had been consummated as of January 1, 2014. The following pro forma financial information does not include the impact of any costs to integrate the operations or the impact of derivative instruments that the Company has entered into or may enter into to mitigate interest rate risk (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 

The unaudited pro forma operating results included the acquisition of Freightliner adjusted, net of tax, for depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the determination of fair values of the acquired property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, the inclusion of interest expense related to borrowings used to fund the acquisition, the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the Company's entry into the Credit Agreement and the elimination of Freightliner's interest expense related to debt not assumed in the acquisition. Since the pro forma financial results assume the acquisition was consummated on January 1, 2014, the 2015 unaudited pro forma operating results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   excluded   $12.6 million   (  $9.5 million  , net of tax) of costs incurred by the Company related to the acquisition of Freightliner,   $12.2 million   (  $9.1 million  , net of tax) of transaction-related costs incurred by Freightliner and an   $18.7 million   (  $11.6 million  , net of tax) loss on settlement of foreign currency forward purchase contracts directly attributable to the acquisition of Freightliner.  
  Prior to the acquisition, Freightliner's fiscal year was based on a 52/53 week period ending on the nearest Saturday on or before March 31. Since Freightliner and the Company had different fiscal year end dates, the unaudited pro forma operating results were prepared based on comparable periods. The unaudited pro forma operating results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were based upon the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and the sum of Freightliner's historical operating results for the 12 weeks ended March 28, 2015, adjusted for the five days already included in the Company's first quarter results. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Freightliner's historical operating results to United States dollars was   $1.51   for one British pound (which was calculated based on average daily exchange rates during the three month period ended March 31, 2015).  
  The pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of the results that actually would have been obtained had the transactions been completed as of January 1, 2014 and for the periods presented and are not intended to be a projection of future results or trends. 
  North America 
  Pinsly's Arkansas Division:   On   January 5, 2015  , the Company completed the acquisition of certain subsidiaries of Pinsly Railroad Company (Pinsly) that constituted Pinsly's Arkansas Division (Pinsly Arkansas) for   $41.3 million   in cash. The Company funded the acquisition with borrowings under the Company's Amended and Restated Senior Secured Syndicated Credit Facility Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement). The results of operations from Pinsly Arkansas have been included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition date within the Company's North American Operations segment.

  The Company periodically receives grants for the upgrade and construction of rail lines and the upgrade of locomotives from federal, provincial, state and local agencies in the United States and provinces in Canada in which the Company operates. These grants typically reimburse the Company for 50% to 100% of the actual cost of specific projects. In total, the Company received grant proceeds of   $30.0 million   and   $31.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, from such grant programs. The proceeds were presented as cash inflows from investing activities within each of the applicable periods. 
  None of the Company's grants represent a future liability of the Company unless the Company abandons the rehabilitated or new track structure within a specified period of time or fails to maintain the upgraded or new track to certain standards, fails to make certain minimum capital improvements or ceases use of the locomotives within the specified geographic area and time period, or fails to comply with other grant provisions in each case, as set forth in the applicable grant agreement. As the Company intends to comply with the requirements of these agreements, the Company has recorded additions to track property and locomotives and has deferred the amount of the grants. The amortization of deferred grants is a non-cash offset to depreciation expense over the useful lives of the related assets.  
  The following table sets forth the offset to depreciation expense from the amortization of deferred grants recorded by the Company during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands): 

Insurance and Third-Party Claims 
  Accounts receivable from insurance and other third-party claims at   September 30, 2016   included   $6.9 million   from the Company's North American Operations,   $5.1 million   from the Company's Australian Operations and   $6.0 million   from the Company's U.K./European Operations. The balance from the Company's North American Operations resulted predominately from the Company's anticipated insurance recoveries associated with a trestle fire in 2015 and a derailment in 2014 due to a washout. The balance from the Company's Australian Operations resulted primarily from the Company's anticipated insurance recoveries associated with derailments in Australia in 2012 and 2015. The balance from the Company's U.K./European Operations resulted primarily from the Company's anticipated insurance recoveries associated with a rail-related collision in Germany in 2014 that occurred prior to the Company's acquisition of Freightliner. The Company received proceeds from insurance totaling   $10.3 million   and   $9.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   
  5.  LONG-TERM DEBT: 
  Credit Agreement 
  In anticipation of its acquisition of Freightliner, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement on March 20, 2015. The credit facilities under the Credit Agreement are comprised of a   $1,782.0 million   United States term loan, an   A$324.6 million   (or   $252.5 million   at the exchange rate on March 20, 2015) Australian term loan, a    101.7 million   (or   $152.2 million   at the exchange rate on March 20, 2015) U.K. term loan and a   $625.0 million   revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit and swingline loans. In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, the Company wrote-off   $2.0 million   of unamortized deferred financing fees and deferred   $5.8 million   of new fees. The maturity date of each of the Company's credit facilities under the Credit Agreement is   March 31, 2020  .  
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03,   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires debt issuance costs to be recorded as a direct reduction of the debt liability on the balance sheet rather than as an asset. The Company applied this guidance to all of its outstanding debt issuance costs retrospectively to all periods presented. The December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet and related disclosures were adjusted to reflect the reclassification of   $23.5 million   of debt issuance costs from other assets to a reduction in current portion of long-term debt of   $6.0 million   and a reduction in long-term debt, less current portion, of   $17.5 million  . There was no other impact on the consolidated financial statements from the adoption of this guidance.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
   
  6.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: 
  The Company actively monitors its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and uses derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of these risks. The Company uses derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures. The Company does not trade or use derivative instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations alone, nor does the Company use derivative instruments where it does not have underlying exposures. Complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used. The Company manages its hedging position and monitors the credit ratings of counterparties and does not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance. Management believes its use of derivative instruments to manage risk is in the Company's best interest. However, the Company's use of derivative financial instruments may result in short-term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility. The Company's instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in prepaid expenses and other, other assets, net, accrued expenses or other long-term liabilities. 
  The Company may designate derivatives as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or a hedge of the variability of the cash flows to be received or paid in the future related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). The portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative used as a cash flow hedge that is offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (the effective portion) is recorded in other comprehensive income/(loss). As the hedged item is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) is reported in the consolidated statements of operations on the same line item as the hedged item. The portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges that is not offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (the ineffective portion) is immediately recognized in earnings on the same line item as the hedged item. 
  The Company matches the hedge instrument to the underlying hedged item (assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions). At inception of the hedge and at least quarterly thereafter, the Company assesses whether the derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. When it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting, and any gains or losses on the derivative instrument thereafter are recognized in earnings during the period in which it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
  From time to time, the Company may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for accounting purposes. For example, to mitigate currency exposures related to intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt. The Company believes such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk. The gains or losses from the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not accounted for using hedge accounting are recognized in current period earnings within other income/(loss), net. Derivative instruments entered into in conjunction with contemplated acquisitions also do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. 
  Interest Rate Risk Management 
  The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to the changes in interest rates on the Company's variable rate debt. These swap agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of the swap agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income/(loss), based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the future interest payments attributable to the underlying portion of the Company's variable rate debt. Interest payments accrued each reporting period for these interest rate swaps are recognized in interest expense. The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships,   which clarifies that a change in counterparty to a derivative contract in and of itself, does not require the dedesignation of a hedging relationship. ASU 2016-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted and entities have the option of adopting this guidance on a prospective basis to new derivative contracts or on a modified retrospective basis. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-05 on July 1, 2016, on a prospective basis and there was no impact to the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  The following table summarizes the terms of the Company's outstanding interest rate swap agreements entered into to manage the Company's exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt (dollars in thousands): 

On November 9, 2012, the Company entered into multiple 10-year forward starting interest rate swap agreements to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates on the Company's variable rate debt. On   September 30, 2016  , the Company amended its forward starting swaps which included moving the mandatory settlement date from   September 30, 2016   to   September 30, 2020  , changing from 3-month LIBOR to 1-month LIBOR and adjusting the fixed rate. The amended forward starting swaps continue to qualify for hedge accounting. In addition, it remains probable that the Company will either issue   $300.0 million   of fixed-rate debt or have   $300.0 million   of variable-rate debt under the Company's commercial banking lines throughout the term of the outstanding swap agreements. The Company expects to amortize any gains or losses on the settlements over the life of the respective swap. 
  The following table summarizes the Company's interest rate swap agreements that expired during 2016 (dollars in thousands):   

  The fair values of the Company's interest rate swap agreements were estimated based on Level 2 inputs. The Company's effectiveness testing during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   resulted in   no   amount of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings due to ineffectiveness. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $0.4 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively, of existing net losses were realized and recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ,   $0.9 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively, of existing net losses were realized and recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Based on the Company's fair value assumptions as of   September 30, 2016  , it expects to realize   $4.1 million   of existing net losses that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings within the next 12 months. See Note   11  ,   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss  , for additional information regarding the Company's cash flow hedges. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's foreign subsidiaries had   $487.3 million   of third-party debt, including capital leases, denominated in the local currencies in which the Company's foreign subsidiaries operate, including the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Euro. The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those foreign operations. As a result, foreign currency risk related to this portion of the Company's debt service payments is limited. However, in the event the foreign currency debt service is not paid by the Company's foreign subsidiaries and is paid by its United States subsidiaries, the Company may face exchange rate risk if the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar or the Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.

The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to its foreign subsidiaries, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically associated with intercompany debt from the Company's United States subsidiaries to its foreign subsidiaries, associated with acquisitions and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business. To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar-denominated acquisitions, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward purchase contracts. To mitigate currency exposures related to non-functional currency denominated intercompany debt, cross-currency swaps or foreign currency forward contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt. In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets. However, cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate exposures on foreign currency intercompany debt may not qualify for hedge accounting. In cases where the cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Company believes that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk. The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in current period earnings within other income/(loss), net. 
  On   February 25, 2015  , the Company announced its entry into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding share capital of RailInvest Holding Company Limited, the parent company of Freightliner, for cash consideration of approximately    490 million   (or approximately   $755 million   at the exchange rate on   February 25, 2015  ). Shortly after the announcement of the acquisition, the Company entered into British pound forward purchase contracts to fix    307.1 million   of the purchase price to US  $475.0 million   and    84.7 million   of the purchase price to   A$163.8 million  . The subsequent decrease in value of the British pound versus the United States and Australian dollars between the dates the British pound forward purchase contracts were entered into and March 23, 2015, the date that the    391.8 million   in funds were delivered, resulted in a loss on settlement of foreign currency forward purchase contracts of   $18.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  On March 25, 2015, the Company closed on the Freightliner transaction and paid cash consideration for the acquisition of    492.1 million   (or   $733.0 million   at the exchange rate on March 25, 2015). The Company financed the acquisition through a combination of available cash and borrowings under the Company's Credit Agreement. A portion of the funds were transferred from the United States to the U.K. through an intercompany loan with a notional amount of    120.0 million   (or   $181.0 million   at the exchange rate on the effective date of the loan) and accrued interest as of   September 30, 2016   of    11.5 million   (or   $14.9 million   at the exchange rate on   September 30, 2016  ), each of which are expected to remain until maturity of the loan. To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to this non-functional currency intercompany loan and the related interest, the Company entered into British pound forward contracts, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges.  
  The fair values of the Company's British pound forward contracts were estimated based on Level 2 inputs. The Company's effectiveness testing during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   resulted in   no   amount of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings due to ineffectiveness. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $3.9 million   (  $2.3 million  , net of tax) and   $22.8 million   (  $13.7 million  , net of tax), respectively, of net gains were recorded as other income in the consolidated statements of operations fully offsetting the corresponding foreign currency losses on the intercompany loan and accrued interest. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $0.3 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively, of net gains were recorded as interest income in the consolidated statements of operations. Based on the Company's fair value assumptions as of   September 30, 2016  , it expects to realize   $0.6 million   of existing net gains that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings within the next 12 months. See Note   11  ,   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss  , for additional information regarding the Company's cash flow hedges.

7.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: 
  The Company applies the following three-level hierarchy of valuation inputs for measuring fair value: 
             
    Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 
                
    Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data. 
                
    Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable. 
     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments held by the Company: 
  Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value:   Derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. During the reporting period, the Company's derivative financial instruments consisted of interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward contracts. The Company estimated the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including fixed interest rates, LIBOR implied forward interest rates and the remaining time to maturity. The Company estimated the fair value of its British pound forward contracts based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including LIBOR implied forward interest rates, British pound LIBOR implied forward interest rates and the remaining time to maturity. 
  The Company's recurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) relate solely to the Company's deferred consideration from the Freightliner acquisition. The fair value of the deferred consideration liability was estimated by discounting, to present value, contingent payments expected to be made. 
  Financial Instruments Carried at Historical Cost:   Since the Company's long-term debt is not actively traded, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including borrowing rates the Company believes are currently available to it for loans with similar terms and maturities. 
  The following table presents the Company's financial instruments carried at fair value using Level 2 inputs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

The following table presents the Company's financial instrument carried at fair value using Level 3 inputs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (amounts in thousands):

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

The Company's recurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) relate solely to the Company's deferred consideration from the Freightliner acquisition. At the date of acquisition, this contingent liability represented the aggregate fair value of the shares transferred to the Company by the Management Shareholders in exchange for the right to receive cash consideration for the representative economic interest of approximately   6%   in Freightliner in the future (deferred consideration). Each of the Management Shareholders may elect to receive one third of their respective deferred consideration valued as of March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The remaining portion of the deferred consideration will be valued as of March 31, 2020 and paid by the end of 2020. 
  The contingent liability is adjusted each period to represent the fair value of the deferred consideration as of the balance sheet date. To do so, the Company recalculates the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration in each reporting period until it is paid in full by using a contractual formula designed to estimate the economic value of the Management Shareholders' retained interest in a manner consistent with that used to derive the Freightliner acquisition price per share on the acquisition date. This calculation effectively represents the present value of the expected payment to be made upon settlement of the deferred consideration. Accordingly, such recalculations will reflect both the impact of the time value of money and the impact of changes in the expected future performance of the acquired business, as applicable. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   $0.9 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively, through other expenses within the Company's consolidated statements of operations as a result of the change in the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration, which primarily represented the time value of money. The Company expects to recognize future changes in the contingent liability for the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration through other expenses within the Company's consolidated statement of operations. These future changes in the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration are not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
  The following table presents the carrying value and fair value using Level 2 inputs of the Company's financial instruments carried at historical cost as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

8.  U.K. PENSION PLAN: 
  In connection with the acquisition of Freightliner, the Company assumed a defined benefit pension plan for its U.K. employees through a standalone shared cost arrangement within the Railways Pension Scheme (Pension Program). The Pension Program is managed and administered by a professional pension administration company and is overseen by trustees with professional advice from independent actuaries and other advisers. The Pension Program is a shared cost arrangement with required contributions shared between Freightliner and its employees, with Freightliner contributing   60%   and the remaining   40%   contributed by active employees. The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to the Pension Program subject to the assumptions that the Company selects.  
  The following tables summarize the components of the Pension Program related to the net benefit costs recognized in labor and benefits in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands):

  GENESEE   WYOMING INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company contributed    5.0 million   (or   $6.5 million   at the   September 30, 2016   exchange rate) to fund the Pension Program. The Company expects to contribute    1.7 million   (or   $2.2 million   at the   September 30, 2016   exchange rate) to the Pension Program for the remainder of 2016. The Pension Program's assets may undergo significant changes over time as a result of market conditions. In the event that the Pension Program's projected assets and liabilities reveal additional funding requirements, the shared cost arrangement generally means that the Company will be required to pay   60%   of any additional contributions, with active members contributing the remaining   40%  , in each case over an agreed recovery period. If the Pension Program was to be terminated and wound up, any deficit would fall entirely on the Company and could not be shared with active members. Currently, the Company has no intention of terminating the Pension Program. 
   
  9.  INCOME TAXES: 
  The Company's effective income tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   25.7%  , compared with   36.8%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The Company's effective income tax rate for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   29.2%   compared with   37.2%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The Company's provision for income taxes for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included an income tax benefit of   $7.8 million   and   $21.4 million  , respectively, associated with the United States Short Line Tax Credit.   In December   2015  , the United States Short Line Tax Credit (which had previously expired on December 31, 2014), was extended for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. As the extension was passed in December 2015 for the full 2015 fiscal year, the United States Short Line Tax Credit associated with results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  The United States Short Line Tax Credit is an income tax track maintenance credit for Class II and Class III railroads to reduce their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures. Qualified expenditures include amounts incurred for maintaining track, including roadbed, bridges and related track structures owned or leased by a Class II or Class III railroad. The credit is equal to   50%   of the qualified expenditures, subject to an annual limitation of   $3,500   multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the Class II or Class III railroad as of the end of its tax year. 
  The Company's provision for income taxes for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   also included a   $4.3 million   income tax benefit as a result of the Company remeasuring its deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the U.K. based on the newly enacted change to the corporate income tax rate by the U.K. government that will apply when the temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. The Company's provision for income taxes for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   also included a valuation allowance of   A$2.6 million   (or   $2.0 million   at the average exchange rate in March of 2016) associated with the impairment of GWA's now idle rolling-stock maintenance facility (see Note   2  ,   Changes in Operations  ) that was formerly used in connection with the Southern Iron rail haulage agreement. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,   which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. For public entities, the amendments in this guidance are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company early adopted the provisions of this ASU as of January 1, 2016 and applied it retrospectively to all periods presented. The December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet was adjusted to reflect a reduction of current deferred income tax assets of   $69.2 million  , an increase in non-current deferred income tax assets of   $0.2 million   and a reduction in non-current deferred income tax liabilities of   $69.0 million  . There was no other impact on the consolidated financial statements from the adoption of this guidance.

10.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: 
  From time to time, the Company is a defendant in certain lawsuits resulting from the Company's operations in the ordinary course as the nature of the Company's business exposes it to the potential for various claims and litigation, including those related to property damage, personal injury, freight loss, labor and employment, environmental and other matters. The Company maintains insurance policies to mitigate the financial risk associated with such claims.  
  Any material changes to pending litigation or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage, personal injury and environmental liability or other claims against the Company that are not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
  Management believes there are adequate provisions in the financial statements for any probable liabilities that may result from disposition of the pending lawsuits. Based upon currently available information, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to the Company's results of operations or have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or liquidity. 
   
  11.  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS: 
  The following tables set forth the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss included in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of comprehensive income/(loss) (dollars in thousands): 

(a) Existing net gains realized were recorded in labor and benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. 
  (b) Existing net losses realized were recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations (see Note   6  ,   Derivative Financial Instruments  ). 
   
  12.  SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES: 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company had outstanding receivables from outside parties for the funding of capital expenditures of   $10.8 million   and   $25.0 million  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company also had   $14.9 million   and   $24.6 million  , respectively, of purchases of property and equipment that were not paid and, accordingly, were accrued in accounts payable in the normal course of business.

13.  SEGMENT INFORMATION: 
  The Company presents the financial results of its   10   operating regions as   three   reportable segments: North American Operations, Australian Operations and U.K./European Operations. Each of the Company's segments generates the following three categories of revenues from external customers: freight revenues, freight-related revenues and all other revenues. The Company's   eight   North American regions are aggregated into one segment as a result of having similar economic and operating characteristics. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company's Ohio Valley Region railroads were consolidated into the Company's Northeast and Midwest regions. This consolidation reduced the Company's number of operating regions from 11 to 10.  
  During 2016, the Company incurred restructuring costs of   $6.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , including   $4.7 million   in our U.K./European Operations,   $0.8 million   in our Australian Operations and   $0.8 million   in our North American Operations. 
  The results of operations of the foreign entities are maintained in the respective local currency (the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar will impact the Company's results of operations. 
  The following table reflects the average exchange rates used to translate the foreign entities respective local currency results of operations into United States dollars for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The following tables set forth selected financial data for the Company's reportable segments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands):

14.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS: 
  Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),   which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and includes the specific steps for recognizing revenue and disclosure requirements. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, which provides clarification when identifying performance obligations and providing implementation guidance on licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, which clarifies the objective of the collectability criterion. The new standards will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which will require lessees to recognize leases on their balance sheets as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding liability. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize an asset and liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting under the provisions of the standard is substantially unchanged. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will also be required. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, requiring a modified retrospective transition approach and include a number of practical expedients. Early application is permitted. The standard will become effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based compensation arrangements, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of related amounts within the statement of cash flows. The amendments will be effective for the Company January 1, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,   which provides guidance on eight targeted changes with respect to how cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statements of cash flows. The amendments will be effective for the Company January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
  15.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS: 
  Acquisition of Providence and Worcester Railroad Company 
  On   November 1, 2016  , the Company completed the acquisition of Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (P W) for   $25.00   per share, or   $126.2 million  . Immediately following the closing of the acquisition, control of the P W shares was placed into a voting trust, which will remain in effect until the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) issues its decision on the Company's pending application to control P W. Upon receipt of STB approval, P W would be managed as part of the Company's Northeast Region. The acquisition was funded with borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

Headquartered in Worcester, Massachusetts, P W is contiguous with G W s New England Central Railroad (NECR) and Connecticut Southern Railroad (CSO). Rail service is provided by approximately   140   P W employees with   32   locomotives across   163   miles of owned track and over approximately   350   miles under track access agreements, including exclusive freight access over Amtrak s Northeast Corridor between New Haven, Connecticut, and Providence, Rhode Island, and trackage rights over Metro-North Commuter Railroad, Amtrak and CSX Corp. between New Haven, Connecticut, and Queens, New York. P W interchanges with G W s NECR and CSO railroads, as well as with CSX, Norfolk Southern, Pan Am Railways, Pan Am Southern, the Housatonic Railroad and the New York and Atlantic Railroad, and also connects to Canadian National and Canadian Pacific via NECR.  
  P W serves a diverse mix of aggregates, auto, chemicals, metals and lumber customers in southeastern New England, handling approximately   43,000   carloads and intermodal units annually. In addition, P W provides rail service to   three   ports (Providence and Davisville, Rhode Island and New Haven, Connecticut) and to a United States Customs bonded intermodal terminal in Worcester, Massachusetts, that receives inbound intermodal containers for distribution in New England. P W also owns approximately   45   acres of undeveloped waterfront land in East Providence, Rhode Island, that was initially created as deep water, rail served port through a   $12 million   investment. The Company expects to sell this undeveloped land. 
  In connection with the acquisition of the P W, in September 2016, four shareholder class action lawsuits were commenced in the Rhode Island Superior Court for Providence County against the Company, P W and P W s directors. Among other matters, the purported class actions challenge the sale of P W to the Company, and allege that the P W's board of directors breached its fiduciary duties to the P W's shareholders by failing to maximize shareholder value in approving the merger agreement associated with the acquisition. The lawsuits also assert that P W and the Company aided and abetted the alleged breach of fiduciary duty. The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to the Company's results of operations or have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or liquidity. The Company, along with the other defendants, vigorously denies all of the allegations in the purported class actions. 
  Agreement to Acquire Glencore Rail and Partner with Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets 
    On   October 20, 2016  , the Company announced that its subsidiary, Genesee   Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA), has entered into agreements to acquire Glencore Rail Pty Limited (GRail) for   A$1.14 billion   (or approximately   $866 million   at an exchange rate of   $0.76   for one Australian dollar) and concurrently issue a   49%   equity stake in GWA to funds managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) (the GRail Transactions). The GRail Transactions are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to Australian Foreign Investment Review Board approval. The sources and uses to accomplish the GRail Transactions are expected to be as follows (A$ in millions): 

In connection with the GRail Transactions, the Company entered into a debt commitment letter for debt financing, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the lenders have committed to provide the Company up to   A$690 million   (or approximately   $524 million   at an exchange rate of   $0.76   for one Australian dollar) in non-recourse five-year senior secured term loan facilities and up to   A$50 million   (or approximately   $38 million   at an exchange rate of   $0.76   for one Australian dollar) in the form of a revolving loan facility. 
  On October 20, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Amendment Agreement) to the Credit Agreement. The Amendment Agreement permits, among other things, the Company to enter into the GRail Transactions and also permits the repayment in full and termination of all obligations of GWA under the Credit Agreement.

GRail s coal haulage business was established in 2010 as an alternative rail service provider to the incumbent railroads in the Hunter Valley and has grown to be the third largest coal haulage business in Australia. G W s Freightliner Australia subsidiary (acquired by the Company in March 2015) has been the rail operator of GRail since inception and presently provides haulage and logistics services for approximately   40 million   tonnes per year of steam coal that is among the lowest cost and highest quality coal in the world sold principally to customers in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. These services will continue following the GRail Transactions. The Company will continue to consolidate   100%   of GWA in its financial statements upon completion of the GRail Transactions, and will record a noncontrolling interest for MIRA's   49%   equity ownership.  
  In conjunction with the acquisition of GRail, GWA will enter into a new 20-year rail haulage contract with Glencore Coal Pty Limited (GC). The rail haulage contract will contain rights, subject to certain limitations, to exclusively haul all coal produced at GC s existing mines in the Hunter Valley to the Port of Newcastle and will have minimum guaranteed volumes over the first 18 years. Initial volumes under the rail haulage contract are expected to be approximately   40 million   tonnes per year. GC s obligations under the contract will be guaranteed by Glencore plc (LON:GLEN). GRail currently has   nine   train sets (  30   locomotives and   894   wagons). Rail haulage service is operated on government-owned, open-access track that is coordinated by a neutral third party.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. When comparing our results of operations from one reporting period to another, it is important to consider that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to acquisitions, changing economic conditions, commodity prices, competitive forces, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, rail network congestion, one-time freight moves, fuel price fluctuations, customer plant expansions and shutdowns, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, high winds, droughts, heavy snowfall, unseasonably hot or cold weather, freezing and flooding, among other factors. In periods when these events occur, our results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another. Finally, certain of our railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, global commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, such as steel products, iron ore, paper products, lumber and forest products and agricultural products, as well as product specific market conditions, such as the availability of lower priced alternative sources of power generation (coal) and energy commodity price differentials (crude oil and natural gas liquids). Other shipments are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as winter weather (salt) and seasonal rainfall (agricultural products). As a result of these and other factors, our results of operations in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to our results of operations in other reporting periods. When we discuss foreign exchange impact, we are referring to the change in our results due to the change in foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate foreign exchange impact by comparing the prior period results translated from local currency to United States dollars using current period exchange rates to the prior period results in United States dollars as reported. Constant currency, which is a non-GAAP measure, reflects the prior period results translated at the current period exchange rates. When we discuss results from existing operations or same railroad operations, we are referring to the change in our results, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (  i.e.  , excluding the impact of acquisitions). 
   
  Overview 
  We own or lease   121   freight railroads worldwide that are organized in   10   operating regions with approximately   7,200   employees and more than   2,800   customers. During the second quarter of 2016, our Ohio Valley Region railroads were consolidated into our Northeast and Midwest regions. This consolidation reduced the number of our operating regions from 11 to 10.  
  The financial results of our   10   operating regions are reported in the following   three   reportable segments: 
             
    Our North American Operations segment includes eight operating regions that serve   41   U.S. states and   four   Canadian provinces. This segment includes   113   short line and regional freight railroads with more than   13,000   track-miles.  
                
    Our Australian Operations segment provides rail freight services in South Australia, the Northern Territory and New South Wales. Included in the Australian Operations segment is our operation of the   1,400  -mile Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line, which is the sole inland north-south rail corridor and primarily carries intermodal and commodity freight. 
                
    Our U.K./European Operations segment includes the majority of the operations of Freightliner Group Limited (Freightliner), which we acquired in March 2015. Freightliner is the United Kingdom's (U.K.) largest rail maritime intermodal operator and the U.K.'s second-largest rail freight company. Our U.K./European Operations segment also includes heavy-haul freight operations in Poland and Germany and cross-border intermodal services connecting Northern European seaports with key industrial regions throughout the continent.  
     Recent Developments 
  Providence and Worcester Railroad Company:   On   November 1, 2016  , we completed the acquisition of Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (P W) for   $25.00   per share, or   $126.2 million  . Immediately following the closing of the acquisition, control of the P W shares was placed into a voting trust, which will remain in effect until the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) issues its decision on our pending application to control P W. Upon receipt of STB approval, P W would be managed as part of our Northeast Region. The acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. For additional information regarding the P W acquisition, see Note   15  ,   Subsequent Events  , to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Glencore Rail Pty Limited:   On   October 20, 2016  , we announced that our subsidiary, Genesee   Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA), has entered into agreements to acquire Glencore Rail Pty Limited (GRail) for   A$1.14 billion   (or approximately   $866 million   at an exchange rate of   $0.76 for one Australian dollar  ) and concurrently issue a   49%   equity stake in GWA to funds managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) (the GRail Transactions). The GRail Transactions are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to Australian Foreign Investment Review Board approval. To create an   A$2 billion   enterprise value partnership, we and MIRA are contributing a combined   A$1.3 billion   in the form of cash, shareholder loans and contributed equity, and GWA is entering into a new five-year   A$690 million   senior secured term loan facility that is non-recourse to us and MIRA. The contributions and the proceeds from the borrowings under GWA's new senior secured term loan facility will be used, among other things, to acquire GRail for   A$1.14 billion  , repay GWA's existing   A$250 million   term loan (under our Credit Agreement) and pay   A$32 million   of transaction costs. For additional information regarding the GRail Transactions, see Note   15  ,   Subsequent Events  , to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Overview of Three-Month Results 
  Our operating revenues   decreased     $45.3 million  , or   8.3%  , to   $501.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $546.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Operating income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $91.9 million  , compared with   $117.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our operating ratio, defined as operating expenses divided by operating revenues, was   81.7%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   78.5%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Net income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $56.8 million  , compared with net income of   $63.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $0.98   with   58.2 million   weighted average shares outstanding, compared with diluted EPS of   $1.10   with   57.8 million   weighted average shares outstanding for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Our results for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   included certain items affecting comparability between the periods that are set forth below (dollars in millions, except per share amounts): 

For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our results included corporate development and related costs of   $4.3 million  , primarily associated with the GRail and P W transactions, restructuring costs of   $0.2 million   and a net gain on the sale of assets of   $0.5 million  . The   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   also included an income tax benefit of   $7.8 million   associated with the United States Short Line Tax Credit, which was not in effect for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , as well as an income tax benefit of   $4.3 million   associated with a reduction in the U.K. income tax rate, which was enacted in September   2016  . The Short Line Tax Credit was extended retroactively in the fourth quarter of   2015   for fiscal years   2015   and   2016  . 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , our results included corporate development and related costs of   $2.0 million  , primarily related to the integration of Freightliner, and a net gain on the sale of assets of   $1.2 million  . 
  Operating revenues from our North American Operations   decreased     $4.4 million  , or   1.4%  , to   $310.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $314.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in North America's operating revenues was primarily due to lower fuel surcharges and a decline in coal shipments.

     Table of Contents  

North American Operations traffic   decreased     17,572   carloads, or   4.2%  , to   401,999   carloads for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   The traffic   decrease   was principally due to decreases of 8,169 carloads of coal and coke traffic (primarily in the Central, Northeast and Midwest regions), 3,549 carloads of pulp and paper traffic (primarily in the Southern, Canada and Northeast regions), 3,447 carloads of minerals and stone traffic (primarily in the Northeast region), 2,529 carloads of metals traffic (primarily in the Southern, Coastal and Canada regions) and 2,257 carloads of other traffic (primarily in the Southern and Canada regions), partially offset by an increase of 3,014 carloads of agricultural products traffic (primarily in the Central and Pacific regions). All remaining traffic decreased by a net 635 carloads. 
  Operating income from our North American Operations for   the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $87.2 million  , compared with   $90.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The operating ratio from our North American Operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   71.9%  , compared with   71.2%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Operating income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   included   $1.0 million   of corporate development and related costs, primarily associated with the P W and GRail transactions. Operating income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   included   $1.2 million   of corporate development and related costs, primarily associated with the integration of Freightliner.  
  Operating revenues from our Australian Operations   decreased     $6.9 million  , or   11.2%  , to   $54.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $61.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Excluding a   $2.7 million     increase   from the impact of foreign currency appreciation, our Australian Operations operating revenues   decreased     $9.6 million  , or   15.0%  , primarily due to the loss of a fixed fee payment associated with a now closed iron ore mine that we previously served and lower metallic ores shipments. 
  Australian Operations traffic   decreased     5,000   carloads, or   10.3%  , to   43,532   carloads for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   The traffic   decrease   was principally due to decreases   of 2,818 carloads of agricultural products traffic, 878 carloads of metallic ores traffic, 657 carloads of minerals and stone traffic and 628 carloads of intermodal traffic.  
  Operating income from our Australian Operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $4.4 million  , compared with   $15.0 million     for   the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Operating income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   included   $2.9 million   of corporate development and related costs, primarily associated with the GRail Transactions. 
  Operating revenues from our U.K./European Operations   decreased     $34.1 million  , or   20.0%  , to   $136.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $170.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Excluding an   $18.1 million     decrease   due to the impact of foreign currency depreciation, U.K./European revenues   decreased     $16.0 million  , or   10.5%  , primarily due to lower intermodal services and coal shipments. 
  U.K./European Operations traffic   decreased     10,264   carloads, or   3.4%  , to   294,283   carloads for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The traffic   decrease   was principally due to decreases of 8,402 carloads of coal and coke traffic (primarily in the U.K. and Poland) and 4,106 carloads of intermodal traffic (primarily in the U.K.), partially offset by an increase of 1,761 carloads of minerals and stone traffic.  
  Operating income from our U.K./European Operations for   the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.3 million  , compared with operating income of   $12.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in operating income from our U.K./European Operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to lower U.K. intermodal and infrastructure services of approximately $4 million resulting from port congestion and timing of rail projects and a loss of approximately $3 million from Continental Europe intermodal due to business restructuring, exiting traffic lanes and surplus equipment. In addition, our U.K. coal business had residual surplus equipment costs of approximately $2 million and our overall U.K./European Operations had a negative impact from the depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar of approximately $2 million.  
  Overview of Nine-Month Results 
  Our operating revenues   decreased     $0.6 million  , to   $1,485.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $1,485.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Operating income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $236.0 million  , compared with   $289.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $53.6 million  , or   18.5%  . Our operating ratio was   84.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   80.5%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our same railroad operating ratio for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   82.7%  , compared with   80.5%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . When we discuss either operating ratios from existing operations or same railroad operating ratios, we are referring to the change in our operating ratio, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (  i.e.  , excluding the impact of acquisitions, such as Freightliner for the period January 1, 2016 through March 24, 2016).

Net income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $132.2 million  , compared with net income of   $140.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our diluted EPS for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $2.28   with   58.1 million   weighted average shares outstanding, compared with diluted EPS of   $2.42   with   57.8 million   weighted average shares outstanding for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included an income tax benefit of   $21.4 million   associated with the United States Short Line Tax Credit, which was not in effect for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Our results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   included certain items affecting comparability between the periods that are set forth below (dollars in millions, except per share amounts): 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated   $303.6 million   in cash flows from operating activities. During the same period, we purchased   $159.5 million   of property and equipment, including   $9.3 million   for new business investments, partially offset by   $30.0 million   in cash received from government grants and other outside parties for capital spending. We also paid   $200.6 million   in net payments on our outstanding debt obligations. 
   
  Changes in Operations 
  Australia 
  Arrium Limited:   Between 2011 and 2014, our subsidiary, Genesee   Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA) invested a total of approximately   $78 million   to purchase locomotives and railcars, as well as to construct a standard gauge rolling-stock maintenance facility to support iron ore shipments from Arrium Limited's (Arrium) Southern Iron mine and its Whyalla-based operations, which include the Middleback Range iron ore mines and the Whyalla steelworks. 
  Arrium mothballed its Southern Iron mine in April 2015, citing the significant decline in the price of iron ore. During 2015, GWA carried approximately   8,300   carloads of iron ore from the Southern Iron mine and, in total, generated approximately   A$83 million   in freight and freight-related revenues (or approximately   $62 million   at the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2015) under the fixed and variable payment structure that is customary in large contracts in Australia. 
  On April 7, 2016, Arrium announced it had entered into voluntary administration. As a result of this announcement, during the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recorded a   $13.0 million   non-cash charge related to the impairment of GWA's now idle rolling-stock maintenance facility and an allowance for doubtful accounts of   $8.1 million   associated with accounts receivable from Arrium. As a result of the voluntary administration, all payments to GWA associated with the Southern Iron rail haulage agreement have ceased. GWA is in the process of redeploying rolling-stock previously used to provide service under the Southern Iron rail haulage agreement to serve other customers.

     Table of Contents  

GWA continues to receive payments and provide service under GWA's remaining rail haulage agreement to serve several iron ore mines in the Middleback Range and the Whyalla Steelworks operations, which we expect will represent   A$35 million   (or approximately   $27 million   at the exchange rate on September 30, 2016) of annual revenue prospectively. Pending the outcome of the voluntary administration process, GWA could lose some or all of the revenue associated with the remaining rail haulage agreement. In the event of an adverse determination regarding the viability of the Middleback Range or the Whyalla Steelworks operations, or a termination of the remaining rail haulage agreement, all or a portion of GWA's assets deployed to provide service under this agreement, which consist largely of narrow gauge locomotives and wagons, could be redeployed elsewhere in Australia. 
  Europe 
  Freightliner Group Limited:   On March 25, 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding share capital of RailInvest Holding Company Limited, the parent company of London-based Freightliner, pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement dated February 24, 2015. Certain former management shareholders of Freightliner (Management Shareholders) retained an approximate   6%   economic interest in Freightliner in the form of deferred consideration. We expect to settle the deferred consideration by the end of 2020.  
  Headquartered in London, England, Freightliner is an international freight rail operator with operations in the United Kingdom (U.K.), Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and Australia. Freightliner's principal business is located in the U.K. where it is the largest maritime intermodal operator and the second largest freight rail operator, providing service throughout England, Scotland and Wales. In Continental Europe, Freightliner Poland primarily serves aggregates and coal customers in Poland. In addition, Freightliner's ERS subsidiary, based in Rotterdam, provides cross-border intermodal services connecting the northern European ports of Rotterdam, Bremerhaven and Hamburg to key cities in Germany, Poland, Italy and beyond. In Australia, Freightliner currently transports coal and containerized agricultural products for its customers in New South Wales. As of the acquisition date, Freightliner employed approximately   2,500   people worldwide and had a fleet of primarily leased equipment, which included approximately   250   diesel locomotives, approximately   45   electric locomotives and   5,500   railcars. 
  We funded the acquisition with borrowings under the Credit Agreement (see Note   5  ,   Long-Term Debt  , to our Consolidated Financial Statements) and available cash. The foreign exchange rate used to translate the total consideration to United States dollars was   $1.49   for one British pound. The calculation of the total consideration for the Freightliner acquisition is presented below (amounts in thousands): 

For additional information regarding the acquisition of Freightliner, see Note   2  ,   Changes in Operations  , to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  North America 
  Pinsly's Arkansas Division:   On January 5, 2015, we completed the acquisition of certain subsidiaries of Pinsly Railroad Company (Pinsly) that constituted Pinsly's Arkansas Division (Pinsly Arkansas) for   $41.3 million   in cash. We funded the acquisition with borrowings under our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Syndicated Credit Facility Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement). The results of operations from Pinsly Arkansas have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition date within our North American Operations segment. For additional information regarding Pinsly Arkansas, see Note   2  ,   Changes in Operations  , to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating Expenses 
  Total operating expenses for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     $19.6 million  , or   4.6%  , to   $409.2 million  , compared with   $428.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a   $14.3 million   decrease from the net depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar as well as decreases of   $5.5 million   in equipment rents,   $4.4 million   in materials,   $3.0 million   in diesel fuel used in train operations and   $2.8 million   in purchased services. These decreases were partially offset by increases of   $4.8 million   in other expenses, primarily due to corporate development and related costs associated with the GRail and P W transactions,   $3.5 million   in labor and benefits and   $3.0 million   in depreciation and amortization.

  Operating Results by Segment 
  Our various rail operations are organized into   10   operating regions. We present our financial information as three reportable segments: North American Operations, Australian Operations and U.K./European Operations. Each of our segments generates the following three categories of revenues from external customers: freight revenues, freight-related revenues and all other revenues. Our   eight   North American regions are aggregated into one segment as a result of having similar economic and operating characteristics. 
  The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the respective local currency (the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our results of operations.

  Total traffic from our North American Operations   decreased     17,572   carloads, or   4.2%  , for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  .   The decline in traffic was principally due to decreases of 8,169 carloads of coal and coke traffic, 3,549 carloads of pulp and paper traffic, 3,447 carloads of minerals and stone traffic, 2,529 carloads of metals traffic and 2,257 carloads of other traffic, partially offset by 3,014 carloads of agricultural products traffic. All remaining traffic decreased by a net 635 carloads. 
  The following information discusses the significant changes in our North American Operations freight revenues by commodity group excluding the impact of foreign currency. Other changes in average freight revenues per carload in a commodity group can be impacted by changes in customer rates and fuel surcharges, as well as changes in the mix of customer traffic within a commodity group.  
  Average freight revenues per carload from our North American Operations   increased     0.5%   to   $578   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  . A change in the mix of commodities increased average freight revenues per carload by 0.4%, while lower fuel surcharges decreased average freight revenues per carload by 1.7%. Excluding these factors, average freight revenues per carload increased 1.8%. 
  Agricultural products revenues decreased   $0.3 million  , or   0.9%  . Agricultural products average freight revenues per carload decreased 6.4%, which decreased revenues by $1.9 million, while traffic increased 3,014 carloads, or 5.9%, which increased revenues by $1.6 million. The decrease in average freight revenues per carload was primarily driven by changes in the customer mix and lower fuel surcharges. The carload increase was primarily due to increased shipments in the central United States to provide storage for the fall harvest and increased agricultural products shipments in the midwestern and western United States.

Coal and coke revenues decreased   $3.2 million  , or   12.9%  . Coal and coke traffic decreased 8,169 carloads, or 11.5%, which decreased revenues by $2.8 million, and average freight revenues per carload decreased 1.7%, which decreased revenues by $0.4 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower demand for steam coal as a result of competition from natural gas power generation.  
  Metallic ores revenues decreased   $1.5 million  , or   30.6%  , primarily due to a traffic decrease of 1,755 carloads, or 27.9%. The carload decrease was primarily due to the planned idling of an alumina customer facility in the southern United States and lower production at a copper facility. 
  Metals revenues decreased   $2.4 million  , or   9.1%  . Metals traffic decreased 2,529 carloads, or 7.3%, which decreased revenues by $1.9 million, and average freight revenues per carload decreased 2.0%, which decreased revenues by $0.5 million. The carload decrease was primarily due to rail competition, plant production issues and depressed product demand. The decrease in average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to lower fuel surcharges. 
  Minerals and stone revenues decreased   $0.3 million  , or   0.9%  . Minerals and stone traffic decreased 3,447 carloads, or 6.0%, which decreased revenues by $2.0 million, while average freight revenues per carload increased 5.6%, which increased revenues by $1.7 million. The carload decrease was primarily due to weaker rock salt shipments due to the mild 2015 winter and lower frac sand shipments in the northeastern United States, partially offset by stronger aggregates shipments in the southeastern United States. The increase in average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to the change in customer mix.  
  Pulp and paper revenues decreased   $2.5 million  , or   8.4%  , primarily due to a traffic decrease of 3,549 carloads, or 7.8%. The carload decrease was primarily due to truck competition and the closure of several plants we served due to consolidation within the paper industry. 
  Waste revenues increased   $0.8 million  , or   15.3%  , primarily due to a traffic increase of 1,967 carloads or 17.2%. The carload increase was primarily due to new contracts in the western and northeastern United States.   
  Freight revenues from all remaining commodities combined   increased   by a net   $0.1 million  . 
   
  Freight-Related Revenues 
  Freight-related revenues from our North American Operations, which includes revenues from railcar switching, track access fees, crewing services, storage and other ancillary revenues related to the movement of freight,   increased     $5.3 million  , or   9.3%  , to   $62.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily driven by a change in the presentation of revenues from certain of our port terminal operations, which were previously presented net of the related costs incurred. 
   
  All Other Revenues 
  All other revenues from our North American Operations, which includes revenues from third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, property rentals, railroad construction and other ancillary revenues not directly related to the movement of freight,   decreased     $0.5 million  , or   3.1%  , to   $15.8 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
   
  Operating Expenses 
  Total operating expenses from our North American Operations decreased   $1.0 million  , or   0.4%  , to   $223.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $224.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in operating expenses for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to lower freight volumes and effective management of operating costs, partially offset by corporate development and related costs, primarily associated with the P W and GRail transactions.

  The following information discusses the significant changes in operating expenses of our North American Operations excluding the impact of foreign currency appreciation. 
  Labor and benefits expense was   $97.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $93.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $3.5 million  , or   3.7%  . The increase in labor and benefits expense was primarily due to an   increase   in labor costs, partially offset by a decrease in the average number of employees. 
  Equipment rents expense was   $14.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $16.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $2.5 million  , or   14.8%  . The   decrease   was primarily due to reduced car hire expense and reduced railcar lease expense as a result of the purchase of railcars in 2015. 
  Purchased services expense was   $15.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $17.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $2.1 million  , or   11.9%  . The   decrease   was primarily due to a reduction in the level of third-party construction projects. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense was   $37.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $35.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $1.9 million  , or   5.4%  . The   increase   was primarily attributable to capital expenditures in 2015. 
  The cost of diesel fuel used in train operations was   $14.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $16.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $2.2 million  , or   13.6%  . The   decrease   was primarily attributable to a 12.2% decrease in average fuel cost per gallon. 
  Casualties and insurance expense was   $6.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $7.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $1.4 million  , or   18.6%  . The   decrease   was primarily attributable to fewer incidents in the United States during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Materials expense, which primarily consists of the costs of materials purchased for use in repairing and maintaining our track property, locomotives, railcars and other equipment as well as costs for general tools and supplies used in our business, was   $12.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $13.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $1.5 million  , or   10.8%  .

  Total traffic from our Australian Operations   decreased     5,000   carloads, or   10.3%  , for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  . The decline in traffic was principally   due to   decreases of 2,818 carloads of agricultural products traffic, 878 carloads of metallic ores traffic, 657 carloads of minerals and stone traffic and 628 carloads of intermodal traffic.    
  The following information discusses the significant changes in our Australian Operations freight revenues by commodity group excluding the impact of foreign currency. Other changes in average freight revenues per carload in a commodity group can be impacted by changes in customer rates and fuel surcharges, as well as changes in the mix of customer traffic within a commodity group.  
  Average freight revenues per carload from our Australian Operations   decreased     4.8%   to   $671   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  . The decrease in average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to reduced metallic ores shipments. 
  Agricultural products revenues decreased   $1.1 million  , or   21.8%  , primarily due to a traffic decrease of 2,818 carloads, or 24.6%. The carload decrease was due to adverse weather and flooding, low global crop prices, as well as grain diverted by truck to domestic markets in eastern Australia due to weak local harvests in those areas.  
  Intermodal revenues decreased   $1.2 million  , or   6.5%  . Intermodal traffic decreased 628 carloads, or 3.9%, which decreased revenues by $0.7 million, and average freight revenues per carload decreased 2.7%, which decreased revenues by $0.5 million. The carload decrease was primarily due to lower project-related traffic and livestock feed traffic. The decrease in average freight revenues per carload was due to lower fuel surcharges. 
  Metallic ores revenues decreased   $2.5 million  , or   31.2%  . Average freight revenues per carload decreased 18.8%, which decreased revenues by $1.5 million, and traffic decreased 878 carloads, or 15.3%, which decreased revenues by $1.0 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in iron ore and manganese shipments as a result of multiple customer mine closures in 2015, partially offset by shipments from a new iron ore mine customer. 
  Freight revenues from all remaining commodities combined   decreased   by a net   $0.2 million  . 
   
  Freight-Related Revenues 
  Excluding a   $1.2 million   increase due to the impact of foreign currency appreciation, freight-related revenues from our Australian Operations, which includes revenues from railcar switching, track access rights, crewing services, storage and other ancillary revenues related to the movement of freight,   decreased     $3.9 million  , or   14.1%  , to   $23.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $27.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in freight-related revenues was primarily due to the loss of the fixed payments from Arrium associated with our rail haulage agreement to serve their Southern Iron mine that is now closed, partially offset by increased switching revenues due to higher export coal shipments.

All Other Revenues 
  Excluding a   $0.1 million   increase due to the impact of foreign currency appreciation, all other revenues from our Australian Operations, which includes revenues from third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, property rentals and other ancillary revenues not directly related to the movement of freight,   decreased     $0.7 million  , or   33.5%  , to   $1.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $2.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to reduced third-party railcar and locomotive repair revenues resulting from customer mine closures. 
   
  Operating Expenses 
  Total operating expenses from our Australian Operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $3.7 million  , or   8.1%  , to   $49.8 million  , compared with   $46.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in operating expenses for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to   $2.9 million   of corporate development and related costs, primarily associated with the GRail Transactions, and a   $2.1 million   increase due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar, partially offset by effective management of operating costs. 
  The following table sets forth operating expenses from our Australian Operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands):

The cost of diesel fuel used in train operations was   $5.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $6.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $0.8 million  , or   12.8%  . The   decrease   consisted of a $1.5 million decrease primarily due to a 23.0% decrease in average fuel cost per gallon, partially offset by a $0.7 million increase due to a 13.1% increase in gallons. 
  Other expenses were   $5.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $1.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $3.5 million  . The increase was primarily due to   $2.9 million   of corporate development and related costs primarily associated with the GRail Transactions. 
  Operating Income/Operating Ratio 
  Our Australian Operations had operating income of   $4.4 million   for   the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with operating income of   $15.0 million     for   the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Operating income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   included   $2.9 million   of corporate development and related costs, primarily associated with the GRail Transactions. The operating ratio was   91.9%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   75.5%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

  Total traffic from our U.K./European Operations   decreased     10,264   carloads, or   3.4%  , for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  .   The decline in traffic was principally due to decreases of 8,402 carloads of coal and coke traffic (primarily in the U.K. and Poland) and 4,106 carloads of intermodal traffic (primarily in the U.K.), partially offset by an increase of 1,761 carloads of minerals and stone traffic and 483 carloads of agricultural products traffic. 
  The following information discusses the significant changes in our U.K./European Operations freight revenues by commodity group excluding the impact of foreign currency. Other changes in average freight revenues per carload in a commodity group can be impacted by changes in customer rates and fuel surcharges, as well as changes in the mix of customer traffic within a commodity group.  
  Average freight revenues per carload from our U.K./European Operations decreased   2.0%   to   $300   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  . 
  Coal and coke revenues decreased   $2.6 million  , or   44.5%  , primarily due to a traffic decrease of 8,402 carloads, or 47.5%, which decreased revenues by $2.9 million. The carload decrease was primarily due to lower demand for steam coal in the U.K. as a result of competition from natural gas power generation. 
  Intermodal revenues decreased   $2.8 million  , or   3.9%  . Intermodal average freight revenues per carload decreased 2.1%, which decreased revenues by $1.6 million, and traffic decreased 4,106 carloads, or 1.7%, which decreased revenues by $1.2 million. The decrease in carloads was primarily due to congestion in the port of Felixstowe, which though moderating, is expected to continue into the fourth quarter.  
  Freight revenues from all remaining commodities combined   increased   by   $0.6 million  .  
   
  Freight-Related Revenues 
  Freight-related revenues from our U.K./European Operations include port switching as well as traction service (or hook and pull). Traction service requires us to provide locomotives and drivers to move a customer's train between specified origin and destination points. Freight-related revenues in the U.K./Europe also include infrastructure services, where we operate work trains for the track infrastructure owner, drayage and other ancillary revenues related to the movement of freight. With the exception of infrastructure services, which are primarily in the U.K., freight-related revenues from our U.K./European Operations are primarily associated with the Continental Europe intermodal business. 
  Excluding a   $5.9 million     decrease   due to the impact of foreign currency depreciation, freight-related revenues from our U.K./European Operations   decreased     $12.7 million  , or   22.5%  , to   $43.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $56.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a decline in Continental Europe intermodal services as unprofitable routes were rationalized, as well as lower utilization of scheduled intermodal services along certain routes. Also, in the U.K., infrastructure services declined as a result of a delay in track projects.

  The following information discusses the significant changes in operating expenses of our U.K./European Operations excluding a decrease of   $16.4 million   due to the impact of foreign currency depreciation. 
  Equipment rents expense was   $21.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $22.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $1.4 million  , or   6.1%  . The   decrease   was primarily due to reduced locomotive costs as a result of lower traffic and reduced railcar maintenance, partially offset by a reclassification of maintenance activities on certain leased equipment from materials expense in 2015 to equipment rents expense in 2016. 
  Purchased services expense was   $29.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $31.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $1.5 million  , or   4.9%  . The   decrease   was primarily due to a decrease in handling, crewing and other third-party operating services resulting from reduced Continental Europe intermodal services.  
  Depreciation and amortization expense was   $6.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $5.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $1.4 million  , or   27.1%  . The   increase   was primarily attributable to capital expenditures in 2015. 
  The cost of electricity used in train operations was   $3.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $4.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $1.7 million  , or   34.5%  . The   decrease   was primarily due to reduced Continental Europe intermodal services.

Materials expense, which primarily consists of the costs of materials purchased for use in repairing and maintaining our locomotives, railcars and other equipment as well as costs for general tools and supplies used in our business, was   $4.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $7.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $2.6 million  , or   35.3%  . The   decrease   was primarily due to a reclassification of maintenance activities on certain leased equipment from materials expense in 2015 to equipment rents expense in 2016. 
  Trackage rights expense was   $10.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $12.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $1.4 million  , or   11.6%  . The   decrease   was primarily due to reduced Continental Europe intermodal services.  
  Other expenses were   $6.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $4.8 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $1.8 million  , or   38.0%  . The   increase   was primarily due to the change in the estimated fair value of deferred consideration. For additional information regarding deferred consideration, see Note   7  ,   Fair Value of Financial Instruments  , to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Operating Income 
  Our U.K./European Operations had operating income of   $0.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with operating income of   $12.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in operating income from our U.K./European Operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to lower U.K. intermodal and infrastructure services of approximately $4 million resulting from port congestion and timing of rail projects and a loss of approximately $3 million from Continental Europe intermodal due to business restructuring, exiting traffic lanes and surplus equipment. In addition, our U.K. coal business had residual surplus equipment costs of approximately $2 million and our overall U.K./European Operations had a negative impact from the depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar of approximately $2 million.

  Consolidated Operating Results 
  Operating Revenues 
  The following table sets forth our operating revenues and carloads by new operations and existing operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands): 

Operating Expenses 
  Total operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $53.0 million  , or   4.4%  , to   $1,249.0 million  , compared with   $1,195.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase included   $126.9 million   from new operations, partially offset by a   decrease   of   $73.8 million   from existing operations. The decrease from existing operations was primarily due to a   $30.8 million   decrease from the depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar as well as decreases of   $24.1 million   in the cost of diesel fuel used in train operations,   $12.6 million   in labor and benefits,   $12.5 million   in equipment rents,   $11.8 million   in materials and   $8.3 million   in purchased services. These decreases were partially offset by an   $8.8 million   increase in depreciation and amortization and   $6.3 million   of restructuring costs. Total operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   also included a   $13.0 million   non-cash write-down of a rolling-stock maintenance facility and the write-off of accounts receivable of   $8.1 million  , both of which were associated with an iron ore customer in Australia that entered into voluntary administration in April 2016.

  Total traffic from our North American Operations decreased   84,858   carloads, or   6.8%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  . The decline in traffic was principally due to decreases of 56,311 carloads of coal and coke traffic, 11,140 carloads of minerals and stone traffic, 9,320 carloads of pulp and paper traffic, 4,493 carloads of other traffic, 3,873 carloads of chemicals and plastics traffic and 3,668 carloads of agricultural products traffic, partially offset by increases of 4,256 carloads of waste traffic and 2,321 carloads of lumber and forest products traffic.   All remaining traffic decreased by a net 2,630 carloads. 
  The following information discusses the significant changes in our North American Operations freight revenues by commodity group excluding the impact of foreign currency. Other changes in average freight revenues per carload in a commodity group can be impacted by changes in customer rates and fuel surcharges, as well as changes in the mix of customer traffic within a commodity group. 
  Average freight revenues per carload from our North American Operations increased   1.6%   to   $582   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  . A change in the mix of business increased average freight revenues per carload by 1.8%, while lower fuel surcharges decreased average freight revenues per carload by 2.8%. Excluding these factors, average freight revenues per carload from our North American Operations increased 2.6%.  
  Agricultural products revenues decreased   $9.8 million  , or   10.4%  . Agricultural products average freight revenues per carload decreased 8.3%, which decreased revenues by $7.9 million, and traffic decreased 3,668 carloads, or 2.2%, which decreased revenues by $1.9 million. The decrease in average freight revenues per carload was primarily driven by a change in the mix of business and lower fuel surcharges. The carload decrease was primarily due to decreased grain shipments in the United States as a result of depressed grain prices and a decrease in export traffic due to a strong United States dollar.

  Freight revenues from all remaining commodities combined   decreased   by a net   $3.0 million  . 
   
  Freight-Related Revenues 
  Excluding a   $0.8 million   decrease due to the impact of foreign currency depreciation, freight-related revenues from our North American Operations, which includes revenues from railcar switching, track access rights, crewing services, storage and other ancillary revenues related to the movement of freight, increased   $15.0 million  , or   8.8%  , to   $184.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily driven by a change in the presentation of revenues from certain of our port terminal railroad operations, which were previously presented net of the related costs incurred and an increase in storage revenue. 
   
  All Other Revenues 
  Excluding a   $0.5 million   decrease due to the impact of foreign currency depreciation, all other revenues from our North American Operations, which includes revenues from third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, property rentals, railroad construction and other ancillary revenues not directly related to the movement of freight, decreased   $0.9 million  , or   1.8%  , to   $48.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
   
  Operating Expenses 
  Total operating expenses from our North American Operations decreased   $40.5 million  , or   5.6%  , to   $678.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $718.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to lower freight volumes and effective management of costs. In addition,   $14.0 million   of acquisition and integration costs associated with the Freightliner acquisition were incurred in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and the depreciation of the Canadian dollar relative to the United States dollar resulted in a   $3.4 million   decrease in operating expenses.

The following table sets forth our Australian Operations freight revenues, carloads and average freight revenues per carload for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands, except average freight revenues per carload):   

  * Constant currency amounts reflect the prior period results translated at the current period exchange rates. 
  Total traffic from our Australian Operations decreased   20,654   carloads, or   13.4%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  . The traffic was entirely from existing operations, as Freightliner Australia revenues are exclusively freight-related and all other revenues. The decline in traffic was principally due to decreases of 14,425 carloads of metallic ores traffic, 8,153 carloads of agricultural products traffic and 1,691 carloads of intermodal traffic  , partially offset by an increase of 3,634 carloads of minerals and stone traffic. 
  The following information discusses the significant changes in our Australian Operations freight revenues by commodity group excluding the impact of foreign currency. Other changes in average freight revenues per carload in a commodity group can be impacted by changes in customer rates and fuel surcharges, as well as changes in the mix of customer traffic within a commodity group. 
  Average freight revenues per carload from our Australian Operations decreased   19.1%   to   $600   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  . The decrease in average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to decreased metallic ores shipments. 
  Agricultural products revenues decreased   $4.3 million  , or   24.4%  . Agricultural products traffic decreased 8,153 carloads, or 20.0%, which decreased revenues by $3.3 million, and average freight revenues per carload decreased 5.6%, which decreased revenues by $1.0 million. The decrease in carloads was primarily driven by low global crop prices affecting export volumes and carloads diverted by truck to domestic markets in eastern Australia due to weak local harvests in those areas. The decrease in average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to a change in the mix of business. 
  Intermodal revenues decreased   $3.6 million  , or   6.8%  . Intermodal traffic decreased 1,691 carloads, or 3.7%, which decreased revenues by $1.9 million, and average freight revenues per carload decreased 3.3%, which decreased revenues by $1.7 million. The carload decrease was primarily due to lower project-related traffic and livestock feed traffic. The decrease in average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to lower fuel surcharges.  
  Metallic ores revenues decreased   $26.5 million  , or   69.7%  . Metallic ores traffic decreased 14,425 carloads, or 61.1%, which decreased revenues by $18.1 million, and average freight revenues per carload decreased 22.2%, which decreased revenues by $8.4 million. These decreases were primarily driven by a decrease in iron ore and manganese shipments as a result of multiple customer mine closures in 2015.  
  Freight revenues from all remaining commodities combined   increased   by less than $0.1 million.

Freight-Related Revenues 
  Excluding a   $0.8 million   decrease due to the impact of foreign currency depreciation, freight-related revenues from our Australian Operations, which includes revenues from railcar switching, track access rights, crewing services, storage and other ancillary revenues related to the movement of freight,   increased     $14.7 million  , or   23.9%  , to   $76.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $61.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in freight-related revenues consisted of   $10.9 million   from new operations and   $3.8 million   from existing operations. The increase in freight-related revenues from existing operations was primarily due to temporary shipments of manganese stockpiled at a customer mine facility that will not recur unless the mine is reopened in the future and increased switching revenues, partially offset by lower Southern Iron fixed payments received from Arrium that ceased in April 2016 when Arrium filed for voluntary administration. 
   
  All Other Revenues 
  Excluding a   $0.2 million   decrease due to the impact of foreign currency depreciation, all other revenues from our Australian Operations, which includes revenues from third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, property rentals and other ancillary revenues not directly related to the movement of freight,   decreased     $2.0 million  , or   29.8%  , to   $4.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $6.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to reduced third-party railcar and locomotive repair revenues. 
   
  Operating Expenses 
  Total operating expenses from our Australian Operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $15.8 million  , or   11.0%  , to   $159.2 million  , compared with   $143.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase consisted of   $9.8 million   from new operations and   $6.0 million   from existing operations. The increase from existing operations included   $21.1 million   related to the impairment of a rolling-stock maintenance facility and associated write-off of accounts receivable in the first quarter of 2016 resulting from an iron ore customer entering voluntary administration, partially offset by a   $3.8 million   decrease due to the depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar. In addition, lower freight volumes and effective management of operating costs further reduced operating expenses from our Australian Operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

The following information discusses the significant changes in operating expenses of our Australian Operations excluding a decrease of   $3.8 million   due to the impact of foreign currency depreciation. 
  Labor and benefits expense was   $49.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $50.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $1.4 million  , or   2.7%  . The   decrease   consisted of   $5.5 million   from existing operations, partially offset by   $4.1 million   from new operations. The   decrease   from existing operations was primarily due to a decrease in the average number of employees as a result of changes made to the operating plans in Australia associated with mine closures and severance costs recorded in 2015. 
  Equipment rents expense was   $4.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $9.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $4.2 million  , or   46.3%  . The   decrease   consisted of   $4.8 million   from existing operations, partially offset by   $0.6 million   from new operations. The   decrease   from existing operations was primarily attributable to a change in classification of maintenance expense associated with certain leased equipment from equipment rents expense in 2015 to purchased services expense in 2016, as well as reduced leased freight car expense associated with lower grain shipments. 
  Purchased services expense was   $17.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $15.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $2.0 million  , or   13.0%  . The increase consisted of   $1.7 million   from new operations and   $0.3 million   from existing operations. The   increase   was primarily attributable to a change in classification of maintenance expense associated with certain leased equipment from equipment rents expense in 2015 to purchased services expense in 2016, partially offset by insourcing maintenance of way activities in 2015. 
  The cost of diesel fuel used in train operations was   $14.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $15.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $1.6 million  , or   10.1%  . The   decrease   consisted of   $3.5 million   from existing operations, partially offset by   $2.0 million   from new operations. The   decrease   from existing operations was primarily attributable to a 27.0% decrease in average fuel cost per gallon. 
  Trackage rights expense was   $7.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $10.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $3.3 million  , or   31.2%  . The decrease consisted of   $3.5 million   from existing operations, partially offset by   $0.3 million   from new operations. The   decrease   from existing operations was primarily attributable to decreased shipments as a result of a customer iron ore mine closure in South Australia. 
  Net loss on the sale and impairment of assets for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $13.0 million   was primarily related to the impairment of a maintenance facility resulting from an iron ore customer entering voluntary administration.  
  Other expenses were   $18.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $5.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $13.4 million  . The increase consisted of   $13.1 million   from existing operations and   $0.4 million   from new operations. The   increase   from existing operations was primarily due to the write-off of accounts receivable associated with an iron ore customer entering into voluntary administration and increased corporate development and related costs primarily associated with the GRail Transactions. 
  Operating Income 
  Operating income from our Australian Operations was   $2.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $44.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Australian Operations recorded charges of   $21.1 million  , including a $13.0 million non-cash charge related to the impairment of a rolling-stock maintenance facility and associated write-off of accounts receivable of $8.1 million, resulting from an iron ore customer entering into voluntary administration.

Freight-Related Revenues 
  Freight-related revenues from our U.K./European Operations include port switching as well as traction service (or hook and pull). Traction service requires us to provide locomotives and drivers to move a customer's train between specified origin and destination points. Freight-related revenues in the U.K./Europe also include infrastructure services, where we operate work trains for the track infrastructure owner, drayage and other ancillary revenues related to the movement of freight. With the exception of infrastructure services, which are primarily in the U.K., freight-related revenues from our U.K./European Operations are primarily associated with the Continental Europe intermodal business. 
  Excluding a   $7.7 million   decrease due to the impact of foreign currency depreciation, freight-related revenues from our U.K./European Operations increased   $14.8 million  , or   12.3%  , to   $135.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $121.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in freight-related revenues consisted of   $38.5 million   from new operations, partially offset by a decrease of   $23.7 million   from existing operations. The decrease from existing operations was primarily due to a decline in Continental Europe intermodal services.  
   
   All Other Revenues

  Total operating expenses from our U.K./European Operations were   $411.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $333.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $77.7 million  , or   23.3%  . The increase included   $117.1 million   from new operations, partially offset by a decrease of   $39.4 million   from existing operations. The decrease from existing operations included a   $23.6 million   decrease due to the impact of foreign currency depreciation and   $4.7 million   of restructuring costs, primarily related to the U.K. coal business.

The following information discusses the significant changes in operating expenses of our U.K./European Operations excluding a decrease of   $23.6 million   due to the impact of foreign currency depreciation. 
  Labor and benefits expense was   $130.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $90.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $39.6 million  , which was primarily due to new operations.  
  Equipment rents expense was   $65.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $46.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $18.9 million  . The   increase   consisted of   $19.3 million   from new operations, partially offset by a   decrease   of   $0.4 million   from existing operations. The   decrease   from existing operations was primarily due to a decline in lease expense due to the return of excess leased equipment and reduced maintenance expense as a result of lower traffic, partially offset by a reclassification of maintenance activities on certain leased equipment from materials expense in 2015 to equipment rents expense in 2016. 
  Purchased services expense was   $84.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $71.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $13.6 million  . The   increase   consisted of   $22.9 million   from new operations, partially offset by a   decrease   of   $9.4 million   from existing operations. The   decrease   from existing operations was primarily due to a decrease in handling, crewing and other third-party operating services resulting from reduced Continental Europe intermodal services. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense was   $19.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $11.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $8.4 million  . The   increase   consisted of   $5.6 million   from new operations and   $2.8 million   from existing operations. The   increase   from existing operations was primarily attributable to capital expenditures in 2015. 
  The cost of diesel fuel used in train operations was   $28.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $23.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $4.6 million  . The increase consisted of   $7.0 million   from new operations, partially offset by a   decrease   of   $2.4 million   from existing operations. The   decrease   from existing operations was primarily due to a 15.2% decrease in average fuel cost per gallon. 
  The cost of electricity used in train operations was   $9.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $10.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $0.3 million  . The   decrease   consisted of   $3.1 million   from existing operations, partially offset by   $2.7 million   from new operations. The   decrease   from existing operations was primarily due to reduced Continental Europe intermodal services. 
  Materials expense was   $16.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $15.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $0.7 million  . The   increase   consisted of   $5.6 million   from new operations, partially offset by a   decrease   of   $4.9 million   from existing operations. The   decrease   from existing operations was primarily due to a reclassification of maintenance activities on certain leased equipment from materials expense in 2015 to equipment rents expense in 2016. 
  Trackage rights expense was   $30.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $26.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $4.3 million  . The   increase   consisted of   $8.0 million   from new operations, partially offset by a   decrease   of   $3.7 million   from existing operations. The   decrease   from existing operations was primarily due to reduced Continental Europe intermodal services.  
  Restructuring costs for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $4.7 million   were primarily related to the restructuring of the U.K. coal business. 
  Other expenses were   $18.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $11.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $6.9 million  . The   increase   consisted of   $4.7 million   from new operations and   $2.3 million   from existing operations. The   increase   from existing operations was primarily due to the change in the estimated fair value of deferred consideration. For additional information regarding deferred consideration, see Note   7  ,   Fair Value of Financial Instruments  , to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating (Loss)/Income 
  Our U.K./European Operations had an operating loss of   $2.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with operating income of   $21.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in operating income from our U.K./European Operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to a loss of approximately $10 million from Continental Europe intermodal resulting from business restructuring, exiting traffic lanes and surplus equipment and approximately $4 million of lower U.K. intermodal and infrastructure services due to port congestion and timing of rail projects. In addition, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our U.K./European Operations had   $4.7 million   of restructuring costs, primarily related to the U.K. coal business, and a negative impact from the depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar of approximately $1 million.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We had cash and cash equivalents of   $26.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Based on current expectations, we believe our cash and other liquid assets, anticipated future cash flows, availability under the Credit Agreement, access to debt and equity capital markets and sources of available financing will be sufficient to fund expected operating, capital and debt service requirements and other financial commitments for the foreseeable future. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had long-term debt, including current portion, totaling   $2.1 billion  , which was   44%   of our total capitalization, and   $533.3 million   of unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement. At   December 31, 2015  , we had long-term debt, including current portion, totaling   $2.3 billion  , which was   48%   of our total capitalization. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we generated   $303.6 million   and   $344.3 million  , respectively, of cash from operating activities. Changes in working capital decreased net cash flows by   $30.6 million   and   $7.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our cash used in investing activities was   $117.2 million   and   $986.1 million  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primary drivers of cash used in investing activities were   $159.5 million   of cash used for capital expenditures, including   $9.3 million   for new business investments, partially offset by   $30.0 million   of cash received from grants from outside parties for capital spending and   $10.3 million   of insurance proceeds for the replacement of assets. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primary drivers of cash used in investing activities were   $735.6 million   of cash paid for acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Freightliner and Pinsly Arkansas,   $276.2 million   of cash used for capital expenditures, including new business investments of   $58.6 million  , and   $18.7 million   of net cash paid for the settlement of the foreign currency forward purchase contracts related to the acquisition of Freightliner, partially offset by   $31.5 million   in cash received from grants from outside parties for capital spending and   $9.7 million   of insurance proceeds for the replacement of assets. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our cash used in financing activities was   $197.7 million  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , our cash provided by financing activities was   $630.7 million  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the primary driver of cash used in financing activities was a net decrease in outstanding debt of   $200.6 million  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the primary driver of cash flows provided by financing activities was net proceeds of   $627.1 million   primarily related to borrowings from the refinancing of the Credit Agreement in conjunction with our acquisition of Freightliner. 
  Credit Agreement 
  In anticipation of our acquisition of Freightliner, we entered into the Credit Agreement on March 20, 2015. The credit facilities under the Credit Agreement are comprised of a   $1,782.0 million   United States term loan, an   A$324.6 million   (or   $252.5 million   at the exchange rate on March 20, 2015) Australian term loan, a    101.7 million   (or   $152.2 million   at the exchange rate on March 20, 2015) U.K. term loan and a   $625.0 million   revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit and swingline loans. The maturity date of each of our credit facilities under the Credit Agreement is   March 31, 2020  . On September 30, 2015, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment) to the Credit Agreement. The Amendment added a senior secured leverage ratio covenant that requires us to comply with maximum ratios of senior secured indebtedness, subject, if applicable, to netting of certain cash and cash equivalents to earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). For additional information regarding our Credit Agreement and Credit Agreement Amendment, see Note   5  ,   Long-Term Debt  , to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Acquisition of Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (P W) 
  On   November 1, 2016  , we completed the acquisition of Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (P W) for   $25.00   per share, or   $126.2 million  . Immediately following the closing of the acquisition, control of the P W shares was placed into a voting trust, which will remain in effect until the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) issues its decision on our pending application to control P W. Upon receipt of STB approval, P W would be managed as part of our Northeast Region. The acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. For additional information regarding the P W acquisition, see Note   15  ,   Subsequent Events  , to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Agreement to Acquire GRail and Partner with MIRA 
    On   October 20, 2016  , we announced that our subsidiary, GWA, has entered into agreements to acquire GRail for   A$1.14 billion   (or approximately   $866 million   at an exchange rate of   $0.76 for one Australian dollar  ) and concurrently issue a   49%   equity stake in GWA to funds managed by MIRA. The GRail Transactions are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to Australian Foreign Investment Review Board approval. To create an   A$2 billion   enterprise value partnership, we and MIRA are contributing a combined   A$1.3 billion   in the form of cash, shareholder loans and contributed equity, and GWA is entering into a new five-year   A$690 million   senior secured term loan facility that is non-recourse to us and MIRA. The contributions and the proceeds from borrowings under GWA's new senior secured term loan facility will be used to, among other things, acquire GRail for   A$1.14 billion  , repay GWA's existing   A$250 million   term loan (under our Credit Agreement) and pay   A$32 million   of transaction costs. For additional information regarding the GRail Transactions, see Note   15  ,   Subsequent Events  , to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  2016   Budgeted Capital Expenditures 
  The following table sets forth our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands): 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $153.7 million   in aggregate capital expenditures related to current year projects of which we paid   $138.8 million   in cash and accrued   $14.9 million   in accounts payable as of   September 30, 2016  . Of the   $17.8 million   of grants from outside parties related to these current year projects, we received   $6.8 million   in cash and we expect to receive an additional   $11.1 million  , which was included in outstanding grant receivables from outside parties as of   September 30, 2016  .

The following table sets forth our capital expenditures by segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands):   

  Cash of   $159.5 million   paid for purchases of property and equipment during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   consisted of   $138.8 million   for   2016   capital projects and   $20.7 million   related to capital expenditures accrued in   2015  . Grant proceeds from outside parties during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   consisted of   $6.8 million   for grants related to   2016   capital expenditures and   $23.2 million   for grants related to our capital expenditures from prior years. 
  We periodically receive grants for the upgrade and construction of rail lines and the upgrade of locomotives from federal, provincial, state and local agencies and other outside parties in the United States, Canada and Australia. These grants typically reimburse us for 50% to 100% of the actual cost of specific projects. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  An off-balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation, agreement or transaction involving an unconsolidated entity under which we (1) have made guarantees, (2) have a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets, or a similar arrangement, that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets, (3) have an obligation under certain derivative instruments or (4) have any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in such an entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing or hedging services with us.  
  Our off-balance sheet arrangements as of   December 31, 2015   consisted of operating lease obligations, as well as credit/payment guarantees. There were no material changes in our off-balance sheet arrangements during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Impact of Foreign Currencies on Operating Revenues and Expenses 
  When comparing the effects of average foreign currency exchange rates on operating revenues and operating expenses during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   with the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , foreign currency translation had a net negative impact on our consolidated operating revenues and a net positive impact on our consolidated operating expenses. Currency effects related to operating revenues and expenses are presented within the discussion of these respective items included within this Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
  The following table reflects the average exchange rates used to translate the foreign entities respective local currency results of operations into United States dollars for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
     Except as noted below, during the    nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes to the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk previously disclosed in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K (see Note   6  ,   Derivative Financial Instruments  , to our Consolidated Financial Statements). 
  On   September 30, 2016  , we amended our forward starting swaps which included moving the mandatory settlement date from   September 30, 2016   to   September 30, 2020  , changing from 3-month LIBOR to 1-month LIBOR and adjusting the fixed rate. The amended forward starting swaps continue to qualify for hedge accounting (see Note   6  ,   Derivative Financial Instruments  ). 
   
           ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
     Disclosure Controls and Procedures     We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting     On March 25, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Freightliner. We extended our oversight and monitoring processes that support our internal control over financial reporting, as appropriate, to include Freightliner's financial position, results of operations and cash flow into our consolidated financial statements from the March 25, 2015 date of acquisition through   September 30, 2016  . We are continuing to integrate the acquired operations of Freightliner into our overall internal control over financial reporting and related processes. Except as disclosed in this paragraph, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as the term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
   
           ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
     From time to time, we are a defendant in certain lawsuits resulting from our operations in the ordinary course as the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation, including those related to property damage, personal injury, freight loss, labor and employment, environmental and other matters. We maintain insurance policies to mitigate the financial risk associated with such claims.  
  Any material changes to pending litigation or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage, personal injury and environmental liability or other claims against us that are not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
  Management believes there are adequate provisions in the financial statements for any probable liabilities that may result from disposition of the pending lawsuits. Based upon currently available information, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to our results of operations or have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. 
   
           ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS. 
     For a discussion of our potential risks or uncertainties, please see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the risk factor described below. 
  Political and economic uncertainty arising from a majority of voters approving a referendum for the United Kingdom to exit the European Union could adversely impact our operations and financial results. 
  In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as Brexit. As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government, subject to a vote of the British Parliament, will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the E.U. A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the E.U., undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the E.U. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. would have and how such withdrawal would affect us. Our U.K./European Operations represented approximately   28%   of our consolidated revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the weakening of the British pound against the United States dollar. During periods of a weakening British pound, our reported international revenues are reduced because the British pound translates into fewer United States dollars. The long term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Any of the potential effects of Brexit could have unpredictable consequences for credit markets and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial performance. 
  Other than with respect to the risk factor discussed above, there have been no other material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Exhibit 

Exhibit 31.1 
  Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a) Certification of Principal Executive Officer 
  I, John C. Hellmann, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016  , of Genesee   Wyoming Inc. (the "registrant"); 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;
