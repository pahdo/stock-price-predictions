SPECTRA ENERGY CORP 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  1. General 
  The terms  we,   our,   us  and  Spectra Energy  as used in this report refer collectively to Spectra Energy Corp and its subsidiaries unless the context suggests otherwise. These terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any separate legal entity within Spectra Energy. The term  Spectra Energy Partners  refers to our Spectra Energy Partners operating segment. The term  SEP  refers to Spectra Energy Partners, LP, our master limited partnership. 
  On September 6, 2016, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Enbridge Inc. (Enbridge) under which Enbridge and Spectra Energy will combine in a stock-for-stock merger transaction, which values Spectra Energy s stock at approximately   $28 billion  , based on the closing price of Enbridge s common shares as of   September 2, 2016  . This transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Spectra Energy and Enbridge and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to shareholder and certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. 
  Upon completion of the proposed merger, Spectra Energy shareholders will receive   0.984   Enbridge common shares for each share of Spectra Energy stock they own. The consideration to be received by Spectra Energy shareholders is valued at   $40.33   per Spectra Energy share, based on the closing price of Enbridge common shares as of   September 2, 2016  , representing an approximate   11.5%   premium to the closing price of Spectra Energy stock as of   September 2, 2016  . Upon completion of the merger, Enbridge shareholders are expected to own approximately   57%   of the combined company and Spectra Energy shareholders are expected to own approximately   43%  . 
  Nature of Operations.   Spectra Energy Corp, through its subsidiaries and equity affiliates, owns and operates a large and diversified portfolio of complementary natural gas-related energy assets, and owns and operates a crude oil pipeline system that connects Canadian and United States (U.S.) producers to refineries in the U.S. Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions. We currently operate in three key areas of the natural gas industry: gathering and processing, transmission and storage, and distribution. We provide transmission and storage of natural gas to customers in various regions of the northeastern and southeastern U.S., the Maritime Provinces in Canada, the Pacific Northwest in the U.S. and Canada, and in the province of Ontario, Canada. We also provide natural gas sales and distribution services to retail customers in Ontario, and natural gas gathering and processing services to customers in western Canada. We also own a   50%   interest in DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream), based in Denver, Colorado, one of the leading natural gas gatherers in the U.S. and one of the largest U.S. producers and marketers of natural gas liquids (NGLs). 
  Basis of Presentation.   The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries, after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form  10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to fairly present our results of operations and financial position. Amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations are not necessarily indicative of amounts expected for the respective annual periods due to the effects of seasonal temperature variations on energy consumption, primarily in our gas distribution operations, as well as changing commodity prices on certain of our processing operations and other factors. 
  Use of Estimates.   To conform with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S., we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these estimates are based on our best available knowledge at the time, actual results could differ. 
   
  2. Disposition 
  On August 4, 2016, Westcoast Energy Inc. (Westcoast) completed the sale of its ownership interests in the Empress NGL operations (Empress) to Plains Midstream Canada ULC. Consideration received by Westcoast in this transaction was approximately   $204 million   in cash, including approximately   $51 million   for inventory and working capital. The total consideration is subject to final working capital adjustments, which are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. The sale resulted in a pre-tax loss of less than   $1 million   and a tax benefit of   $27 million  , which are reflected in Operating, Maintenance and Other and Income Tax Expense, respectively, on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

3. Business Segments 
  We manage our business in   four   reportable segments: Spectra Energy Partners, Distribution, Western Canada Transmission   Processing and Field Services. The remainder of our business operations is presented as  Other,  and consists of unallocated corporate costs and employee benefit plan assets and liabilities, 100%-owned captive insurance subsidiaries and other miscellaneous activities. 
  Our chief operating decision maker (CODM) regularly reviews financial information about each of these segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. There is no aggregation within our reportable business segments. 
  Spectra Energy s presentation of its Spectra Energy Partners segment is reflective of the parent-level focus by our CODM, considering the resource allocation and governance provisions associated with SEP s master limited partnership structure. SEP maintains a capital and cash management structure that is separate from Spectra Energy s, is self-funding and maintains its own lines of bank credit and cash management accounts. From a Spectra Energy perspective, our CODM evaluates the Spectra Energy Partners segment as a whole, without regard to any of SEP s individual businesses. 
  Spectra Energy Partners provides transmission, storage and gathering of natural   gas, as well as the transportation of crude oil through interstate pipeline systems for customers in various regions of the midwestern, northeastern and southern U.S. and Canada.   The natural gas transmission and storage operations are primarily subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The crude oil transportation operations are primarily subject to regulation by the FERC in the   U.S.   and the National Energy Board (NEB) in Canada. Our Spectra Energy Partners segment is composed of the operations of SEP, less governance costs, which are included in  Other.  
  Distribution provides retail natural gas distribution service in Ontario, Canada, as well as natural gas transmission and storage services to other utilities and energy market participants. These services are provided by Union Gas Limited (Union Gas), and are primarily subject to the rules and regulations of the Ontario Energy Board (OEB). 
  Western Canada Transmission   Processing provides transmission of natural gas and natural gas gathering and processing services to customers in western Canada, the northern tier of the   U.S.   and the Maritime Provinces in Canada. This segment conducts business mostly through BC Pipeline, BC Field Services, Canadian Midstream and Maritimes   Northeast Pipeline Limited Partnership (M N Canada). BC Pipeline, BC Field Services and M N Canada operations are primarily subject to the rules and regulations of the NEB. See Note 2 for discussion related to the sale of Empress on August 4, 2016. 
  Field Services gathers, compresses, treats, processes, transports, stores and sells natural gas, produces, fractionates, transports, stores and sells NGLs, recovers and sells condensate, and trades and markets natural gas and NGLs. It conducts operations through DCP Midstream, which is owned   50%   by us and   50%   by Phillips 66. DCP Midstream gathers raw natural gas through gathering systems connecting to several interstate and intrastate natural gas and NGL pipeline systems, one natural gas storage facility and one NGL storage facility. DCP Midstream operates in a diverse number of regions, including the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Niobrara/DJ Basin and the Midcontinent. DCP Midstream Partners, LP (DCP Partners) is a publicly traded master limited partnership, of which DCP Midstream acts as general partner. As of   September 30, 2016  , DCP Midstream had an approximate   21%   ownership interest in DCP Partners, including DCP Midstream s limited partner and general partner interests. 
  Our reportable segments offer different products and services and are managed separately as business units. Management evaluates segment performance based on earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed at the parent-company levels, so the associated gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and interest and dividend income are excluded from the segments  EBITDA. Our segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner. Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for on the same basis as transactions with unaffiliated third parties.

4. Regulatory Matters 
  Union Gas.   In December 2015, Union Gas filed an application with the OEB for the disposition of the 2014 demand side management (DSM) deferral and variance account balances. As a result of this application, Union Gas has a receivable from customers of approximately   $9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $8 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , which is reflected as Current Assets Other on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In June 2016, the OEB approved Union Gas  application as filed and Union Gas has begun to recover the receivable from ratepayers effective October 1, 2016. 
  In March 2016, Union Gas filed a Draft Rate Order with the OEB for rates effective January 1, 2016 based on the OEB s February 24, 2016 updated Decision and Order on the 2015-2020 DSM Plan. In May 2016, a decision from the OEB was received approving recovery from ratepayers of approximately   $19 million   effective January 1, 2016 with an implementation date of July 1, 2016. 
  In April 2016, Union Gas filed an application with the OEB for the annual disposition of the 2015 deferral account balances. As a result, Union Gas has a net receivable from customers of approximately   $18 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which is primarily reflected as Current Assets Other on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Union Gas filed a Settlement Proposal with the OEB in July 2016 reflecting a full settlement on all issues in the proceeding. In August 2016, the OEB approved the Settlement Proposal as filed. Union Gas has begun to implement the disposition of the balances effective October 1, 2016. 
   
  5. Income Taxes 
  Income tax expense was   $10 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $70 million   for the same period in   2015  . Income tax expense was   $160 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $164 million   for the same period in   2015  . The lower tax expense for the three-month period was primarily due to the sale of Empress on August 4, 2016 and the release of tax reserves. The nine-month periods include the   $74 million   tax impact of the loss on investment due to the impairment of goodwill at DCP Midstream in 2015, partially offset by tax rate changes in 2016.  
  The effective income tax rate was   3%   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   22%   for the same period in   2015  . The effective income tax rate was   16%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   20%   for the same period in   2015  . The lower effective income tax rate for the three-month period was primarily due to the sale of Empress on August 4, 2016 and the release of tax reserves. The nine-month periods include the   $74 million   tax impact of the loss on investment due to the impairment of goodwill at DCP Midstream in 2015, partially offset by tax rate changes in 2016.  
  There was an   $8 million   decrease in unrecognized tax benefits recorded during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . Although uncertain, we believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately   $20 million   to   $25 million   prior to   September 30,     2017   due to audit settlements and statute of limitations expirations.

6. Earnings per Common Share 
  Basic earnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income from controlling interests by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income from controlling interests by the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock, such as stock options, stock-based performance unit awards and phantom stock awards, were exercised, settled or converted into common stock. 
  The following table presents our basic and diluted EPS calculations:

8. Inventory 
  Inventory consists of natural gas held in storage for transmission and processing, and also includes materials and supplies. The NGLs previously included in inventory were disposed of as part of the Empress sale on August 4, 2016. See Note 2 for further discussion related to the sale of Empress. Natural gas inventories primarily relate to the Distribution segment in Canada and are valued at costs approved by the OEB. The difference between the approved price and the actual cost of gas purchased is recorded as either a receivable or a current liability, as appropriate, for future disposition with customers, subject to approval by the OEB. The remaining inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market, primarily using average cost. The components of inventory are as follows: 

9. Investments in and Loans to Unconsolidated Affiliates 
  Our most significant investment in unconsolidated affiliates is our   50%   investment in DCP Midstream, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The following represents summary financial information for DCP Midstream, presented at 100%: 

DCP Partners issues, from time to time, limited partner units to the public, which are recorded by DCP Midstream directly to its equity. Our proportionate share of gains from those issuances, totaled   $2 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and is reflected in Earnings (Loss) From Equity Investments in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
  During the third quarter of 2015, DCP Midstream finalized their goodwill impairment test. This resulted in the recognition of a   $460 million   goodwill impairment, which reduced our equity earnings from DCP Midstream by   $123 million   after-tax. 
  Related Party Transactions 
  During the third quarter of 2015, Gulfstream Natural Gas System, LLC (Gulfstream) issued unsecured debt of   $800 million   to fund the repayment of its current debt. Gulfstream distributed   $396 million  , our proportionate share of proceeds, to us of which we contributed   $248 million   back to Gulfstream in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the remaining   $148 million  , classified as Cash Flows from Investing Activities Distribution to Equity Investment, in the second quarter of 2016. 
   
  10. Variable Interest Entities 
  Sabal Trail.   On April 1, 2016, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra) purchased a   9.5%   interest in Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC (Sabal Trail) from SEP. Consideration for this transaction consisted of approximately   $110 million   cash,   $102 million   of which is classified as Cash Flows from Financing Activities Contributions from Noncontrolling Interests. See Note 11 for additional information related to this transaction. As of September 30, 2016, we have an effective   37.9%   ownership interest in Sabal Trail through our ownership of SEP. Sabal Trail is a joint venture that is constructing a natural gas pipeline to transport natural gas to Florida. Sabal Trail is a variable interest entity (VIE) due to insufficient equity at risk to finance its activities. We determined that we are the primary beneficiary because we direct the activities of Sabal Trail that most significantly impact its

     Table of Contents   

economic performance and we consolidate Sabal Trail in our financial statements. The current estimate of the total remaining construction cost is approximately   $1.5 billion  . 
  The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities for Sabal Trail: 

Nexus.   We have an effective   37.9%   ownership interest in Nexus Gas Transmission, LLC (Nexus) through our ownership of SEP. Nexus is a joint venture that is constructing a natural gas pipeline from Ohio to Michigan and continuing on to Ontario, Canada. Nexus is a VIE due to insufficient equity at risk to finance its activities. We determined that we are not the primary beneficiary because the power to direct the activities of Nexus that most significantly impact its economic performance is shared. Nexus is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our maximum exposure to loss is   $1.0 billion  . We have an investment in Nexus of   $281 million   and   $90 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, classified as Investments in and Loans to Unconsolidated Affiliates on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
   
  11. Intangible Asset 
  During the first quarter of 2016, SEP entered into a project coordination agreement (PCA) with NextEra, Duke Energy Corporation (Duke Energy) and Williams Partners L.P. In accordance with the agreement, payments will be made, based on SEP s proportional ownership interest in Sabal Trail, as certain milestones of the project are met. During the first quarter of 2016, the first milestone was achieved and paid, consisting of   $48 million  .  
  On April 1, 2016, NextEra purchased an additional   9.5%   interest in Sabal Trail from SEP, reducing SEP s ownership interest in Sabal Trail to   50%  . Upon purchase of the additional ownership interest, NextEra reimbursed SEP   $8 million   for NextEra s proportional share of the first milestone payment.  
  During the third quarter of 2016, the second milestone was achieved and paid, consisting of   $40 million  . The milestone payments are classified as Cash Flows from Investing Activities Purchase of Intangible, Net. This PCA, in the amount of   $80 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , is an intangible asset and is classified as Investments and Other Assets Other on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The intangible asset will be amortized over a period of   25   years beginning at the time of in-service of Sabal Trail, which is expected to occur during the first half of 2017. 
   
  12. Goodwill 
  We perform our goodwill impairment test annually and evaluate goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2016 and   no   impairments were identified. 
  We perform our annual review for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available, whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components and whether the economic and regulatory characteristics are similar. We determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our reportable segments, except for the reporting units of our Western Canada Transmission   Processing and Spectra Energy Partners reportable segments, which are one level below. 
  As permitted under accounting guidance on testing goodwill for impairment, we perform either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment of each of our reporting units based on management s judgment. With respect to our qualitative assessments, we consider events and circumstances specific to us, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents   

considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance, when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts. 
  See Note 9 for discussion related to the 2015 impairment of goodwill recognized by DCP Midstream. 
   
  13. Marketable Securities and Restricted Funds 
  We routinely invest excess cash and various restricted balances in securities such as commercial paper, bankers acceptances, corporate debt securities, Canadian equity securities, treasury bills and money market securities in the U.S. and Canada. We do not purchase marketable securities for speculative purposes; therefore we do not have any securities classified as trading securities. While we do not routinely sell marketable securities prior to their scheduled maturity dates, some of our investments may be held and restricted for insurance purposes, capital expenditures and NEB regulatory requirements, so these investments are classified as available-for-sale (AFS) marketable securities as they may occasionally be sold prior to their scheduled maturity dates due to the unexpected timing of cash needs. Initial investments in securities are classified as purchases of the respective type of securities (AFS marketable securities or held-to-maturity (HTM) marketable securities). Maturities of securities are classified within proceeds from sales and maturities of securities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  AFS Securities.   AFS Securities are as follows: 

___________________________________ 
           (a) 
    Amounts related to certain construction projects. 
              (b) 
    Amounts related to restricted funds held and collected from customers of Western Canada Transmission   Processing and Express-Platte for Canadian pipeline abandonment in accordance with the NEB s regulatory requirements. 
     Our AFS securities are classified on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average contractual maturity of outstanding AFS securities was less than   one year  . 
  There were   no   material gross unrealized holding gains or losses associated with investments in AFS securities at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

All of our HTM securities are restricted funds pursuant to certain M N Canada and Express-Platte (our crude oil pipeline system) debt agreements. The funds restricted for M N Canada, plus future cash from operations that would otherwise be available for distribution to the partners of M N Canada, are required to be placed in escrow until the balance in escrow is sufficient to fund all future debt service on the M N Canada   6.90%   senior secured notes. There are sufficient funds held in escrow to fund all future debt service on these M N Canada notes as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average contractual maturity of outstanding HTM securities was less than   one year  . 
  There were   no   material gross unrecognized holding gains or losses associated with investments in HTM securities at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  Other Restricted Funds  . In addition to the portions of the AFS and HTM securities that were restricted as described above, we had other restricted funds totaling   $25 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $11 million   at   December 31, 2015   classified as Current Assets Other on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Included in these restricted funds are   $13 million   at   September 30, 2016   of funds received from the province of Ontario related to the Green Investment Fund that is to be distributed to eligible homeowners, based on specific energy conservation initiatives at Union Gas and   $12 million   and   $11 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, related to additional amounts for insurance.  
  We also had other restricted funds totaling   $43 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $38 million   at   December 31, 2015   classified as Investments and Other Assets Other   on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  . Included in these restricted funds are   $17 million   and   $24 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, related to funds held and collected from customers of Western Canada Transmission   Processing and Express-Platte for Canadian pipeline abandonment in accordance with the NEB s regulatory requirements,   $7 million   and   $14 million  , respectively, related to   certain construction projects and   $19 million   at   September 30, 2016   of funds received from the province of Ontario related to the Green Investment Fund.

14. Debt and Credit Facilities 
  Available Credit Facilities and Restrictive Debt Covenants 

_________ 
           (a) 
    Revolving credit facilities contain a covenant requiring the Spectra Energy consolidated debt-to-total capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreements, to not exceed   65%  . Per the terms of the agreements, collateralized debt is excluded from the calculation of the ratio. This ratio was   55.8%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
              (b) 
    Revolving credit facility contains a covenant that requires SEP to maintain a ratio of total Consolidated Indebtedness-to-Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the agreement, of   5.0   to 1 or less. As of   September 30, 2016  , this ratio was   3.7   to 1. 
              (c) 
    U.S. dollar equivalent at   September 30, 2016  . The revolving credit facility is   400 million   Canadian dollars and contains a covenant that requires the Westcoast non-consolidated debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed   75%  . The ratio was   31.1%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
              (d) 
    U.S. dollar equivalent at   September 30, 2016  . The revolving credit facility is   700 million   Canadian dollars and contains a covenant that requires the Union Gas debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed   75%   and a provision which requires Union Gas to repay all borrowings under the facility for a period of two days during the second quarter of each year. The ratio was   68.1%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
     On September 29, 2016, we entered into a new one-year,   $2 billion   credit facility at Spectra Energy Capital, LLC (Spectra Capital), which expires in   2017  . Proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility must be repaid following any change in control, including any that results from the proposed merger with Enbridge. 
  On April 29, 2016, we amended the Union Gas and SEP revolving credit agreements. The Union Gas revolving credit facility was increased to   700 million   Canadian dollars and the SEP revolving facility was increased to   $2.5 billion  . The expiration of both facilities was extended, with both facilities expiring in   2021  . 
  On April 29, 2016, we amended the Westcoast and Spectra Capital revolving credit agreements. The expiration of both credit facilities was extended, with both facilities expiring in   2021  . 
  The issuances of commercial paper, letters of credit and revolving borrowings reduce the amount available under the credit facilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   letters of credit issued or revolving borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities. 
  Our credit agreements contain various covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with those covenants.   In addition, our credit agreements allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or in some cases, due to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. Our debt and credit agreements do not contain provisions that trigger an acceleration of indebtedness based solely on the occurrence of a material adverse change in our financial condition or results of operations. 
  Debt Issuances.   On May 31, 2016, Union Gas issued   250 million   Canadian dollars (approximately   $191 million   as of the issuance date) of   2.81%   unsecured notes due   2026   and   250 million   Canadian dollars (approximately   $191 million   as of the issuance date) of   3.80%   unsecured notes due   2046  . Net proceeds from the offerings were used for repayment of short term debt and debt maturities, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. 
  
   19

15. Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries 
  On August 30, 2016, Westcoast issued   12 million   Cumulative 5-Year Minimum Rate Reset Redeemable First Preferred Shares, Series 12 for an aggregate principal amount of   300 million   Canadian dollars (approximately   $229 million   as of the issuance date). Net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.

The following presents changes in Level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs: 

Level 1 
  Level 1 valuations represent quoted unadjusted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
  
   20 

     Table of Contents   

Level 2 Valuation Techniques 
  Fair values of our financial instruments that are actively traded in the secondary market, including our long-term debt, are determined based on market-based prices. These valuations may include inputs such as quoted market prices of the exact or similar instruments, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources that may include models or matrix pricing tools, with reasonable levels of price transparency. 
  For interest rate swaps, we utilize data obtained from a third-party source for the determination of fair value. Both the future cash flows for the fixed-leg and floating-leg of our swaps are discounted to present value. In addition, credit default swap rates are used to develop the adjustment for credit risk embedded in our positions. We believe that since some of the inputs and assumptions for the calculations of fair value are derived from observable market data, a Level 2 classification is appropriate. 
  Level 3 Valuation Techniques 
  Level 3 valuation techniques include the use of pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques where at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Level 3 financial instruments also include those for which the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there are   no   financial instruments classified as Level 3. Those reported in Level 3 at December 31, 2015 consisted of NGL revenue swap contracts related to the Empress assets in Western Canada Transmission   Processing, which were disposed of on August 4, 2016. See Note 2 for further discussion related to the sale of Empress. As of December 31, 2015, we reported certain of our NGL basis swaps at fair value using Level 3 inputs due to such derivatives not having observable market prices for substantially the full term of the derivative asset or liability. For valuations that included both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input was determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation was categorized in Level 3. This included derivatives valued using indicative price quotations whose contract length extended into unobservable periods. 
  The fair value of these NGL basis swaps was determined using a discounted cash flow valuation technique based on a forward commodity basis curve. For those derivatives, the primary input to the valuation model was the forward commodity basis curve, which was based on observable or public data sources and extrapolated when observable prices were not available.  
  Financial Instruments 
  The fair values of financial in  struments that are recorded and carried at book value are summarized in the following table. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. These estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we could have realized in current markets. 
   
        __________ 
           (a) 
    Included within Investments in and Loans to Unconsolidated Affiliates. 
              (b) 
    Excludes commercial paper, capital leases, unamortized items and fair value hedge carrying value adjustments. 
     The fair value of our long-term debt is determined based on market-based prices as described in the Level 2 valuation technique described above and is classified as Level 2. 
  The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, notes receivable noncurrent, accounts payable and commercial paper are not materially different from their carrying amounts because of the short-term nature of these instruments or because the stated rates approximate market rates. 
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , there were   no   material adjustments to assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

17. Risk Management and Hedging Activities  
  We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of NGLs and natural gas purchased as a result of our investment in DCP Midstream and processing operations associated with our U.S. pipeline assets. Exposure to interest rate risk exists as a result of the issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. We are exposed to foreign currency risk from our Canadian operations. We employ established policies and procedures to manage our risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include the use of derivatives, mostly around interest rate and commodity exposures. As of April 2016, we ceased entering into new contracts under our Empress risk management program. See Note 2 for further discussion related to the sale of Empress. 
  DCP Midstream manages their direct exposure to market prices separate from Spectra Energy, and utilizes various risk management strategies, including the use of commodity derivatives. 
  Other than the interest rate swaps and commodity derivatives as described below, we did not have significant derivatives outstanding during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Interest Rate Swaps 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had  pay floating receive fixed  interest rate swaps outstanding with a total notional amount of   $2 billion   to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt that arise as a result of changes in market interest rates. These swaps also allow us to transform a portion of the underlying interest payments related to our long-term fixed-rate debt securities into variable-rate interest payments in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable-rate debt. 
  Information about our interest rate swaps that had netting or rights of offset arrangements is as follows:

Commodity Derivatives

Information regarding the impacts of commodity derivatives on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations is as follows: 

18. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Environmental 
  We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as Canadian federal and provincial laws, regarding air and water quality, climate change, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters. These laws and regulations can change from time to time, imposing new obligations on us. 
  
   22 

     Table of Contents   

Like others in the energy industry, we and our affiliates are responsible for environmental remediation at various contaminated sites. These include some properties that are part of our ongoing operations, sites formerly owned or used by us, and sites owned by third parties. Remediation typically involves management of contaminated soils and may involve groundwater remediation. Managed in conjunction with relevant federal, state/provincial and local agencies, activities vary with site conditions and locations, remedial requirements, complexity and sharing of responsibility. If remediation activities involve statutory joint and several liability provisions, strict liability, or cost recovery or contribution actions, we or our affiliates could potentially be held responsible for contamination caused by other parties. In some instances, we may share liability associated with contamination with other potentially responsible parties, and may also benefit from contractual indemnities that cover some or all cleanup costs. All of these sites generally are managed in the normal course of business or affiliated operations. 
  Litigation 
  Litigation and Legal Proceedings.   We are involved in legal, tax and regulatory proceedings in various forums arising in the ordinary course of business, including matters regarding contract and payment claims, some of which involve substantial monetary amounts. We have insurance coverage for certain of these losses should they be incurred. We believe that the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
  Legal costs related to the defense of loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. We had   no   material reserves for legal matters recorded as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015   related to litigation. 
  Other Commitments and Contingencies 
  See Note 19 for a discussion of guarantees and indemnifications. 
   
  19. Guarantees and Indemnifications 
  We have various financial guarantees and indemnifications which are issued in the normal course of business. As discussed below, these contracts include financial guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. We enter into these arrangements to facilitate a commercial transaction with a third party by enhancing the value of the transaction to the third party. To varying degrees, these guarantees involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of having to perform under these guarantees and indemnifications is largely dependent upon future operations of various subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events. 
  We have issued performance guarantees to customers and other third parties that guarantee the payment and performance of other parties, including certain non-100%-owned entities. In connection with our spin-off from Duke Energy in 2007, certain guarantees that were previously issued by us were assigned to, or replaced by, Duke Energy as guarantor in 2006. For any remaining guarantees of other Duke Energy obligations, Duke Energy has indemnified us against any losses incurred under these guarantee arrangements. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could have been required to make under these performance guarantees as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $406 million  , which has been indemnified by Duke Energy as discussed above. One of these outstanding performance guarantees, which has a maximum potential amount of future payment of   $201 million  , expires in   2028  . The remaining guarantees have no contractual expirations. 
  We have also issued joint and several guarantees to some of the Duke/Fluor Daniel (D/FD) project owners, guaranteeing the performance of D/FD under its engineering, procurement and construction contracts and other contractual commitments in place at the time of our spin-off from Duke Energy. D/FD is one of the entities transferred to Duke Energy in connection with our spin-off. Substantially all of these guarantees have no contractual expiration and no stated maximum amount of future payments that we could be required to make. Fluor Enterprises Inc., as   50%   owner in D/FD, issued similar joint and several guarantees to the same D/FD project owners. 
  Westcoast, a   100%  -owned subsidiary, has issued performance guarantees to third parties guaranteeing the performance of unconsolidated entities, such as equity method investments, and of entities previously sold by Westcoast to third parties. Those guarantees require Westcoast to make payment to the guaranteed third party upon the failure of such unconsolidated or sold entity to make payment under some of its contractual obligations, such as debt agreements, purchase contracts and leases. 
  We have entered into various indemnification agreements related to purchase and sale agreements and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties. These agreements typically cover environmental, litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of representations, warranties and covenants. Typically, claims may be made by third parties for various periods of time, depending on the nature of the claim. Our potential exposure under these indemnification  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents   

agreements can range from a specified amount, such as the purchase price, to an unlimited dollar amount, depending on the nature of the claim and the particular transaction. We are unable to estimate the total potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to several factors, such as the unlimited exposure under certain guarantees. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the amounts recorded for the guarantees and indemnifications described above are not material, both individually and in the aggregate. 
   
  20. Issuances of Common Stock 
  On March 1, 2016, we entered into an equity distribution agreement under which we may sell and issue common stock up to an aggregate offering price of   $500 million  . The equity distribution agreement allows us to offer and sell common stock at prices deemed appropriate through sales agents. Sales of common stock under the equity distribution agreement will be made by means of ordinary brokers  transactions through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed upon by one or more of the sales agents and us. We intend to use the net proceeds from sales under this at-the-market program for general corporate purposes, including investments in subsidiaries to fund capital expenditures. We issued approximately   12.9 million   of common shares to the public under this program, for total net proceeds of   $383 million   through   September 30, 2016  . 
  In April 2016, we issued   16.1 million   common shares to the public for net proceeds of approximately   $479 million  . Net proceeds from the offering were used to purchase approximately   10.4 million   common units in SEP. SEP used the proceeds from our unit purchase for general corporate purposes, including the funding of its current expansion capital plan. 
   
  21. Issuances of SEP Units 
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , SEP issued   10.4 million   common units to the public under its at-the-market program and approximately   212,000   general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds to SEP were   $483 million   (net proceeds to Spectra Energy were   $473 million  ). 
  In April 2016, SEP issued   10.4 million   common units and   0.2 million   general partner units to Spectra Energy in a private placement transaction. See Note 20 for further discussion. 
  In connection with the issuances of the units, a   $40 million   gain (  $25 million   net of tax) to Additional Paid-in Capital and a   $432 million   increase in Equity Noncontrolling Interests were recorded during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . The issuances decreased Spectra Energy s ownership in SEP from   78%   to   76%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table presents the effects of the issuances of SEP units: 

22. Employee Benefit Plans 
  Retirement Plans.   We have a qualified non-contributory defined benefit (DB) retirement plan for U.S. employees and non-qualified, non-contributory, unfunded defined benefit plans which cover certain current and former U.S. executives. Our Westcoast subsidiary maintains qualified and non-qualified, contributory and non-contributory, DB and defined contribution (DC) retirement plans covering substantially all employees of our Canadian operations. 
  Our policy is to fund our retirement plans, where applicable, on an actuarial basis to provide assets sufficient to meet benefits to be paid to plan participants or as required by legislation or plan terms. We made contributions of   $16 million   to our U.S. retirement plans in both of the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . We made total contributions to the Canadian DC and DB plans of   $20 million   in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   $23 million   in the same period in   2015  . We anticipate that we will make total contributions of approximately   $22 million   to the U.S. plans and approximately   $26 million   to the Canadian plans in   2016  .

  Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost    

Retirement/Savings Plan.   In addition to the retirement plans described above, we also have defined contribution employee savings plans available to both U.S. and Canadian employees. Employees may participate in a matching contribution where we match a certain percentage of before-tax employee contributions of up to   6%   of eligible pay per pay period for U.S. employees and up to   5%   of eligible pay per pay period for Canadian employees. We expensed pre-tax employer matching contributions of   $4 million   in both of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $11 million   in both of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for U.S. employees. We expensed pre-tax employer matching contributions of   $3 million   and   $2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $9 million   and   $8 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for Canadian employees.

24. New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10,    Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810  ,   Consolidation  ,      which amends the consolidation guidance around reporting entities that invest in development stage entities. We adopted the consolidation guidance of this amendment on January 1, 2016 and applied it retrospectively with no material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. This ASU did result in certain of our entities being classified as Variable Interest Entities. See Note 10 for discussion of our Variable Interest Entities. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,    Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  ,      which makes changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model. These changes required reevaluation of certain entities for consolidation and required us to revise our documentation regarding the consolidation or deconsolidation of such entities. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016 with no material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,    Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  ,      to simplify accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination and to eliminate the retrospective accounting for those adjustments. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard has not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,    Leases (Topic 842)  ,      to improve the financial reporting around leasing transactions. The new guidance requires companies to begin recording assets and liabilities arising from those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. Furthermore, the new guidance will require significant additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows from leases. Topic 842 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in previous guidance. The result of retaining a distinction between finance leases and operating leases is that under the lessee accounting model in Topic 842, the effect of leases in the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of cash flows is largely unchanged from previous guidance. This ASU is effective for us January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05,    Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships  ,      which clarifies the hedge accounting impact when there is a change in one of the counterparties to the derivative contract (i.e. novation). This ASU is effective for us January 1, 2017. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06,    Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments  ,      which simplifies the embedded derivative analysis for debt instruments containing contingent call or put options. This ASU is effective for us January 1, 2017. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,    Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  ,      which eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. This ASU is effective for us January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  ,      to clarify implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. This ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,    Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ,      which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions. This ASU is effective for us January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us. 
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ,      to clarify implementation guidance on performance obligations and licensing. This ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us.

     Table of Contents   

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ,      to clarify implementation guidance on assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. This ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,    Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ,      to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires the consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ,      to provide guidance on specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. This ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us. 
   
  25. Subsequent Events 
  On October 17, 2016, SEP issued   $800 million   aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, comprised of   $600 million   of   3.375%   senior notes due   2026   and   $200 million   of   4.5%   senior notes due   2045  . The new   2045   notes are an additional issuance of SEP s   4.5%   senior notes issued in March 2015. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of outstanding commercial paper, to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. 
   
                 Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

INTRODUCTION 
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Executive Overview 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we reported net income from controlling interests of   $195 million   and   $174 million  , respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we reported net income from controlling interests of   $578 million   and   $459 million  , respectively. 
  The highlights for the three months and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   include the following: 
             
    Spectra Energy Partners  earnings for the three-month period benefited mainly from expansion projects, more than offset by pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania and the absence of equity earnings from DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (Sand Hills) and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC (Southern Hills) NGL pipelines, which SEP owned until October 2015.     For the nine-month period, earnings benefited mainly from expansion projects, more than offset by pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania, lower interruptible and short-term firm transportation revenue, a one-time property tax accrual adjustment in 2015 and by the absence of equity earnings from Sand Hills and Southern Hills. 
                
    Distribution s earnings for the three-month period benefited mainly from incremental earnings from the 2015 Dawn-Parkway expansion project and higher storage margins. For the nine-month period, earnings decreased mainly due to warmer weather and the effect of a lower Canadian dollar, partially offset by incremental earnings from the 2015 Dawn-Parkway expansion project and higher storage margins. 
                
    Western Canada Transmission   Processing s earnings for the three-month period decreased mainly due to lower firm gathering and processing revenues. For the nine-month period, earnings decreased mainly due to the effect of a lower Canadian dollar and lower firm gathering and processing revenues, partially offset by lower plant turnaround costs. 
                
    Field Services  earnings for the three-month period increased mainly due to higher gathering and processing margins, favorable contract realignment efforts and continued costs savings initiatives. For the nine-month period, earnings increased mainly due to the 2015 impairment of goodwill at DCP Midstream and an increase in gathering and processing margins, partially offset by lower commodity prices.

We are conducting an assessment of the Texas Eastern natural gas transmission system across Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The assessment is the result of a corrective action order from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), as well as our own work plan, related to an incident on the system on April 29, 2016 near Delmont, Pennsylvania. This assessment program and the related system repairs are expected to cost approximately $75 million to $100 million. Most of this program will be completed in 2016, with the remainder of the work to be performed in 2017. Additional inspections and repairs, if any, will be determined after the completion of this work. Importantly, as of November 1, 2016, we were in the position to fully meet our customer obligations. 
  In the first nine months of   2016  , we had $2.6 billion of capital and investment expenditures. We currently project $4.5 billion of capital and investment expenditures for the full year, including expansion capital expenditures of $3.9 billion. These projections exclude contributions from noncontrolling interests. 
  We are committed to an investment-grade balance sheet and continued prudent financial management of our capital structure. Therefore, financing growth activities will continue to be based on our strong and growing fee-based earnings and cash flows as well as the issuances of debt and equity securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , our revolving credit facilities included Spectra Capital s two facilities totaling $3 billion, SEP s $2.5 billion facility, Westcoast s 400 million Canadian dollar facility and Union Gas  700 million Canadian dollar facility. These facilities are used principally as back-stops for commercial paper programs. 
  On September 6, 2016, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Enbridge under which Enbridge and Spectra Energy will combine in a stock-for-stock merger transaction, which values Spectra Energy s stock at approximately $28 billion, based on the closing price of Enbridge s common shares as of September 2, 2016. This transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Spectra Energy and Enbridge and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to shareholder and certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. 
  Upon completion of the proposed merger, Spectra Energy shareholders will receive 0.984 Enbridge common shares for each share of Spectra Energy stock they own. The consideration to be received by Spectra Energy shareholders is valued at $40.33 per Spectra Energy share, based on the closing price of Enbridge common shares as of September 2, 2016, representing an approximate 11.5% premium to the closing price of Spectra Energy stock as of September 2, 2016. Upon completion of the merger, Enbridge shareholders are expected to own approximately 57% of the combined company and Spectra Energy shareholders are expected to own approximately 43%. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Same Period in 2015 
  Operating Revenues.   The   $28 million     decrease   was driven by: 
             
    lower firm gathering and processing revenues, the sale of Empress in August 2016 and non-cash mark-to-market commodity-related pricing adjustments associated with the risk management program at Empress at Western Canada Transmission   Processing, partially offset by 
                
    higher revenues from expansion projects at Spectra Energy Partners. 
     
   35 

     Table of Contents   

Operating Expenses.   The   $40 million     increase   was driven by: 
             
    pipeline inspection and repair costs, higher costs related to expansion and higher property tax accruals due to the absence of a 2015 tax benefit at Spectra Energy Partners, partially offset by 
                
    the sale of Empress at Western Canada Transmission   Processing. 
     Other Income and Expenses  . The   $24 million     increase   was mainly attributable to higher equity earnings from Field Services mainly due to higher gathering and processing margins as a result of asset growth and favorable contract realignment at DCP Midstream. 
  Interest Expense.   The   $22 million     decrease   was mainly due to the reversal of an interest accrual related to the release of tax reserves. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The   $60 million     decrease   was primarily attributable to the sale of Empress and the release of tax reserves. 
  The effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was 3% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 22% for the same period in   2015  . 
  Net Income Noncontrolling Interests  . The   $17 million     increase   was driven primarily by higher noncontrolling ownership interests at Spectra Energy Partners, partially offset by lower earnings at Spectra Energy Partners. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Same Period in 2015 
  Operating Revenues.   The   $300 million     decrease   was driven by: 
             
    lower usage due to warmer weather and lower natural gas prices passed through to customers, partially offset by growth in the number of customers, incremental earnings from the 2015 Dawn-Parkway expansion project and higher storage margins at Distribution, 
                
    the effects of a lower Canadian dollar at Distribution and Western Canada Transmission   Processing and 
                
    a decrease from non-cash mark-to-market commodity-related pricing adjustments associated with the risk management program at Empress, lower firm gathering and processing revenues, lower NGL prices at Empress and the sale of Empress at Western Canada Transmission   Processing, partially offset by 
                
    higher revenues from expansion projects at Spectra Energy Partners. 
     Operating Expenses.   The   $150 million     decrease   was driven by: 
             
    lower volumes of natural gas sold due to warmer weather and lower natural gas prices passed through to customers at Distribution, 
                
    lower costs of sales at Empress, lower plant turnaround costs and the sale of Empress at Western Canada Transmission   Processing and 
                
    the effects of a lower Canadian dollar at Distribution and Western Canada Transmission   Processing, partially offset by 
                
    pipeline inspection and repair costs, higher costs related to expansion and property tax accruals due to the absence of a 2015 tax benefit at Spectra Energy Partners. 
     Other Income and Expenses  . The   $267 million     increase   was mainly attributable to higher equity earnings from Field Services mainly due to the 2015 impairment of goodwill at DCP Midstream. 
  Interest Expense.   The   $43 million     decrease   was mainly due to higher capitalized interest, the reversal of an interest accrual, related to the release of tax reserves, and a lower Canadian dollar, partially offset by higher average debt balances. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The   $4 million     decrease   was primarily attributable to the sale of Empress, tax rate changes and the release of tax reserves, mostly offset by the tax impact of the impairment of goodwill at DCP Midstream in 2015. 
  The effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was 16% for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 20% for the same period in   2015  .

     Table of Contents   

Net Income Noncontrolling Interests  . The   $45 million     increase   was driven primarily by higher noncontrolling ownership interests at Spectra Energy Partners, partially offset by lower earnings at Spectra Energy Partners. 
  For a more detailed discussion of earnings drivers, see the segment discussions that follow. 
  Segment Results 
  Management evaluates segment performance based on EBITDA. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed at the parent-company levels, so the gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and interest and dividend income are excluded from the segments  EBITDA. We consider segment EBITDA to be a good indicator of each segment s operating performance from its operations, as it represents the results of our operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures. Our segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.  
  Segment EBITDA is summarized in the following table. Detailed discussions follow.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Same Period in 2015 
  Operating Revenues.   The   $16 million     increase   was driven by: 
             
    a $25 million increase due to expansion primarily on Texas Eastern and 
                
    a $3 million increase in storage revenues due to new contracts at higher rates, partially offset by 
                
    a $5 million decrease in processing revenues primarily due to lower volumes, net of higher prices, 
                
    a $4 million decrease in crude oil transportation revenues, as a result of lower Platte pipeline volumes, net of increased tariff rates mainly on the Express pipeline and 
                
    a $2 million decrease in recoveries of electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers. 
     Operating, Maintenance and Other.   The   $44 million     increase   was driven by: 
             
    a $38 million increase due to pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania,

    an $11 million decrease in recoveries of electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, 
                
    a $9 million decrease in processing revenues primarily due to lower volumes and prices and 
                
    an $8 million decrease in crude oil transportation revenues, as a result of lower volumes on the Platte and Express pipelines, substantially offset by increased tariff rates mainly on the Express pipeline. 
     Operating, Maintenance and Other.   The   $66 million     increase   was driven by: 
             
    a $44 million increase due to pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania, 
                
    a $39 million increase in costs related to expansion,

  Impairment of Goodwill 
  As permitted under accounting guidance on testing goodwill for impairment, we perform either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment of each of our reporting units based on management s judgment. With respect to our qualitative assessments, we consider events and circumstances specific to us, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance, when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts. 
  In connection with our quantitative assessments, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair values of those reporting units. Key assumptions in the determination of fair value include the use of an appropriate discount rate and estimated future cash flows. In estimating cash flows, we incorporate expected long-term growth rates in key markets served by our operations, regulatory stability, the ability to renew contracts, commodity prices (where appropriate) and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as other factors that affect our reporting units  revenue, expense and capital expenditure projections. 
  We performed either a quantitative assessment or a qualitative assessment for all of our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the respective fair values of these reporting units are less than their carrying amounts, including goodwill, as of April 1, 2016 (our annual testing date). Based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing, no indicators of impairment were noted and the fair values of the reporting units that we assessed at April 1, 2016 were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values. 
  No triggering events have occurred with our reporting units since the April 1, 2016 test that would warrant re-testing for goodwill impairment. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had negative working capital of   $1,937 million  . This balance includes commercial paper liabilities totaling   $1,637 million   and current maturities of long-term debt of   $467 million  . We will rely upon cash flows from operations and various financing transactions, which may include debt and/or equity issuances, to fund our liquidity and capital requirements for the next 12 months. SEP is expected to be self-funding through its cash flows from operations, use of its revolving credit facility and its access to capital markets. We receive cash distributions from SEP in accordance with the partnership agreement, which considers our level of ownership and incentive distribution rights. 
  On September 29, 2016, we entered into a new one-year,   $2 billion   credit facility at Spectra Capital, which expires in 2017. With this new credit facility, as of   September 30, 2016  , we have access to five revolving credit facilities, including Spectra Capital s two facilities totaling $3.0 billion, SEP s $2.5 billion facility, Westcoast s 400 million Canadian dollar facility and Union Gas  700 million Canadian dollar facility, with available capacity of   $1.3 billion   under SEP s credit facility and   $3.4 billion   under our other subsidiaries  credit facilities. These facilities are used principally as back-stops for commercial paper programs. At Spectra Capital, SEP and Westcoast, we primarily use commercial paper for temporary funding of capital expenditures. At Union Gas, we primarily use commercial paper for temporary funding of capital expenditures and to support short-term working capital fluctuations. We also utilize commercial paper, other variable-rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable-rate debt. See Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of available credit facilities and Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity for a discussion of effective shelf registrations.

Cash Flow Analysis 
  The following table summarizes the changes in cash flows for each of the periods presented: 

Operating Cash Flows 
  Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $  224 million   to   $1,599 million   in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , driven mostly by changes in working capital. 
  Investing Cash Flows 
  Net cash used in investing activities increased   $1,092 million   to   $2,595 million   in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . This change was driven mostly by: 
     a   $680 million   net increase in capital and investment expenditures, 
     a   $396 million   distribution received from Gulfstream with proceeds from a Gulfstream debt offering in 2015 and 
     a   $148 million   contribution to Gulfstream used to retire debt in 2016, partially offset by 
     $204 million   in proceeds related to the sale of Empress in 2016. 

Capital and investment expenditures for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   consisted of $2,171 million for expansion projects and $417 million for maintenance. 
  We project   2016   capital and investment expenditures of approximately $4.5 billion, consisting of approximately $2.5 billion for SEP, $0.9 billion for Distribution, $0.6 billion for Western Canada Transmission   Processing and $0.5 for Other. Total projected   2016   capital and investment expenditures include approximately $3.9 billion of expansion capital expenditures and $0.6 billion for maintenance and upgrades of existing plants, pipelines and infrastructure to serve growth. These projections exclude contributions from noncontrolling interests.

Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity 
  Net cash provided by financing activities totaled   $1,244 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $191 million   used in the same period in   2015  . This change was mainly driven mostly by: 
     $  878 million   in proceeds from the issuance of Spectra Energy's common stock in 2016 and 
     $229 million   in proceeds from the issuance of Westcoast's preferred stock in 2016. 
  Spectra Energy Common Stock Issuances.   On March 1, 2016, we entered into an equity distribution agreement under which we may sell and issue common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $500 million. The equity distribution agreement allows us to offer and sell common stock at prices deemed appropriate through sales agents. Sales of common stock under the equity distribution agreement will be made by means of ordinary brokers  transactions through the facilities of the NYSE, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed upon by one or more of the sales agents and us. We intend to use the net proceeds from sales under this at-the-market program for general corporate purposes, including investments in subsidiaries to fund capital expenditures. We issued approximately   12.9 million   of common shares to the public under this program, for total net proceeds of   $383 million   through   September 30, 2016  .  
  In April 2016, we issued 16.1 million common shares to the public for net proceeds of approximately $479 million. Net proceeds from the offering were used to purchase approximately 10.4 million common units in SEP. SEP used the proceeds from our unit purchase for general corporate purposes, including the funding of its current expansion capital plan. 
  SEP Common Unit Issuances.   During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , SEP issued   10.4 million   common units to the public under its at-the-market program and approximately   212,000   general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds to SEP were   $483 million   (net proceeds to Spectra Energy were   $473 million  ). In April 2016, SEP issued   10.4 million   common units and   0.2 million   general partner units to Spectra Energy in a private placement transaction. In connection with the issuances of the units, a   $40 million   gain (  $25 million   net of tax) to Additional Paid-in Capital and a   $432 million   increase in Equity Noncontrolling Interests were recorded during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . The issuances decreased Spectra Energy s ownership in SEP from   78%   to   76%   at   September 30, 2016  . In 2016, SEP has issued 10.9 million common units to the public and approximately 222,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy, for total net proceeds to SEP of $503 million (net proceeds to Spectra Energy were $493 million) through its at-the-market program. 
  Westcoast Preferred Stock Issuance.     On August 30, 2016, Westcoast issued 12 million Cumulative 5-Year Minimum Rate Reset Redeemable First Preferred Shares, Series 12 for an aggregate principle amount of 300 million Canadian dollars (approximately $229 million as of the issuance date). Net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. 
  Available Credit Facilities and Restrictive Debt Covenants.   See Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of available credit facilities and related financial and other covenants. 
  On September 29, 2016, we entered into a new one-year,   $2 billion   credit facility at Spectra Capital, which expires in   2017  . Proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility must be repaid following any change in control, including any that results from the proposed merger with Enbridge. 
  On April 29, 2016, we amended the Union Gas and SEP revolving credit agreements. The Union Gas revolving credit facility was increased to   700 million   Canadian dollars and the SEP revolving facility was increased to   $2.5 billion  . The expiration of both facilities was extended, with both facilities expiring in   2021  . 
  On April 29, 2016, we amended the Westcoast and Spectra Capital revolving credit agreements. The expiration of both credit facilities was extended, with both facilities expiring in   2021  . 
  The terms of our Spectra Capital credit agreements and term loans require our consolidated debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreements, to be 65% or lower. Per the terms of the agreements, collateralized debt is excluded from the calculation of the ratio. This ratio was   55.8%   at   September 30, 2016  . Our equity and, as a result, this ratio, is sensitive to significant movements of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar due to the significance of our Canadian operations. Based on the strength of our total capitalization as of   September 30, 2016  , however, it is not likely that a material adverse effect would occur as a result of a lower Canadian dollar. 
  Dividends.   Our near-term objective is to increase our cash dividend by $0.14 per share, per year, through 2018. We expect to continue our policy of paying regular cash dividends. The declaration and payment of dividends are subject to the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the financial condition, earnings and  
  
   45 

     Table of Contents   

capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.405 per common share on October 19, 2016 payable on December 6, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 11, 2016. 
  Debt Issuances.   On October 17, 2016, SEP issued   $800 million   aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, comprised of   $600 million   of   3.375%   senior notes due   2026   and   $200 million   of   4.5%   senior notes due   2045  . The new   2045   notes are an additional issuance of SEP s   4.5%   senior notes issued in March 2015. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of outstanding commercial paper, to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. 
  On May 31, 2016, Union Gas issued 250 million Canadian dollars (approximately $191 million as of the issuance date) of 2.81% unsecured notes due 2026 and 250 million Canadian dollars (approximately $191 million as of the issuance date) of 3.80% unsecured notes due 2046. Net proceeds from the offerings were used for repayment of short term debt and debt maturities, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. 
  Other Financing Matters  . Spectra Energy Corp, Spectra Capital and SEP have effective shelf registration statements on file with the SEC to register the issuance of unlimited amounts of various equity and debt securities. SEP also has $466 million available as of   September 30, 2016   for the issuance of limited partner common units under another effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC related to its at-the-market program. Westcoast and Union Gas have an aggregate 1.2 billion Canadian dollars (approximately $914 million) available as of   September 30, 2016   for the issuance of debt securities in the Canadian market under their medium term note shelf prospectuses. 
  On March 18, 2016, Westcoast filed a new 1 billion Canadian dollar short form base shelf prospectus, which provides for the issuance of first preferred shares. As of the date of this filing, Westcoast has 700 million Canadian dollars (approximately $533 million) available for the issuance of preferred shares under this prospectus, which expires on April 18, 2018.

The complaints allege, among other things, that Spectra Energy and its board of directors breached their fiduciary duties (in the Delaware lawsuit) and violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder (in the Southern District of Texas lawsuits), as applicable, by issuing or causing to be issued an allegedly materially misleading and incomplete preliminary proxy statement in connection with the proposed merger.  Enbridge and its subsidiary are also named as defendants in the Delaware lawsuit, and the Delaware complaint alleges, among other things, that Enbridge and its subsidiary aided and abetted Spectra Energy s board of directors  alleged breach of fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs seek as relief, among other things, an injunction against the merger, rescission of the merger to the extent it is already implemented, declaratory relief, costs and attorneys  fees, and/or damages. We believe the actions are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them.
