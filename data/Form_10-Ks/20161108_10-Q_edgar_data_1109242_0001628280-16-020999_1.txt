  Note 1   Organization and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Hanmi Financial Corporation ( Hanmi Financial,  the  Company,   we,   us  or  our ) is a bank holding company whose subsidiary is Hanmi Bank (the  Bank ). Our primary operations are related to traditional banking activities, including the acceptance of deposits and the lending and investing of money through operation of the Bank. Effective July 19, 2016, the Bank voluntarily withdrew from the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve"). As a result, the Bank became a state non-member bank and will be regulated by the California Department of Business Oversight and the FDIC. During the third quarter in 2016, the Federal Reserve canceled the Bank's holdings of Federal Reserve stock for   $14.4 million   in cash. 
    
  In management s opinion, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Hanmi Financial and its subsidiaries reflect all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim period ended   September 30, 2016  , but are not necessarily indicative of the results that will be reported for the entire year or any other interim period. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. The aforementioned unaudited consolidated financial statements are in conformity with GAAP. Such interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The interim information should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K ). 
    
  The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates subject to change include, among other items, the determination of allowance for loan losses and various other assets and liabilities measured at fair value.  
    
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Descriptions of our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1   -   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Note 2   Securities 
    
  The following is a summary of securities available for sale as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :    

(1)   
    Collateralized by residential mortgages and guaranteed by U.S. government sponsored entities. 

9 

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities as of   September 30, 2016  , by contractual or expected maturity, are shown below. Collateralized mortgage obligations are included in the table shown below based on their expected maturities. Mutual funds do not have contractual maturities. However, they are included in the table shown below as over ten years since the Company intends to hold these securities for at least this duration. All other securities are included based on their contractual maturities. 

Gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale, the estimated fair value of the related securities and the number of securities aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, were as follows as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

All individual securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for   12 months   or longer as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   had investment grade ratings upon purchase. The issuers of these securities have not established any cause for default on these securities and the various rating agencies have reaffirmed these securities  long-term investment grade status as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . These securities have fluctuated in value since their purchase dates as market interest rates have fluctuated. 

10 

The Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis. In addition, the unrealized losses on municipal and corporate bonds are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired, as the bonds are rated investment grade and there are no credit quality concerns with the issuers. Interest payments have been made as scheduled, and management believes this will continue in the future and that the bonds will be repaid in full as scheduled. Therefore, in management s opinion, all securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for the past   12   months or longer as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were not other-than-temporarily impaired, and therefore,   no   impairment charges as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were warranted. 
    
  Realized gains and losses on sales of securities and proceeds from sales of securities were as follows for the periods indicated: 

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was a   $46,000   net gain in earnings resulting from the sale of securities that had previously been recorded as net unrealized gains of   $321,000   in comprehensive income. For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , there was a   $2.0 million   net gain in earnings resulting from the sale of securities that had previously been recorded as net unrealized gains of   $1.2 million   in comprehensive income.  
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was a   $46,000   net gain in earnings resulting from the sale of securities that had previously been recorded as net unrealized losses of   $314,000   in comprehensive income. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , there was a   $6.1 million   net gain in earnings resulting from the sale of securities that had previously been recorded as net unrealized gains of   $2.0 million   in comprehensive income. 
    
  Securities available for sale with market values of $  108.5 million   and $  72.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law.  

11 

Note 3   Loans 
    
  Loans Receivable, Net 
    
  Loans receivable consisted of the following as of the dates indicated: 

(2)   
    Includes, among other property types, mixed-use, apartment, office, industrial, faith-based facilities and warehouse; the remaining real estate categories represent less than one percent of the Bank's total loans. 
        
  Accrued interest on loans receivable was   $7.5 million   and   $7.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , loans receivable of   $1.0 billion   and   $557.7 million  , respectively, were pledged to secure borrowing facilities from the FHLB and the FRB's discount window.

Loans Held for Sale 
    
  The following table includes the activity for loans held for sale (excluding PCI loans) by portfolio segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The following table includes the activity for loans held for sale (excluding PCI loans) by portfolio segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

13 

Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  Activity in the allowance for loan losses was as follows for the periods indicated: 

Management believes the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. However, the allowance is an estimate that is inherently uncertain and depends on the outcome of future events. Management s estimates are based on previous loss experience; volume, growth and composition of the loan portfolio; the value of collateral; and current economic conditions. Our lending is concentrated generally in real estate, commercial, SBA and trade finance lending to small and middle market businesses primarily in California, Texas and Illinois. 
  
   14 

The following table details the information on the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment as of and for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

The following table details the information on the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment as of and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

16 

Loan Quality Indicators  
    
  As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of our loan portfolio, we utilize an internal loan grading system to identify credit risk and assign an appropriate grade, from   0   to   8  , for each loan in our loan portfolio. Third party loan reviews are performed throughout the year. Additional adjustments are made when determined to be necessary. The loan grade definitions are as follows:  
  Pass and Pass-Watch:   Pass and pass-watch loans, grades 0-4, are in compliance in all respects with the Bank s credit policy and regulatory requirements, and do not exhibit any potential or defined weaknesses as defined under Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful. This category is the strongest level of the Bank s loan grading system. It incorporates all performing loans with no credit weaknesses. It includes cash and stock/security secured loans or other investment grade loans. 
  Special Mention:   A special mention credit, grade 5, has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If not corrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects of the debt and result in a Substandard classification. Loans that have significant actual, not potential, weaknesses are considered more severely classified.  
  Substandard:   A substandard credit, grade 6, has a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt. A credit graded Substandard is not protected by the sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower, or of the value and type of collateral pledged. With a Substandard loan, there is a distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the weaknesses or deficiencies are not corrected.  
  Doubtful:   A doubtful credit, grade 7, is one that has critical weaknesses that would make the collection or liquidation of the full amount due improbable. However, there may be pending events which may work to strengthen the credit, and therefore the amount or timing of a possible loss cannot be determined at the current time.  
  Loss:   A loan classified as loss, grade 8, is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as an active bank asset is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be possible in the future. Loans classified as loss are charged off in a timely manner. 
    
  Under regulatory guidance, loans graded special mention or worse are considered criticized loans and loans graded substandard or worse are considered classified loans. 

17 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , pass/pass-watch, special mention and classified loans (excluding PCI loans), disaggregated by loan class, were as follows:  

18 

The following is an aging analysis of loans (excluding PCI loans), disaggregated by loan class, as of the dates indicated: 

There were no loans that were   90   days or more past due and accruing interest as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
    
  Impaired Loans 
    
  Loans are considered impaired when the Bank will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments per the contractual terms of the loan agreement, unless the loan is well-collateralized and in the process of collection; or they are classified as Troubled Debt Restructurings ( TDRs ) because, due to the financial difficulties of the borrowers, we have granted concessions to the borrowers we would not otherwise consider; or when current information or events make it unlikely to collect in full according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements; or there is a deterioration in the borrower s financial condition that raises uncertainty as to timely collection of either principal or interest; or full payment of both interest and principal is in doubt according to the original contractual terms.  
  We evaluate loan impairment in accordance with applicable GAAP. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, less estimated costs to sell. If the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the deficiency is either charged off against the allowance for loan losses or we establish a specific allocation in the allowance for loan losses. Additionally, loans that are  
  
   19 

considered impaired are specifically excluded from the quarterly migration analysis when determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses required for the period.  
  The allowance for collateral-dependent loans is determined by calculating the difference between the outstanding loan balance and the value of the collateral as determined by recent appraisals. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans varies from loan to loan based on the collateral coverage of the loan at the time of designation as nonperforming. We continue to monitor the collateral coverage, using recent appraisals, on these loans on a quarterly basis and adjust the allowance accordingly.  
    
  The following tables provide information on impaired loans (excluding PCI loans), disaggregated by loan class, as of the dates indicated: 

20 

The following is a summary of interest foregone on impaired loans (excluding PCI loans) for the periods indicated: 

There were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans are included in the table above. 

21 

Nonaccrual Loans and Nonperforming Assets 
    
  Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the opinion of management, the full timely collection of principal or interest is in doubt. Generally, the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest payments become more than   90 days   past due, unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection. However, in certain instances, we may place a particular loan on nonaccrual status earlier, depending upon the individual circumstances surrounding the loan s delinquency. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current income. Subsequent collections of cash are applied as principal reductions when received, except when the ultimate collectability of principal is probable, in which case interest payments are credited to income. Nonaccrual loans may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments become current and full repayment is expected.  
       
  The following table details nonaccrual loans (excluding PCI loans), disaggregated by loan class, as of the dates indicated: 

The following table details nonperforming assets (excluding PCI loans) as of the dates indicated: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , OREO consisted of   15   properties with a combined carrying value of   $11.0 million  . Of the   $11.0 million  ,   $5.8 million   were OREO acquired in the Central Bancorp Inc. ("CBI") acquisition on August 31, 2014, or were obtained as a result of PCI loan collateral foreclosures subsequent to the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2015, OREO consisted of   14   properties with a combined carrying value of   $8.5 million  , including   $7.4 million   OREO acquired in the CBI acquisition or obtained as a result of PCI loan collateral foreclosures subsequent to the acquisition date.  

22 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 
       
  The following table details TDRs (excluding PCI loans), disaggregated by concession type and loan type, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , total TDRs were   $14.9 million   and   $17.2 million  , respectively. A debt restructuring is considered a TDR if we grant a concession, that we would not have otherwise considered to the borrower, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties. Loans are considered to be TDRs if they were restructured through payment structure modifications such as reducing the amount of principal and interest due monthly and/or allowing for interest only monthly payments for   three months   or more. All TDRs are impaired and are individually evaluated for specific impairment using one of these three criteria: (1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate; (2) the loan s observable market price; or (3) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $595,000   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, of allowance relating to these loans were included in the allowance for loan losses. 

23 

The following table details TDRs (excluding PCI loans), disaggregated by loan class, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1)   
    Includes a modification of   $1.2 million   through a reduction of principal or accrued interest for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
         
  The following table details TDRs (excluding PCI loans), disaggregated by loan class, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1)   
    Includes a modification of   $23,000   through a reduction of principal or accrued interest for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and a modification of   $1.2 million   through a reduction of principal or accrued interest for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
          
  For the restructured loans on accrual status, we determined that, based on the financial capabilities of the borrowers at the time of the loan restructuring and the borrowers  past performance in the payment of debt service under the previous loan terms, performance and collection under the revised terms are probable. 

24 

The following table details TDRs (excluding PCI loans) that defaulted subsequent to the modifications occurring within the previous   12 months  , disaggregated by loan class, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

The following table details TDRs (excluding PCI loans) that defaulted subsequent to the modifications occurring within the previous    12 months  , disaggregated by loan class, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

Purchased Credit Impaired Loans 
    
  As part of the acquisition of CBI, the Company purchased loans for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality subsequent to origination and it was probable that all contractually required payments would not be collected. Outstanding balance of PCI loans, the undiscounted sum of all amounts including amounts deemed principal, interest, fees and penalties, were $  19.6 million   and   $30.9 million  , respectively as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015.  
  For PCI loans, at the time of acquisition we (i) calculated the contractual amount and timing of undiscounted principal and interest payments (the  undiscounted contractual cash flows ) and (ii) estimated the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal and interest payments (the  undiscounted expected cash flows ). The difference between the undiscounted contractual cash flows and the undiscounted expected cash flows is the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference represents an estimate of the loss exposure of principal and interest related to the PCI loan portfolios; such amount is subject to change over time based on the performance of such loans. The carrying value of PCI loans is reduced by payments received, both principal and interest, and increased by the portion of the accretable yield recognized as interest income. 
  The excess of expected cash flows at acquisition over the initial fair value of acquired impaired loans is referred to as the  accretable yield  and is recorded as interest income over the estimated life of the loans using the effective yield. If estimated cash flows are indeterminable, the recognition of interest income will cease. 
  At acquisition, the Company may aggregate PCI loans into pools having common credit risk characteristics such as product type, geographic location and risk rating. Increases in expected cash flows over those previously estimated increase the accretable yield and are recognized as interest income prospectively. Decreases in the amount and changes in the timing of expected cash flows compared to those previously estimated decrease the accretable yield and usually result in a provision for loan losses and the establishment of an allowance for loan losses. As the accretable yield increases or decreases from changes in cash flow expectations, the offset is a decrease or increase to the nonaccretable difference. The accretable yield is measured at each financial reporting date based on information then currently available and represents the difference between the remaining undiscounted expected cash flows and the current carrying value of the loans. 
  
   25 

The Company removes loans from loan pools when the Company receives payment in settlement with the borrower, sells the loan, or foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan. The Company recognizes "Disposition gain on Purchased Credit Impaired Loans" when the cash proceeds or the amount received are in excess of the loan's carrying amount. The removal of the loan from the loan pool and the recognition of disposition gains do not affect the then applicable loan pool accretable yield. 
  The following table summarizes the changes in carrying value of PCI loans during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015:   

26 

As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, pass/pass-watch, special mention and classified PCI loans, disaggregated by loan class, were as follows:   

Loans accounted for as PCI are generally considered accruing and performing loans as the accretable discount is accreted to interest income over the estimated life of the loan when cash flows are reasonably estimable. Accordingly, PCI loans that are contractually past due are still considered to be accruing and performing loans. If the timing and amount of future cash flows is not reasonably estimable, the loans are classified as nonaccrual loans and interest income is not recognized until the timing and amount of future cash flows can be reasonably estimated. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no PCI loans on nonaccrual status and included in the delinquency table below.

Note 4   Servicing Assets and Liabilities 
    
  The changes in servicing assets and liabilities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we serviced loans sold to unaffiliated parties in the amounts of   $485.1 million   and $  468.9 million  , respectively. These represented loans that have been sold for which the Bank continues to provide servicing. These loans are maintained off balance sheet and are not included in the loans receivable balance. All of the loans serviced were SBA loans. 
    
  The Company recorded servicing fee income of   $1.2 million   for each of the three-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Servicing fee income was   $3.6 million   and   $3.5 million   for   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Servicing fee income, net of amortization of servicing assets and liabilities, is included in other operating income in the consolidated statements of income. Net amortization expense was   $598,000   and   $1.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1.0 million   and   $2.7 million   for   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

Note 5   Income Taxes 
    
  The Company s income tax expense was   $8.2 million   and   $10.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The effective income tax rate was   38.6 percent   and   43.1 percent   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company s income tax expense was   $23.3 million   and   $27.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The effective income tax rates were   35.6 percent   and   41.6 percent   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Income tax expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   includes a   $1.8 million   tax benefit recorded as a result of finalization of the Company's 2014 amended income tax returns. Management concluded that   no   valuation allowance is required for the deferred tax assets as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   29 

The Company is subject to examination by various federal and state tax authorities for the years ended December 31, 2008 through 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was subjected to audit or examination by Internal Revenue Service for the 2013 and 2014 tax year and California Franchise Tax Board for the 2008 and 2009 tax years. Management does not anticipate any material changes in our financial statements as a result of the audits. 

Note 6   Debt 
    
  FHLB Borrowings 
    
  The Bank had   $55.0 million   and   $170.0 million   in advances (borrowings) from the FHLB as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The FHLB advances were all overnight borrowings at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest expense on FHLB advances was   $179,000   and   $1,000  , respectively, and the weighted-average interest rate was   0.47 percent   and   0.21 percent  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest expense on FHLB advances was   $673,000   and   $61,000  , respectively, and the weighted-average interest rate was   0.44 percent   and   0.18 percent  , respectively. 
    
  The Bank maintains a secured credit facility with the FHLB, allowing the Bank to borrow on an overnight and term basis. The Bank had   $1.0 billion   of loans pledged as collateral with the FHLB, which provides   $751.3 million   in borrowing capacity, of which   $696.3 million   remained available at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Bank also has   $11.3 million   of securities pledged with the FRB, which provides   $11.1 million   in available borrowing capacity through the Fed Discount Window. There were   no   outstanding borrowings with the FRB as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Subordinated Debentures 
  The Company assumed Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures ( Subordinated Debentures ) as a result of the acquisition of CBI with an unpaid principal balance of   $26.8 million   and an estimated fair value of   $18.5 million  . The   $8.3 million   discount is being amortized to interest expense through the debentures' maturity date of March 15, 2036. CBI formed a trust in 2005 and issued   $26.0 million   of Trust Preferred Securities ( TPS ) at   6.26 percent   fixed rate for the first   five years   and a variable rate at the   3 month LIBOR plus 140 basis   points thereafter and invested the proceeds in the Subordinated Debentures. The Company may redeem the Subordinated Debentures at an earlier date if certain conditions are met. The TPS will be subject to mandatory redemption if the Subordinated Debentures are repaid by the Company. Interest is payable   quarterly  , and the Company has the option to defer interest payments on the Subordinated Debentures from time to time for a period not to exceed   five   consecutive years. The amortization of discount was $  67,000   and   $46,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively, and   $185,000   and   $125,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively. 

Note 7   Earnings Per Share 
    
  Earnings per share ( EPS ) is calculated on both a basic and a diluted basis. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted from the issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings, excluding common shares in treasury.  
    
  For diluted EPS, weighted-average number of common shares included the impact of restricted stock under the treasury method. The Company amended all restricted stock agreements with time-based vesting criterion as of September 1, 2015 to allow for the payment of non-forfeitable dividends on unvested restricted stock, accordingly, we adopted the two-class method for EPS calculation pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 260-10,   Earnings Per Share  . Unvested restricted stock containing rights to non-forfeitable dividends are considered participating securities prior to vesting and have been included in the earnings allocation in computing basic and diluted EPS under the two-class method. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income, net of income allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares. For diluted EPS, weighted-average number of common shares include the diluted effect of stock options. 

30 

The following table is a reconciliation of the components used to derive basic and diluted EPS for the periods indicated: 

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , stock options of   12,034   and   29,000  , respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because their effect was anti-dilutive. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , stock options of   74,389   and   57,000  , respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because their effect was anti-dilutive.  

Note 8   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 
    
  Activity in accumulated other comprehensive income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows: 

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was   $46,000   reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to gains in earnings resulting from the sale of available-for-sale securities. The   $46,000   reclassification adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income was included in net gain on sales of securities under noninterest  
  
   31 

income. Net unrealized gains of   $321,000   related to these sold securities had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , there was a   $2.0 million   reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to gains in earnings resulting from the sale of available-for-sale securities. The   $2.0 million   reclassification adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income was included in net gain on sales of securities under noninterest income. Net unrealized gains of   $1.2 million   related to these sold securities had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
    
  Activity in accumulated other comprehensive income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows: 

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was a   $46,000   reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to gains in earnings resulting from the sale of available-for-sale securities. The   $46,000   reclassification adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income was included in net gain on sales of securities under noninterest income. Net unrealized losses of   $314,000   related to these sold securities had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , there was a   $6.1 million   reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to gains in earnings resulting from the sale of available-for-sale securities. The   $6.1 million   reclassification adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income was included in net gain on sales of securities under noninterest income. Net unrealized gains of   $2.0 million   related to these sold securities had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. 

Note 9   Regulatory Matters 
    
  Risk-Based Capital 
    
  In July 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC approved the Basel III regulatory capital framework and related changes under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The rules revise minimum capital requirements and adjust prompt corrective action thresholds. The rules also revise the regulatory capital elements, add a new common equity Tier I capital ratio, and increase the minimum Tier I capital ratio requirement. The revisions permit banking organizations to retain, through a one-time election, the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income. Basel III rules, including certain transitional provisions, became effective January 1, 2015, and its requirements are included in the capital ratios presented in the table shown below. 
  
   32 

In addition, a new capital conservation buffer of   2.5%   began to be phased in effective January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2019, and must be met to avoid limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. In January 2016, the new capital conservation buffer requirement was   0.625%   of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019.  
    
  The capital ratios of Hanmi Financial and the Bank as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

Note 10   Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Fair Value Measurements  
    
  ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  , defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value including a three-level valuation hierarchy, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The three-level fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of  
  
   33 

unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are defined as follows:  

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.  
                
    Level 2 - Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
                
    Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  
       
  Fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting. Additionally, fair value is used on a non-recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes.  
    
  We record securities available for sale at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain other assets, such as loans held for sale, impaired loans, OREO, and core deposit intangible, are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Non-recurring fair value measurements typically involve assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment and for which any impairment is recorded in the period in which the re-measurement is performed.  
    
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument below:  
    
  Securities available for sale - The fair values of securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities, or other model-based valuation techniques requiring observable inputs other than quoted prices such as yield curve, prepayment speeds, and default rates. Level 1 securities include U.S. treasury securities and mutual funds that are traded on an active exchange or by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets. The fair value of these securities is determined by quoted prices on an active exchange or over-the-counter market. Level 2 securities primarily include mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, U.S. government agency securities, SBA loan pool securities, municipal bonds and corporate bonds in markets that are active. In determining the fair value of the securities categorized as Level 2, we obtain reports from nationally recognized broker-dealers detailing the fair value of each investment security held as of each reporting date. The broker-dealers use prices obtained from nationally recognized pricing services to value our fixed income securities. The fair value of the municipal securities is determined based on pricing data provided by nationally recognized pricing services. We review the prices obtained for reasonableness based on our understanding of the marketplace, and also consider any credit issues related to the bonds. As we have not made any adjustments to the market quotes provided to us and as they are based on observable market data, they have been categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 securities are instruments that are not traded in the market. As such, no observable market data for the instrument is available, which necessitates the use of significant unobservable inputs. 
    
   Loans held for sale - Loans held for sale are all SBA loans and carried at the lower of cost or fair value. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $6.4 million   and   $2.9 million   SBA loans held for sale, respectively. Management obtains quotes, bids or pricing indication sheets on all or part of these loans directly from the purchasing financial institutions. Premiums received or to be received on the quotes, bids or pricing indication sheets are indicative of the fact that cost is lower than fair value. At   September 30, 2016  , the entire balance of SBA loans held for sale was recorded at its cost. We record SBA loans held for sale on a nonrecurring basis with Level 2 inputs.  
    
  Impaired loans (excluding PCI loans) - Nonaccrual loans and performing restructured loans are considered impaired for reporting purposes and are measured and recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Nonaccrual Non-PCI loans with an unpaid principal balance over   $100,000   and all performing restructured loans are reviewed individually for the amount of impairment, if any. Nonaccrual Non-PCI loans with an unpaid principal balance of    $100,000   or less are evaluated for impairment collectively. The Company does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, nonrecurring fair value adjustments to collateral dependent impaired loans are recorded based on either the current appraised value of the collateral, a Level 2 measurement, or management s judgment and estimation of value reported on older appraisals that are then adjusted based on recent market trends, a Level 3 measurement. 

34 

OREO - Fair value of OREO is based primarily on third party appraisals, less costs to sell and result in a Level 2 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Appraisals are required annually and may be updated more frequently as circumstances require and the fair value adjustments are made to OREO based on the updated appraised value of the property. 
    
  Nonperforming loans held for sale     - We reclassify certain nonperforming loans as held for sale when we decide to sell those loans. The fair value of nonperforming loans held for sale is generally based upon the quotes, bids or sales contract prices which approximate their fair value. Nonperforming loans held for sale are recorded at estimated fair value less anticipated liquidation cost. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have nonperforming loans held for sale, which are measured on a nonrecurring basis with Level 2 inputs.  
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows: 

35 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are as follows: 

(2)   
    Consist of properties obtained from the foreclosure of commercial property loans of   $8.3 million   and residential property loans of   $2.7 million  . 
               (3)   
    Consist of real estate loans of   $27.9 million  , commercial and industrial loans of   $1.0 million  , and consumer loans of   $1.7 million  . 
               (4)   
    Consist of properties obtained from the foreclosure of commercial property loans of   $6.6 million   and residential property loans of   $1.9 million  . 
       
  ASC 825,   Financial Instruments  , requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis are discussed above. 
    
  The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data in order to develop estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 

36 

The estimated fair values of financial instruments were as follows: 

37 

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it was practicable to estimate that value are explained below: 
  Cash and cash equivalents - The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments (Level 1).  
  Securities - The fair value of securities, consisting of securities available for sale, is generally obtained from market bids for similar or identical securities, from independent securities brokers or dealers, or from other model-based valuation techniques described above (Levels 1, 2 and 3).  
  Loans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses - Loans receivable include Non-PCI loans, PCI loans and Non-PCI impaired loans. The fair value of Non-PCI loans receivable is estimated based on the discounted cash flow approach. The discount rate was derived from the associated yield curve plus spreads and reflects the offering rates offered by the Bank for loans with similar financial characteristics. Yield curves are constructed by product type using the Bank s loan pricing model for like-quality credits. The discount rates used in the Bank s model represent the rates the Bank would offer to current borrowers for like-quality credits. These rates could be different from what other financial institutions could offer for these loans. No adjustments have been made for changes in credit within the loan portfolio. It is our opinion that the allowance for loan losses relating to performing and nonperforming loans results in a fair valuation of such loans. Additionally, the fair value of our loans may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such loans and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize (Level 3). 
  The fair value of PCI loans receivable was estimated based on discounted expected cash flows. Increases in expected cash flows and improvements in the timing of cash flows over those previously estimated increase the amount of accretable yield and are recognized as an increase in yield and interest income prospectively. Decreases in the amount and delays in the timing of expected cash flows compared to those previously estimated decrease the amount of accretable yield and usually result in a provision for loan losses and the establishment of an allowance for loan losses (Level 3). 
  The fair value of impaired loans (excluding PCI loans) is estimated based on the net realizable fair value of the collateral or the observable market price of the most recent sale or quoted price from loans held for sale.  The Company does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis.  Nonrecurring fair value adjustments to collateral dependent impaired loans are recorded based on the current appraised value of the collateral (Level 3). 
    
  Loans held for sale - Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair market value, as determined based upon quotes, bids or sales contract prices, or as may be assessed based upon the fair value of the collateral which is obtained from recent real estate appraisals (Level 2). Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustment is typically significant and results in Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.  
  Accrued interest receivable - The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value (Level 1). 
  FHLB and FRB stock - The carrying amounts of FHLB and FRB stock approximate fair value as such stock may be resold to the issuer at carrying value (Level 2).  
  Noninterest-bearing deposits - The fair value of noninterest-bearing deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (Level 2).  
  Interest-bearing deposits - The fair value of interest-bearing deposits, such as savings accounts, money market checking, and certificates of deposit, is estimated based on discounted cash flows. The cash flows for non-maturity deposits, including savings accounts and money market checking, are estimated based on their historical decaying experiences. The discount rate used for fair valuation is based on interest rates currently being offered by the Bank on comparable deposits as to amount and term (Level 3).  
  Borrowings     - Borrowings consist of FHLB advances, subordinated debentures and other borrowings. Discounted cash flows based on current market rates for borrowings with similar remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of borrowings (Level 3).    
  Accrued interest payable - The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value (Level 1).  

38 

Commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit - The fair values of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are based upon the difference between the current value of similar loans and the price at which the Bank has committed to make the loans (Level 3). 

Note 11   Share-Based Compensation 
    
  Share-Based Compensation Expense 
    
  The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation  , during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. As a result of adoption of this ASU, excess tax benefits related to the Company's share-based compensation were recognized as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, share-based compensation expenses were $  787,000   and   $658,000  , respectively, and net tax benefits recognized from stock option exercises and restricted stock awards were $  313,000   and   $229,000  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, share-based compensation expenses were   $2.3 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively, and net tax benefits recognized from stock option exercises and restricted stock awards were   $917,000   and   $567,000  , respectively.  
    
  Unrecognized Share-Based Compensation Expense

  Restricted Stock Awards 
    
  Restricted stock awards under the Company s 2007 and 2013 Equity Compensation Plans typically vest over   three years   and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of restrictions. Hanmi Financial becomes entitled to an income tax deduction in an amount equal to the taxable income reported by the holders of the restricted shares when the restrictions are released and the shares are issued. Forfeited shares of restricted stock become available for future grants upon forfeiture. 
    
  The table below provides information for restricted stock awards for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Note 12   Off-Balance Sheet Commitments 
    
  The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk similar to the risk involved with on-balance sheet items recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.  

40 

The Bank s exposure to loan losses in the event of non-performance by the other party to commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, was based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, premises and equipment, and income-producing or borrower-occupied properties.  
    
  The following table shows the distribution of undisbursed loan commitments as of the dates indicated: 

The allowance for off-balance sheet items is maintained at a level believed to be sufficient to absorb probable losses related to these unfunded credit facilities. The determination of the allowance adequacy is based on periodic evaluations of the unfunded credit facilities including an assessment of the probability of commitment usage, credit risk factors for loans outstanding to these same customers, and the terms and expiration dates of the unfunded credit facilities. Net adjustments to the allowance for off-balance sheet items are included in other operating expenses. Activity in the allowance for loan off-balance sheet items was as follows for the periods indicated:   

Note 13   Subsequent Events 
    
  Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance of the financial data included herein. Except for disclosure included in the following paragraph, there have been no subsequent events that occurred during such period that would require disclosure in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016  , or would be required to be recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  On October 27, 2016, the Bank acquired certain leases of Irvine, California-based Banc of California ("Banc"). As part of the transaction, the Bank acquired   $209 million   of equipment leases diversified across the U.S. with concentrations in California, Georgia and Texas. An additional   $25 million   of equipment leases are expected be transferred prior to year-end 2016. The Bank will retain most of Banc's former Commercial Specialty Finance employees and the unit will operate from its headquarters located in Irvine, California, as the Company s Commercial Equipment Leasing Division.

  The following is management s discussion and analysis of the major factors that influenced our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K ) and with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016   (this  Report ). 

Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  Some of the statements under  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and elsewhere in this Report constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). All statements in this Report other than statements of historical fact are  forward-looking statements  for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including, but not limited to, statements about anticipated future operating and financial performance, financial position and liquidity, business strategies, regulatory and competitive outlook, investment and expenditure plans, capital and financing needs and availability, developments regarding our capital plans, plans and objectives of management for future operations, strategic alternatives for a possible business combination, merger or sale transactions, and other similar forecasts and statements of expectation and statements of assumption underlying any of the foregoing. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   will,   should,   could,   expects,   plans,   intends,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential,  or  continue,  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statement. These factors include the following: failure to maintain adequate levels of capital and liquidity to support our operations; the effect of potential future supervisory action against us or Hanmi Bank; general economic and business conditions internationally, nationally and in those areas in which we operate, including, but not limited to, California, Illinois and Texas; volatility and deterioration in the credit and equity markets; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; availability of capital from private and government sources; demographic changes; competition for loans and deposits and failure to attract or retain loans and deposits; fluctuations in interest rates and a decline in the level of our interest rate spread; risks of natural disasters related to our real estate portfolio; risks associated with Small Business Administration loans; failure to attract or retain key employees; changes in governmental regulation; enforcement actions against us and litigation we may become a party to; ability of Hanmi Bank to make distributions to Hanmi Financial, which is restricted by certain factors, including Hanmi Bank's retained earnings, net income, prior distributions made, and certain other financial tests; ability to successfully and efficiently integrate the operations of banks and other institutions we acquire; adequacy of our allowance for loan losses; credit quality and the effect of credit quality on our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses; changes in the financial performance and/or condition of our borrowers and the ability of our borrowers to perform under the terms of their loans and other terms of credit agreements; our ability to control expenses; and changes in securities markets. In addition, for a discussion of some of the other factors that might cause such a difference, see the discussion contained in this Report under the heading  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Also see  Item 1A. Risk Factors,   Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Interest Rate Risk Management      and  Capital Resources and Liquidity  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as other factors we identify from time to time in our periodic reports, including our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, filed pursuant to the Exchange Act. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date, on which such statements were made, except as required by law. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  We have established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We had no significant changes in our accounting policies since the filing of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Certain accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities, and we consider these critical accounting policies. For a description of these critical accounting policies, see  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ  
  
   42 

significantly from these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of Hanmi Financial s Board of Directors.

  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  The Company calculates certain supplemental financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including tangible assets, tangible stockholders' equity, tangible book value per share, core interest income and yield, and net interest income and margin excluding acquisition accounting. These non-GAAP measures are used by management in analyzing Hanmi Financial s capital strength, core loan interest income and yield, and net interest income and margin without the impact of the CBI acquisition.  
    
  Tangible equity is calculated by subtracting goodwill and core deposit intangible from stockholders  equity. Banking and financial institution regulators also exclude goodwill and core deposit intangible from stockholders  equity when assessing the capital adequacy of a financial institution. Core loan interest income and yield are calculated by subtracting accretion of discount on purchased loans. Net interest income and net interest margin are calculated by adjusting the reported amounts and  
  
   44 

rates for the impact of the CBI acquisition, including accretion of discount on purchased loans, accretion of time deposit premium and amortization of subordinated debentures discount. 
    
  Management believes the presentation of these financial measures excluding the impact of items described in the preceding paragraph provide useful supplemental information that are essential to a proper understanding of the capital strength of Hanmi Financial and our core interest income and margin. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitution for results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.

Executive Overview 
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net income was $13.1 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared with $14.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net interest income for the 2016 third quarter increased 10.0 percent or $3.6 million from the same period last year principally because of an increase in loans receivable. This increase combined with a $2.3 million decrease in incomes tax expense and a $1.3 million increase in other operating income was offset by a $2.0 million lower gain on sales of securities, a $ 2.2 million lower negative provision for loan losses, and a $3.5 million lower gains on disposition of PCI loans. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net income increased 7.9 percent to $42.1 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, compared with $39.0 million, or $1.22 per diluted share for the same period last year. Net income increased principally because of the increase in net interest income, the decrease in noninterest expenses and a lower effective tax rate. The first nine months of 2016, however, had no material gains from securities sales, a lower negative provision, and lower noninterest income compared with the first nine months of 2015 which, combined, principally offset the increases described above.  
    
  Other financial highlights include the following:

Results of Operations 
    
  Net Interest Income 
    
  Our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets, and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as volume changes. Net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities, referred to as rate changes. Interest rates charged on loans are affected principally by changes to interest rates, the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes, and other competitive factors. Those factors are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control, such as federal economic policies, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and the actions of the Federal Reserve.  
    
  The following tables show the average balances of assets, liabilities and stockholders  equity; the amount of interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, and interest expense; the average yield or rate for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; and the net interest spread and the net interest margin for the periods indicated. All average balances are daily average balances.

The table below shows changes in interest income (on a tax equivalent basis) and interest expense and the amounts attributable to variations in interest rates and volumes for the periods indicated. The variances attributable to simultaneous volume and rate changes have been allocated to the change due to volume and the change due to rate categories in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount attributable solely to the change in volume and to the change in rate.  

Interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, increased $4.7 million, or 11.8 percent, to $44.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $40.1 million for the same period in 2015. Interest expense increased $0.7 million or 5.0 percent, to $4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $4.0 million for the same period in 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, was $40.1 million and $36.1 million, respectively. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to the growth in average loans and the change in the mix of interest earning assets with average loans at 84.2 percent of average interest-earning assets for the 2016 third quarter, up from 77.1 percent for the 2015 third quarter, offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposit and increases in other borrowings balances and rates. The net interest spread and net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were 3.61 percent and 3.86 percent, respectively, compared with 3.57 percent and 3.81 percent, respectively, for the same period in 2015. Excluding the effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, net interest margin was 3.75 percent and 3.49 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
    
  Average loans increased $582.1 million, or 20.1 percent, to $3.48 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.90 billion for the same period in 2015. Average securities decreased $131.6 million, or 18.2 percent, to $589.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $721.5 million for the same period in 2015. Average interest-earning assets increased $374.4 million, or 10.0 percent, to $4.13 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.76 billion for the same period in 2015. The increase in average loans was due mainly to new loan production. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $217.8 million, or 8.9 percent, to $2.65 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $2.43 billion for the same period in 2015. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted primarily from an increase in FHLB advances and growth in money market and savings deposits, offset by a decrease in average time deposits.  In addition, average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $118.2 million, or 11.0 percent, to $1.19 billion for the 2016 third quarter from $1.07 billion for the 2015 third quarter. 
    
  The average yield on loans decreased to 4.71 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 5.00 percent for the same period in 2015, primarily due to lower loan yields and a decrease in discount accretion on purchased loans. The average yield on securities, on a taxable equivalent basis, increased to 2.18 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 1.64 percent for the same period in 2015, attributable primarily to increases in tax-exempt municipal securities.     The average yield on interest-earning assets, on a taxable equivalent basis, increased 9 basis points to 4.32 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.23 percent for the same period in 2015, due mainly to the higher percentage of loans  
  
   49 

in the mix of interest-earning assets. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 5 basis points to 0.71 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.66 percent for the same period in 2015.  
    
  The following table shows the average balances of assets, liabilities and stockholders  equity; the amount of interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, and interest expense; the average yield or rate for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; and the net interest spread and the net interest margin for the periods indicated. All average balances are daily average balances.

The variances attributable to simultaneous volume and rate changes have been allocated to the change due to volume and the change due to rate categories in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount attributable solely to the change in volume and to the change in rate.  

Interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, increased $10.1 million, or 8.2 percent, to $132.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $122.6 million for the same period in 2015. Interest expense increased $1.0 million or 8.8 percent, to $13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $12.0 million for the same period in 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, was $119.7 million and $110.6 million, respectively. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to the growth in average loans and the higher percentage of loans in the mix of interest-earning assets. Average loans were 82.4 percent of average interest-earning assets for 2016 third quarter, up from 75.0 percent for the 2015 third quarter. The net interest spread and net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were 3.71 percent and 3.95 percent, respectively, compared with 3.67 percent and 3.89 percent, respectively, for the same period in 2015. Excluding the effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, net interest margin was 3.76 percent and 3.40 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
    
  Average loans increased $481.5 million, or 16.9 percent, to $3.33 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.85 billion for the same period in 2015. Average securities decreased $191.7 million, or 23.0 percent, to $643.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $834.9 million for the same period in 2015. Average interest-earning assets increased $244.4 million, or 6.4 percent, to $4.05 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.80 billion for the same period in 2015. The increase in average loans was due mainly to new loan production. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $87.0 million, or 3.5 percent, to $2.60 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.51 billion for the same period in 2015. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted primarily from an increase in FHLB advances and growth in money market and savings deposits, offset by a decrease in average time deposits. In addition, average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $117.8 million, or 11.2 percent, to $1.17 billion for the 2016 third quarter from $1.05 billion for the 2015 third quarter. 
    
  The average yield on loans decreased to 4.84 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 5.18 percent for the same period in 2015, primarily due to lower loan yields and a decrease in discount accretion on purchased loans. The average yield on securities, on a taxable equivalent basis, increased to 2.10 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 1.57 percent for the same period in 2015, attributable primarily to increases in tax-exempt municipal securities. The average yield on interest-earning assets, on a taxable equivalent basis, increased 6 basis points to 4.38 percent for the nine  
  
   51 

months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.31 percent for the same period in 2015, due mainly to the higher percentage of loans in the mix of interest-earning assets. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 3 basis points to 0.67 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.64 percent for the same period in 2015. The increase was due to increases in the cost of borrowings. 
    
  Provision for Loan Losses 
    
  In anticipation of credit risks inherent in our lending business, we set aside an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings. These charges are made not only for our outstanding loan portfolio, but also for off-balance sheet items, such as commitments to extend credit, or letters of credit. The provisions for loan losses, whether a charge or a credit, made for our outstanding loan portfolio are recorded to the allowance for loan losses, whereas charges or credits to other noninterest expense for off-balance sheet items are recorded to the allowance for off-balance sheet items, and are presented as a component of other liabilities. 
    
  The negative provision for loan losses was $1.5 million for the   third   quarter of 2016, including a $90,000 positive provision for losses on PCI loans.  For the same period in 2015, the negative provision for loans losses was $3.7 million, which included a $1.7 million positive provision for losses on PCI loans.  The charge to other noninterest expense for losses on off-balance sheet items was $16,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a credit of $0.4 million for the same period in 2015. 
    
  The negative provision for loan losses was $4.5 million for the first nine months of 2016, which included a $0.2 million positive provision for losses on PCI loans.  For the first nine months of 2015, the negative provision for loans losses was $7.8 million, which included a $2.1 million positive provision for losses on PCI loans.  The charge to other noninterest expense for losses on off-balance sheet items was $0.5 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to a credit of $0.8 million for the same period in 2015. 
    
  See also  Allowance for Loan Losses and Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items" for further details.   
    
  Noninterest Income 
    
  The following table sets forth the various components of noninterest income for the periods indicated: 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest income was $8.7 million, a decrease of $4.9 million, or 36.0 percent, compared with $13.6 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to securities transactions and lower gains from the resolution or disposition of PCI loans. Sales of securities resulted in a net gain of $46,000 for the 2016 third quarter compared to gains of $2.0 million for the 2015 third quarter.  When a PCI loan is removed from a loan pool and the cash proceeds or assets received from the settlement of the loan are in excess of its carrying amount, we recognize such gains as disposition gains.  Disposition gains on PCI loans were $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $4.3 million the same period in 2015 as PCI loans increased slightly from an adjustment in non-accretable income for the 2016 third quarter compared with a decline of $8.7 million for the 2015 third quarter.  The increase in other operating income included a $1.0 million gain on sale of a branch facility during the third quarter of 2016.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest income was $25.0 million, a decrease of $10.5 million, or 29.6 percent, compared with $35.5 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to securities transactions and lower gains from the resolution or disposition of PCI loans. Sales of securities resulted in a net gain of $46,000 for the first nine months of 2016 compared with gains of $6.1 million for the same period in 2015.  When a PCI loan is removed from a loan pool and the cash proceeds or assets received from the settlement of the loan are in excess of its carrying amount, we recognize such gains as disposition gains.  Disposition gains on PCI loans were $3.4 million for the nine monthsended September 30, 2016 compared with $8.0 million the same period in 2015 as PCI loans declined $4.5 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared with $19.4 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in other operating income included a $1.0 million gain on sale of a branch facility during the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Noninterest Expense 
    
  The following table sets forth the components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated: 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense was $28.3 million, a decrease of $0.4 million or 1.3 percent, compared with $28.7 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to reductions in professional fees and occupancy and equipment expense from the branch closures and consolidations completed in the third quarter 2015, offset by higher other operating expenses. Other operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included a $1.4 million charge related to finalization of prior year FDIC loss share claims.

The following table sets forth the components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated: 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense was $82.3 million, a decrease of $4.9 million or 5.6 percent, compared with $87.1 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to reductions in merger and integration costs, professional fees and data processing fees related to the CBI acquisition, along with lower occupancy and equipment expense from the branch closures and consolidations completed in the third quarter 2015. These decreases were offset by an increase in other operating expenses which included a $1.4 million charge related to finalization of prior year FDIC loss share claims during the third quarter of 2016.  

Income Tax Expense 
    
  Income tax expense was $8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $10.6 million for the same period in 2015. The effective income tax rate was 38.6 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with 43.1 percent for the same period in 2015.  
    
  Income tax expense was $23.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $27.7 million for the same period in 2015. The effective income tax rate was 35.6 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with 41.6 percent for the same period in 2015. The nine-month period in 2016 included a $1.8 million benefit arising from the finalization of the 2014 amended income tax returns.  The effective income tax rate for the nine month ended September 30, 2016 would have been 38.4 percent without this benefit.

Financial Condition 
    
  Securities 
    
  Securities are classified as held to maturity, available for sale, or trading in accordance with GAAP. There were no held to maturity or trading securities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Securities classified as available for sale are stated at fair value. The composition of our securities portfolio reflects our securities strategy of providing a relatively stable source of interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity. Our securities portfolio also provides a source of liquidity by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreement and collateral for certain public funds deposits.  
    
  As of September 30, 2016, our securities portfolio was composed primarily of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and tax exempt municipal bonds. Most of the securities carried fixed interest rates. Other than holdings of U.S. government agency securities, there were no securities of any one issuer exceeding 10 percent of stockholders  equity as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
    
  The following table summarizes the amortized cost, estimated fair value and unrealized gain (loss) on securities as of the dates indicated: 

(1)   
    Collateralized by residential mortgages and guaranteed by U.S. government sponsored entities. 
        
  As of September 30, 2016, securities available for sale decreased 21.4 percent to $549.0 million, compared with $698.3 million as of December 31, 2015, due mainly to principal payments and sales of securities, offset by an increase in unrealized gains. As of September 30, 2016, securities available for sale had a net unrealized gain of $11.1 million, comprised of $11.6 million of unrealized gains and $0.5 million of unrealized losses. As of December 31, 2015, securities available for sale had a net unrealized loss of $2.3 million, comprised of $2.5 million of unrealized gains and $4.8 million of unrealized losses.

    The yield on municipal bonds has been computed on a federal tax-equivalent basis of 35 percent. 
       
  Loans Receivable, Net 
  The following table shows the loan composition by type as of the dates indicated: 

(2)   
    Includes, among other property types, mixed-use, apartment, office, industrial, faith-based facilities and warehouse; the remaining real estate categories represents less than one percent of the Bank's total loans. 
        
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans receivable (excluding loans held for sale and net of deferred loan cost, discounts and the allowance for loan losses) were $3.51 billion and $3.14 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $373.3 million, or 11.9 percent. The increase in loans as of September 30, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to new loan production of $642.2 million and residential mortgage loan purchases of $143.2 million,  
  
   56 

offset by loan pay-offs and pay-downs of $345.6 million and SBA loan sales of $61.8 million. 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, new loan production was comprised of $475.2 million in commercial real estate loans, $67.8 million in commercial and industrial loans, $94.1 million in SBA loans, and $5.1 million in consumer loans.  
    
  Our loan portfolio included the following concentrations of loans to one type of industry that were greater than 10 percent of loans outstanding (includes real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans): 

There was no other concentration of loans to any one type of industry exceeding 10.0 percent of loans outstanding. 
    
  Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Assets 
    
  Nonperforming loans (excluding PCI loans) consist of loans on nonaccrual status and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and OREO. Non-purchased credit impaired ( Non-PCI ) loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the opinion of management, the full timely collection of principal or interest is in doubt. Generally, the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest payments become more than 90 days past due, unless we believe the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection. However, in certain instances, we may place a particular loan on nonaccrual status earlier, depending upon the individual circumstances surrounding the loan s delinquency. When an asset is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current income. Subsequent collections of cash are applied as principal reductions when received, except when the ultimate collectability of principal is probable, in which case interest payments are credited to income. Nonaccrual assets may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest become current and full repayment is expected. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis for impaired loans not meeting the criteria for nonaccrual. OREO consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale.  
    
  Except for nonperforming loans set forth below and PCI loans, we are not aware of any loans as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 for which known credit problems of the borrower would cause serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their present loan repayment terms, or any known events that would result in the loan being designated as nonperforming at some future date. We cannot, however, predict the extent to which a deterioration in general economic conditions, real estate values, increases in general rates of interest, or changes in the financial condition or business of borrower may adversely affect a borrower s ability to pay.  

57 

The following table provides information with respect to the components of nonperforming assets (excluding PCI loans) as of the dates indicated: 

Nonaccrual Non-PCI loans were $10.9 million as of September 30, 2016, compared with $19.1 million as of December 31, 2015, representing a decrease of $8.2 million, or 42.7 percent. There were no Non-PCI loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $6.9 million of loans were placed on nonaccrual status. These additions to nonaccrual loans were mainly offset by $4.0 million of nonaccrual loans restored to accrual status, $5.1 million in principal payoffs and paydowns, $1.8 million in charge-offs and $3.8 million in transfers to OREO. 
    
  Delinquent Non-PCI loans (defined as 30 to 89 days past due and still accruing) were $3.1 million as of September 30, 2016, compared with $6.7 million as of December 31, 2015. 
    
  The ratio of nonperforming Non-PCI loans to Non-PCI loans decreased to 0.31 percent at September 30, 2016 from 0.60 percent at December 31, 2015. Of the $10.9 million nonperforming Non-PCI loans, approximately $10.3 million were impaired based on the definition contained in ASC 310,   Receivables  , which resulted in aggregate impairment reserve of $3.1 million as of September 30, 2016. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans is calculated as the difference between the outstanding loan balance and the value of the collateral as determined by recent appraisals less estimated costs to sell. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans varies from loan to loan based on the collateral coverage of the loan at the time of designation as nonperforming. We continue to monitor the collateral coverage, based on recent appraisals, on these loans on a quarterly basis and adjust the allowance accordingly. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, OREO consisted of 15 properties with a combined carrying value of $11.0 million, as compared with 14 properties with a combined carrying value of $8.5 million as of December 31, 2015.  

58 

Impaired Loans 
    
  We evaluate loan impairment in accordance with GAAP. With the exception of PCI loans, loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled interest payments. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or, as an expedient, at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, less costs to sell. If the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses or, alternatively, a specific allocation will be established. Additionally, impaired loans are specifically excluded from the quarterly migration analysis when determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses required for the period.  
    
  The following table provides information on impaired loans (excluding PCI loans) as of the dates indicated:  

Total impaired loans decreased $12.0 million, or 33.3 percent, to $23.9 million as of September 30, 2016, as compared with $35.9 million at December 31, 2015. Specific allowances associated with impaired loans were $3.2 million and $4.4 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
    
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest income that would have been recognized had impaired loans performed in accordance with their original terms totaled $0.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Of these amounts, actual interest recognized on impaired loans was $0.5 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest income that would have been recognized had impaired loans performed in accordance with their original terms totaled $2.3 million and $3.4 million, respectively. Of these amounts, actual interest recognized on impaired loans was $1.8 million and $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

59 

The following table provides information on TDRs (excluding PCI loans) as of the dates indicated: 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we restructured monthly payments for one loan with a net carrying value of $100,000 at the time of modification, which we subsequently classified as TDRs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we restructured monthly payments for five loans, with a net carrying value of $356,000 at the time of modification, which we subsequently classified as TDRs. Temporary payment structure modifications included, but were not limited to, extending the maturity date, reducing the amount of principal and/or interest due monthly, and/or allowing for interest only monthly payments for nine months or less. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, TDRs on accrual status were $10.5 million, all of which were temporary interest rate and payment reductions or extensions of maturity, and a $0.1 million allowance relating to these loans was included in the allowance for loan losses. For the TDRs on accrual status, we determined that, based on the financial capabilities of the borrowers at the time of the loan restructuring and the borrowers  past performance in the payment of debt service under the previous loan terms, performance and collection under the revised terms is probable. As of September 30, 2016, TDRs on nonaccrual status were $4.4 million, and a $0.5 million allowance relating to these loans was included in the allowance for loan losses. 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, TDRs on accrual status were $10.3 million, all of which were temporary interest rate and payment reductions or extensions of maturity, and a $0.9 million allowance relating to these loans was included in the allowance for loan losses. For the TDRs on accrual status, we determined that, based on the financial capabilities of the borrowers at the time of the loan restructuring and the borrowers  past performance in the payment of debt service under the previous loan terms, performance and collection under the revised terms is probable. As of December 31, 2015, TDRs on nonaccrual status were $6.9 million, and a $0.1 million allowance relating to these loans was included in the allowance for loan losses.  
    
  Allowance for Loan Losses and Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items 
    
  The Bank charges or credits operating expenses for provisions to the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for off-balance sheet items at least quarterly based upon the allowance need. The allowance is determined through an analysis involving quantitative calculations based on historic loss rates and qualitative adjustments for general reserves and individual impairment calculations for specific allocations. The Bank charges the allowance for actual losses and credits the allowance for recoveries on loans previously charged-off. 
    
  The Bank evaluates the allowance methodology at least annually. In the fourth quarter of 2015, based upon an evaluation of the look-back periods, the loss-emergence periods and the qualitative adjustments, the Bank utilized a 20-quarter look-back period with equal weighting to all quarters in order to reflect the lengthening of the business cycle and to capture sufficient loss observations for the estimate of a reliable loss rate. In addition, the Bank determined that there were no indications that the loss migration analysis changed significantly; however, these factors do not materially affect the estimated loss rates. In addition, the Bank re-evaluated the qualitative adjustments, reducing their affect in light of the lengthening of the  
  
   60 

business cycle and the continued improvement in credit metrics. Improving credit metrics included, among other things, net loan recoveries, a low level of nonperforming non-PCI loans to loans and a low level of classified loans to loans. 
    
  From first quarter of 2014 to the third quarter of 2015, based upon a similar evaluation, the Bank utilized a 16-quarter look-back period, weighing the loss factors 46 percent for the most recent four-quarter period and 31 percent, 15 percent and 8 percent for each of the following four-quarter periods, respectively. 
    
  To determine general reserve requirements, existing loans are divided into fourteen general loan pools of risk-rated loans, as well as three homogeneous loan pools. For risk-rated loans, migration analysis allocates historical losses by loan pool and risk grade to determine risk factors for potential loss inherent in the current outstanding loan portfolio. As three homogeneous loans are bulk graded, the risk grade is not factored into the historical loss analysis. In addition, specific reserves are allocated for loans deemed  impaired.  
    
  When determining the appropriate level for allowance for loan losses, management considers qualitative adjustments for any factors that are likely to cause estimated loan losses associated with the Bank s current portfolio to differ from historical 
  loss experience, including, but not limited to, national and local economic and business conditions, volume and geographic 
  concentrations, and problem loan trends. 
    
  To systematically quantify the credit risk impact of trends and changes within the loan portfolio, a credit risk matrix is 
  utilized. The qualitative factors are considered on a loan pool by loan pool basis subsequent to, and in conjunction with, a loss 
  migration analysis. The credit risk matrix provides various scenarios with positive or negative impact on the portfolio along 
  with corresponding basis points for qualitative adjustments. 
    
  The following tables reflect our allocation of allowance for loan losses by loan category as well as the loans receivable for each loan type: 

61 

62 

The following tables set forth certain information regarding allowance for loan losses and allowance for off-balance sheet items for the periods presented. Allowance for off-balance sheet items is determined by applying reserve factors according to loan pool and grade as well as actual current commitment usage figures by loan type to existing contingent liabilities.

    Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) are annualized to calculate the ratios.

    Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) are annualized to calculate the ratios. 
       
  Allowance for loan losses was $39.0 million, $42.9 million and $46.4 million, as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2015, respectively.  The decrease of $3.9 million, or 9.1 percent in the allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2016, compared with December 31, 2015 was due primarily to the decline in estimated loss factors and improvements in classified loans. Accordingly, the non-PCI loan loss allowance decreased by $4.1 million to $33.4 million as of September 30, 2016, compared with $37.5 million at December 31, 2015. The PCI loan loss allowance increased by $0.1 million to $5.5 million as of September 30, 2016, compared with $5.4 million at December 31, 2015.  
    
  An allowance for off-balance sheet exposure, primarily unfunded loan commitments, as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 was $1.5 million, $1.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The increase in the allowance for off-balance sheet exposure as of September 30, 2016, compared with December 31, 2015 was due primarily to the increase in unfunded loan commitments to $330.1 million as of September 30, 2016, from $262.7 million as of December 31, 2015. The Bank closely monitors the borrower s repayment capabilities, while funding existing commitments to ensure losses are minimized.  
    
  Based on management s evaluation and analysis of portfolio credit quality and prevailing economic conditions, we believe these allowances are adequate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio and for off-balance sheet exposures as of September 30, 2016. 
  
   64 

The following table presents a summary of net recoveries (charge-offs) by the loan portfolio: 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, total charge-offs were $0.1 million, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 93.6 percent from $1.8 million for the same period in 2015, and total recoveries were $0.8 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 16.2 percent, from $1.0 million for the same period in 2015. For the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016, total charge-offs were $1.4 million, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 53.1 percent from $3.0 million for the same period in 2015, and total recoveries were $2.1 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 53.6 percent, from $4.5 million for the same period in 2015. 
  
   65 

Deposits 
    
  The following table shows the composition of deposits by type as of the dates indicated: 

Deposits increased $261.2 million, or 7.4 percent, to $3.77 billion as of September 30, 2016 from $3.51 billion as of December 31, 2015. The increase in deposits was mainly attributable to the $76.4 million and $370.6 million increase in  noninterest-bearing demand deposits and money market and savings deposits, respectively, offset by $185.5 million decrease in time deposits. The decrease in time deposits were primarily due to maturities of higher rate time deposits assumed from CBI acquisition.   
    
  Core deposits (defined as demand, money market and savings and other time deposits) increased $312.6 million, or 11.9 percent, to $2.94 billion at September 30, 2016 from $2.63 billion at December 31, 2015. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits as a percentage of deposits was 32.7 percent at September 30, 2016 compared with 32.9 percent at December 31, 2015.  
    
  Borrowings 
    
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were   $55.0 million   and   $170.0 million   in overnight advances from the FHLB, respectively.  The reduction in FHLB advances was supported by the increase in deposits for the 2016 third quarter.  In addition, subordinated debentures were   $18.9 million   and   $18.7 million   at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the change representing the accretion of acquisition discount. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk Management 
    
  Interest rate risk indicates our exposure to market interest rate fluctuations. The movement of interest rates directly and inversely affects the economic value of fixed-income assets, which is the present value of future cash flow discounted by the current interest rate; under the same conditions, the higher the current interest rate, the higher the denominator of discounting. Interest rate risk management is intended to decrease or increase the level of our exposure to market interest rates. The level of interest rate risk can be managed through such means as the changing of gap positions and the volume of fixed-income assets. For successful management of interest rate risk, we use various methods to measure existing and future interest rate risk exposures, giving effect to historical attrition rates of core deposits. In addition to regular reports used in business operations, repricing gap analysis, stress testing and simulation modeling are the main measurement techniques used to quantify interest rate risk exposure. 

66 

The following table shows the status of our gap position as of September 30, 2016: 

The repricing gap analysis measures the static timing of repricing risk of assets and liabilities (i.e., a point-in-time analysis measuring the difference between assets maturing or repricing in a period and liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period). Assets are assigned to maturity and repricing categories based on their expected repayment or repricing dates, and liabilities are assigned based on their repricing or maturity dates. Interest-bearing core deposits that have no maturity dates (savings, and money market checking and NOW accounts) are assigned to categories based on expected decay rates. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the cumulative repricing gap for the three-month period was at an asset-sensitive position and was 11.93 percent of interest-earning assets, which decreased from 13.56 percent as of December 31, 2015. This decrease was due mainly to a $60.4 million decrease in interest-bearing deposits in other banks, $24.8 million and $30.5 million decrease in floating rate securities and loans, respectively, and a $35.6 million increase in time deposits, mainly offset by a $115.0 million decrease in FHLB advances. 
  
   67 

As of September 30, 2016, the cumulative repricing gap for the twelve-month period was at an asset-sensitive position and was 6.78 percent of interest-earning assets, which increased from 1.79 percent of an asset-sensitive position as of December 31, 2015. This decrease was due mainly to a $60.4 million decrease in interest-bearing deposits in other banks, a $69.6 million decrease in floating rate securities, a $66.9 million increase in money market and savings deposits, mainly offset by a $115.0 million decrease in FHLB advances, a $39.0 million increase in fixed rate loans, $73.1 million increase in floating rate loans and a $182.7 million decrease in time deposits. 
       
  The following table summarizes the status of the cumulative gap position as of the dates indicated: 

The spread between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities is the principal component of net interest income, and interest rate changes substantially affect our financial performance. We emphasize capital protection through stable earnings rather than maximizing yield. In order to achieve stable earnings, we prudently manage our assets and liabilities and closely monitor the percentage changes in net interest income and economic equity value in relation to limits established within our guidelines. 
    
  To supplement traditional gap analysis, we perform simulation modeling to estimate the potential effects of interest rate changes. The following table summarizes one of the stress simulations performed to forecast the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the economic value of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities reflected on our balance sheet (i.e., an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of the magnitude indicated below). This sensitivity analysis is compared to policy limits, which specify the maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one-year horizon, given the basis point adjustment in interest rates reflected below. 

(1)   
    Results are not meaningful in a low interest rate environment. 
       
  The estimated sensitivity does not necessarily represent our forecast, and the results may not be indicative of actual changes to our net interest income. These estimates are based upon a number of assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, pricing strategies on loans and deposits, and replacement of asset and liability cash flows. While the assumptions used are based on current economic and local market conditions, there is no assurance as to the predictive nature of these conditions, including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change. 
    
  Capital Resources 
    
  Historically, our primary source of capital has been the retention of operating earnings. In order to ensure adequate levels of capital, the Board continually assesses projected sources and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and levels of risk. Management considers, among other things, earnings generated from operations, and access to capital from financial markets through the issuance of additional securities, including common stock or notes, to meet our capital needs. 

68 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s total risk-based capital ratio of   14.61   percent, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of   13.50   percent, common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of   13.50   percent and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of   11.36   percent, placed the Bank in the  well capitalized  category pursuant to new capital rule, which is defined as institutions with total risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 10.00 percent, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 8.00 percent, common equity Tier 1 capital ratios equal to or greater than 6.50 percent and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio equal to or greater than 5.00 percent.

  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , to reduce the complexity of certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions. As a result of this ASU, changes applicable to all entities include: 1) minimum statutory withholding requirements; under the ASU, the threshold to qualify for equity classification would permit withholding up to the maximum individual statutory tax rate in the applicable jurisdictions. Also, the ASU provides that cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes would be classified as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows; 2) accounting for forfeitures; the ASU would allow an entity to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur; 3) accounting for income taxes; under the ASU, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies would be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. An entity also would recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. Further, excess tax benefits would not be separated from other income tax cash flows and thus would be classified along with other cash flows as an operating activity. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public entities for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016 and it did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. For additional details see Note 11 - Share-Based Compensation included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which replaced existing revenue recognition guidance for contracts to provide goods or services to customers and amended existing guidance related to recognition of gains and losses on the sale of certain non-financial assets such as real estate. ASU 2014-09 established a principles-based approach to recognizing revenue that applies to all contracts other than those covered by other authoritative GAAP guidance. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows were also required. ASU 2014-09 was to be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and was to be applied on either a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which defers the original effective date for all entities by one year. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2015-14 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  The Company s preliminary analysis suggests that the adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. However, there are many aspects of the new accounting guidance that are still being interpreted. The results of our materiality analysis may change based on the conclusion reached as to the application of the new guidance.

In January, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   (ASU 2016-01).  Changes to the current GAAP model primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.  In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.  The accounting for other financial instruments, such as loans, investments in debt securities, and financial liabilities is largely unchanged.  The classification and measurement guidance will be effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  All entities can early adopt the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. Early adoption of these provisions can be elected for all financial statements of fiscal years and interim periods that have not yet been issued (for public business entities) or that have not yet been made available for issuance. The classification and measurement guidance is the first ASU issued under the FASB s financial instruments project. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . While both lessees and lessors are affected by the new guidance, the effects on the lessees are much more significant. The most significant change for lessees is the requirement under the new guidance to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases not considered short-term leases. By definition, a short-term lease is one in which: (a) the lease term is 12 months or less and (b) there is not an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. For short-term leases, lessees may elect an accounting policy by class of underlying asset under which right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are not recognized and lease payments are generally recognized as expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Adoption of this ASU will result in lessees recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases currently accounted for as operating leases under existing lease accounting guidance. For many entities, this could significantly affect the financial ratios they use for external reporting and other purposes, such as debt covenant compliance. Examples of changes in the new guidance affecting both lessees and lessors include: (a) defining initial direct costs to only include those incremental costs that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been entered into, (b) requiring related party leases to be accounted for based on their legally enforceable terms and conditions, (c) eliminating the additional requirements that currently must be applied to leases involving real estate and (d) revising the circumstances under which the transfer contract in a sale-leaseback transaction should be accounted for as the sale of an asset by the seller-lessee and the purchase of an asset by the buyer-lessor. In addition, both lessees and lessors are subject to new disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public entities for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)  , which introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope.  The new guidance introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination.  Current expected credit losses ( CECL ) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost; and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, loan commitments, financial guarantees, and net investments in leases, as well as reinsurance and trade receivables. Upon initial recognition of the exposure, the CECL model requires an entity to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). The estimate of expected credit losses should consider historical information, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. Financial instruments with similar risk characteristics should be grouped together when estimating expected credit losses. The ASU does not prescribe a specific method to make the estimate so its application will require significant judgment.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for public entities for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early application of the guidance will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, Hanmi Financial carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer). The purpose of the disclosure controls and procedures is to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
    
  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Hanmi Financial s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.
