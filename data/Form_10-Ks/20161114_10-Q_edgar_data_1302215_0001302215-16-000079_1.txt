(1) BACKGROUND 
  Houlihan Lokey, Inc. ("Houlihan Lokey," or "HL, Inc." also referred to as the "Company," "we," "our," or "us") is a Delaware corporation that controls the following primary subsidiaries: 
             
    Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc., a California corporation ("HL Capital, Inc."),  is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of HL, Inc.  HL Capital, Inc. is registered as a broker-dealer under Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. 

Houlihan Lokey Financial Advisors, Inc., a California corporation ("HL FA, Inc."), is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of HL, Inc.  HL FA, Inc. is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. 

Houlihan Lokey (Europe) Limited, a limited company incorporated in England ("HL Europe, Ltd."), is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of HL, Inc.  HL Europe, Ltd. is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom ("U.K."). 
       
  On August 18, 2015, the Company successfully completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of its Class A common stock. 
  Prior to a corporate reorganization that was consummated immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, the Company was incorporated in California as Houlihan Lokey, Inc., a California corporation ("HL CA"), and was a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Fram Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Fram"), which, in turn, was a majority owned subsidiary of ORIX USA Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("ORIX USA"), with the remaining minority interest being held by Company employees ("HL Holders"). ORIX USA and the HL Holders held their interests in HL CA indirectly through their ownership of Fram. On July 24, 2015, HL CA merged with and into HL, Inc., with HL, Inc. as the surviving entity. In connection with the IPO, the HL Holders deposited their shares of HL, Inc. Class B common stock into a voting trust (the "HL Voting Trust") and own such common stock through the HL Voting Trust. Houlihan Lokey has separated from Fram and as a result, HL, Inc. common stock is held directly by ORIX USA (through ORIX HLHZ Holding, LLC, its wholly owned subsidiary), the HL Voting Trust, for the benefit of the HL Holders, non-employee directors, and public shareholders.   
  In addition, prior to the consummation of the IPO, the Company distributed to its existing owners a dividend of   $270.0 million  , consisting of (i) a short-term note in the aggregate amount of   $197.2 million  , which was repaid immediately after the consummation of the IPO, and was allocated   $94.5 million   to ORIX USA and   $102.7 million   to the HL Holders, (ii) a note to ORIX USA in the amount of   $45.0 million   (see Note 7), and (iii) certain of our non-operating assets to certain of the HL Holders (consisting of non-marketable minority equity interests in   four   separate businesses that range in carrying value from   $2.5 million   to   $11.0 million  , and valued in the aggregate at approximately   $22.8 million   as of June 30, 2015, together with   $5.0 million   in cash to be used to complete a potential additional investment and in the administration of these assets in the future. All issued and outstanding Fram shares were converted to HL, Inc. common stock at a ratio of   10.425   shares for each share of Fram stock. Immediately following the IPO, there were   two   classes of authorized HL, Inc. common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion rights. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to   one   vote per share, and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to   ten   votes per share. Each share of Class B common stock may be converted into   one   share of Class A common stock at the option of its holder and will be automatically converted into one share of Class A common stock upon transfer thereof, subject to certain exceptions. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   12,159,427   Class A shares held by the public, of which   18,661   Class A shares are held by non-employee directors,   32,938,647   Class B shares held by the HL Voting Trust, and   21,610,331   Class B shares held by ORIX USA. 
  The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of its Class A common stock in the IPO.

  The Company offers financial services and financial advice to a broad clientele located throughout the United States of America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. The Company has U.S. offices in Los Angeles, Newport Beach, San Francisco, Chicago, New York City, Minneapolis, McLean (Virginia), Dallas, Houston, Miami, and Atlanta as well as foreign offices in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Beijing. Together, the Company and its subsidiaries form an organization that provides financial services to meet a wide variety of client needs. The Company concentrates its efforts toward the earning of professional fees with focused services across the following   three   business segments: 

Corporate Finance provides general financial advisory services in addition to advice on mergers and acquisitions and capital markets offerings. We advise public and private institutions on a wide variety of situations, including buy-side and sell-side transactions, as well as leveraged loans, private mezzanine debt, high-yield debt, initial public offerings, follow-ons, convertibles, equity private placements, private equity, and liability management transactions, and advise financial sponsors on all types of transactions. The majority of our Corporate Finance revenues consists of fees paid upon the successful completion of the transaction or engagement ("Completion Fees"). A Corporate Finance transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons that are outside of our control. In these instances, our fees are generally limited to the  fees paid at the time an engagement letter is signed ("Retainer Fees") and in some cases fees paid during the course of the engagement ("Progress Fees") that may have been earned.    

Financial Restructuring provides advice to debtors, creditors and other parties-in-interest in connection with recapitalization/deleveraging transactions implemented both through bankruptcy proceedings and though out-of-court exchanges, consent solicitations or other mechanisms, as well as in distressed mergers and acquisitions and capital markets activities. As part of these engagements, our Financial Restructuring business segment offers a wide range of advisory services to our clients, including: the structuring, negotiation, and confirmation of plans of reorganization; structuring and analysis of exchange offers; corporate viability assessment; dispute resolution and expert testimony; and procuring debtor in possession financing. Although atypical, a Financial Restructuring transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons that are outside of our control. In these instances, our fees are generally limited to the initial Retainer Fees and/or Progress Fees.    

Financial Advisory Services primarily provides valuations of various assets including: companies, illiquid debt and equity securities, and intellectual property (among other assets and liabilities). These valuations are used for financial reporting, tax reporting, and other purposes. In addition, our Financial Advisory Services business segment renders fairness opinions in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other transactions, and solvency opinions in connection with corporate spin-offs and dividend recapitalizations, and other types of financial opinions in connection with other transactions. Also, our Financial Advisory Services business segment provides dispute resolution services to clients where fees are usually based on the hourly rates of our financial professionals. Lastly, our Financial Advisory Services business segment provides strategic consulting services to clients where fees are either fixed or based on the hourly rates of our consulting professionals.  Unlike our Corporate Finance or Financial Restructuring segments, the fees generated in our Financial Advisory Services segment are generally not contingent on the successful completion of a transaction.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
           (a) 
    Basis of Presentation 
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and include all information and footnotes required for consolidated financial statement presentation. The results of operations for the   three and six   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the year ending March 31, 2017. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.  
           (b) 
    Principles of Consolidation 
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries where it has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The Company carries its investments in unconsolidated entities over which it has significant influence but does not control using the equity method, and includes its ownership share of the income and losses in other (expenses) income, net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
           (c) 
    Use of Estimates 
     The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Management estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the allowance for doubtful accounts; the valuation of deferred tax assets, goodwill, accrued expenses, and share based compensation; the allocation of goodwill and other assets across the reporting units (segments); and reserves for income tax uncertainties and other contingencies. 
           (d) 
    Recognition of Revenue 
     Revenues consist primarily of professional service fees. 
  The Company and its clients enter into agreements that outline the general terms and conditions of the specific engagements. The Company performs professional services in accordance with the engagement terms on both a fixed and contingent fee basis. 
  Revenues are recognized when earned and realizable. Revenues under fixed fee contracts are recognized based on management s estimates of the relative proportion of services provided through the financial reporting date to the total services required to be performed. The recognition of revenues under contingent fee contracts depends on whether the revenues relate to monthly retainers or success fees. Monthly retainers are generally recognized on a monthly basis, except in situations where there is uncertainty as to the timing of collection of the amount due. Success fees are recognized only upon substantial completion of the contingencies stipulated by the engagement agreement. In some cases, approval of the Company s fees is required from the courts or other regulatory authority; in these circumstances, the recognition of revenue is often deferred until approval is granted; however, if the fee that is going to be collected from the client is fixed and determinable, and the collectability of the fee is reasonably assured, there are instances when revenue recognition prior to such approval is appropriate.

  (All tables and balances are in thousands, except share data) 

Engagements related to Financial Advisory Services are most often structured as fixed fee contracts, and engagements related to Corporate Finance and Financial Restructuring are most often structured as contingent fee contracts. Further, Financial Restructuring contracts are commonly subject to the applicable court s approval. 
  In those instances when the revenue recognized on a specific engagement exceeds both the amounts billed and the amounts collected, unbilled work-in-process is recorded. Billed receivables are recorded as accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Deferred income results when cash is received in advance of dates when revenues are recognized. 
  Taxes, including value added taxes, collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis, and therefore, are excluded from revenue in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
           (e) 
    Operating Expenses 
     The majority of the Company s operating expenses are related to compensation for employees, which includes the amortization of the relevant portion of the Company s share-based incentive plans (note 10). Other examples of operating expenses include: travel, meals and entertainment; rent; depreciation and amortization; information technology and communications; professional fees; and other operating expenses, which include such items as office expenses, business license and registration fees, non-income-related taxes, legal expenses, related-party support services, and charitable contributions. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company received reimbursements of   $7,082   and   $7,946  , respectively, and during the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company received reimbursements of   $14,561   and   $12,028  , respectively, from customers for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company that are presented net against the related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
           (f) 
    Translation of Foreign Currency Transactions 
     The reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are included in the consolidation by translating the assets and liabilities at the reporting period-end exchange rates; however, revenues and expenses are translated using the applicable exchange rates determined on a monthly basis throughout the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. 
  From time to time, we have entered into transactions to hedge our exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or other methods. In September 2016, we entered in to a foreign currency forward contract between the U.S. dollar and pound sterling with an aggregate notional value of   $3.0 million   and with a fair value representing a   gain   included in other operating expenses of   $0.2 million   during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
           (g) 
    Property and Equipment 
     Property and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance charges are expensed as incurred and costs of renewals or improvements are capitalized at cost. 
  Depreciation on furniture and office equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life. 
           (h) 
    Cash and Cash Equivalents 
     Cash and cash equivalents include cash held at banks and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. As of   September 30, 2016   and March 31, 2016, the Company had cash balances with banks in excess of insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in its cash accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents. 
  Although not classified as cash and cash equivalents, included in the Company s receivable from affiliates (note 3), are amounts due on demand, which generally arose from the transfer of available cash from HL, Inc. to ORIX USA and

  (All tables and balances are in thousands, except share data) 

affiliates of ORIX USA. The amount due from ORIX USA was repaid in August 2015 and the amount due from an affiliate of ORIX USA with an outstanding balance of   $20,136   as of March 31, 2016 was repaid in full in May 2016. 
           (i) 
    Accounts Receivable 
     The allowance for doubtful accounts on receivables reflects management s best estimate of probable inherent losses determined principally on the basis of historical experience and review of uncollected revenues and is recorded through provision for bad debts in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Amounts deemed to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. 
           (j) 
    Income Taxes 
     Prior to the IPO, ORIX USA and its subsidiaries, including the Company, filed consolidated federal income tax returns and separate returns in state and local jurisdictions and did so for fiscal 2016 through the date of the IPO. The Company reported income tax expense as if it filed separate returns in all jurisdictions. Following the IPO, the Company files a consolidated federal income tax return separate from ORIX USA, as well as consolidated and separate returns in state and local jurisdictions, and the Company reports income tax expense on this basis. 
           (k) 
    Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
     Goodwill represents an acquired company s acquisition cost over the fair value of acquired net tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill is the net asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Intangible assets identified and accounted for include tradenames and marks, backlog, developed technologies, and customer relationships. Those intangible assets with finite lives, including backlog and customer relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives. 
  When HL CA was acquired by Fram in January 2006, approximately   $392,600   of goodwill and   $192,210   of indefinite-lived intangible assets were generated and recognized. In accordance with ASC Topic 805,   Business Combinations  , since HL CA was wholly owned by Fram, this goodwill and all other purchase accounting-related adjustments were pushed down to the Company s reporting level. Through both foreign and domestic acquisitions made directly by HL CA and the Company since 2006, additional goodwill of approximately   $122,905  , inclusive of foreign currency translations, has been recognized. 
  Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and more frequently if potential impairment indicators exist. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08,   Testing Goodwill for Impairment  , which permits management to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that one of its reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. If management concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then management would not be required to perform the two-step impairment test for that reporting unit. If the assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value, management must test further for impairment utilizing a two-step process. Step 1 compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment exists and is measured in Step 2 as the excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill resulting from the valuation of the reporting unit. Impairment testing of goodwill requires a significant amount of judgment in assessing qualitative factors and estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, if necessary. The fair value is determined using an estimated market value approach, which considers estimates of future after tax cash flows, including a terminal value based on market earnings multiples, discounted at an appropriate market rate. As of and during the   three and six  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , management has concluded that it is not more likely than not that the Company s reporting units  fair value is less than its carrying amount and no further impairment testing had been considered necessary. 
  Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with ASU 2012-02,   Testing Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets for Impairment  , which provides management the option to perform a qualitative assessment. If it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value is recorded as an impairment expense. As of and during the   three and six  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , management has concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values were less than the carrying values.

Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group (inclusive of other long-lived assets) be tested for possible impairment, management first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. As of and during the   three and six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , no events or changes in circumstances were identified that indicated that the carrying amount of the finite-lived intangible assets were not recoverable. 
           (l) 
    Fair Value Measurements 
     The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels in accordance with ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurement  : 
             
    Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date. 
                
    Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
                
    Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
     In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ,   Deferral of Effective Date   which deferred the effective date of the new standard to annual and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017 (year ended March 31, 2019 for the Company). The new standard is to be applied using either the retrospective or cumulative-effective transition method. The Company expects to implement the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09 as of April 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its current policies for revenue recognition. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurements - Period Adjustments  , which requires an acquirer to recognize measurement period adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized in a business combination in the reporting period during which the adjustment amounts are determined.  Additionally, the amendments in this ASU require the acquirer to record in the same period s financial statements the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the measurement period adjustment, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date as well as disclosing either on the face of the income statement or in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods. ASU No. 2015-16 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 (year ended March 31, 2017 for the Company).  The new standard is to be applied prospectively.  The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-16 and it did not have a material impact on the Company's operating results and financial position.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  .  The amendments in this ASU requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.  For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability. Additionally, when measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, optional payments should be included only if the lessee is reasonable certain to exercise an option to extend the lease, exercise a purchase option, or not exercise an option to terminate the lease.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (year ended March 31, 2020 for the Company). Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its operating results and financial position. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 but anticipates that such adoption will not have a material impact on its operating results and financial position. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation.    The amendments in this ASU modified several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies.  The amendments in this ASU also clarify the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards.  ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (year ended March 31, 2018 for the Company).  Early application is permitted.  The Company did not adopt early and is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 but anticipates that such adoption may have a material impact on its operating results and financial position. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .  The amendments in this ASU include eight specific guidance for cash flow classification issues for (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) debt instruments with coupon interest rates, (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) settlement proceeds from insurance claims, (5) settlement proceeds from corporate-owned life insurance policies, (6) distributions received from equity method investees, (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and (8) classification of cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (year ended March 31, 2019 for the Company). The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its operating results and financial position. Management does not believe this guidance will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

certain financial ratios.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   principal was outstanding under the line of credit and for the three and six months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company paid interest of   $138   and   $288  , respectively, under the line of credit. 
    
  Prior to the IPO, Fram maintained certain loans payable to former shareholders consisting of unsecured notes payable which were transferred to the Company in conjunction to the IPO. As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate on the individual notes was   2.15%   and the maturity dates range from 2016 to 2027. The Company plans to pay off these loans before the maturity dates. The Company incurred interest expense on these notes of    $43   and   $113   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and   $132   and   $113   during the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.

This loan bears interest at an annual rate of   1.50%  . For the three and six months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred   $59   and   $118   in interest expense on this loan, respectively. 
  See note 13 for aggregated 5-year maturity table on loans payable. 
   
  (8) OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS 
  The only component of other comprehensive income relates to foreign currency translation adjustments of   $(2,318)   and   $(1,694)   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $(6,184)   and   $(1,287)   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The change in foreign currency translation had a negative impact on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, which was negatively impacted by the vote in the U.K. to withdraw from the European Union. There will be a two-year time period in which the terms of withdrawal will be negotiated and there may be impacts on our European business that are unknown at this time. We believe the change in foreign currency translation will become more volatile, but we do not expect this to have a material impact on our operating results and financial position.  
  Accumulated other comprehensive loss at   September 30, 2016   was comprised of the following: 

(9) INCOME TAXES 
  The Company s provision for income taxes were   $13,352   and    $25,894   for the three and six months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $7,849   and   $17,879   for the three and six months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  This represents effective tax rates of   39.0%   and   39.1%   for the three and six months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively and   45.9%   and   42.4%   for the three and six months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The decrease in the Company s tax rate during the three and six month periods ended   September 30, 2016   relative to the same periods in 2015 was primarily as a result of the expected growth and improved profitability of our non-U.S. business in fiscal 2017. 
   
  (10) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
           (a) 
    Defined Contribution Plans 
     The Company sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for its domestic employees and defined contribution retirement plans for its international employees. The Company contributed approximately   $386   and   $368   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $835   and   $748   during the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, to these defined contribution plans.

Prior to the IPO, HL CA had no stock-based incentive compensation plans; however, during the period it was a subsidiary of Fram, certain employees of HL CA were granted restricted shares of Fram. Compensation expenses related to these shares was recorded at the HL CA level as it was related to services provided by its employees. Under its 2006 incentive plan (the "2006 Incentive Plan"), Fram granted restricted share awards to employees of the Company as a component of annual incentive pay and occasionally in conjunction with new hire employment. Under 2006 Incentive Plan, awards typically vested after   three   years of service from the date of grant. Prior to the IPO, the grant-date fair value of each award was determined by Fram's board of directors using input from a third party, which used a combination of historical and forecasted results and market data. The methods used to estimate the fair value of Fram shares included the market approach and the income approach. For a further discussion related to the methods used, please see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. In addition, the stock grants to employees of the Company in connection with the IPO were made under the 2006 Incentive Plan (note 1). 
  Following the IPO, additional awards of restricted shares have been and will be made under the Company's 2016 Incentive Award Plan (the "2016 Incentive Plan"), which became effective in August 2015. Under the 2016 Incentive Plan, it is anticipated that the Company will continue to grant cash- and equity-based incentive awards to eligible service providers in order to attract, motivate and retain the talent necessary to operate the Company's business.  Equity-based incentive awards issued under the 2016 Incentive Plan generally vest over a   four  -year period.  An aggregate of   18,661   restricted shares of Class A common stock were granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan to   two   independent directors in August 2015 at   $21.00   per share,   two   independent directors in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 at   $25.21   per share and   one   independent director in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 at   $23.93   per share.  
  The share awards are classified as equity awards at the time of grant unless the number of shares granted is unknown. Award offers that are settleable in shares based upon a future determinable stock price are classified as a liability until the price is established and the resulting number of shares is known, at which time they are re-classified from liabilities to equity awards. Activity in equity classified share awards which relate to the 2006 Incentive Plan and the 2016 Incentive Plan during the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows:

  (All tables and balances are in thousands, except share data) 

Activity in liability classified share awards during the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

Compensation expenses for the Company associated with these awards totaled   $10,640   and   $8,038   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $21,982   and   $15,317   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , there was   $104,818   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share awards granted under the 2006 Incentive Plan and 2016 Incentive Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.63 years  . 
   
  (11) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  The fair values of the financial instruments represent the amounts that would be received to sell assets or that would be paid to transfer liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants as of a specified date. Fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs; however, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company s own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Those judgments are developed by the Company based on the best information available in the circumstances, including expected cash flows and appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates, as well as available observable and unobservable inputs. 
  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, unbilled work in process, receivables from affiliates, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred income approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. 
  The carrying value of the loan payable to affiliate, loans payable to former shareholders and an unsecured loan which is included in loan to non-affiliates, approximates fair value due to the variable interest rate borne by those instruments.   
   
  (12) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 
           (a) 
    Fram Shares 
     As described in note 10, the Company s former parent, Fram, granted compensatory restricted shares to certain employees of the Company under the 2006 Incentive Plan. Prior to the IPO, ORIX USA had the right, but not the obligation, to purchase shares to maintain its majority effective ownership of the Company and had purchased   $0   for both   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. As described in note 1, all Fram shares were converted to shares of the Company's Class B common stock in connection with the corporate reorganization that preceded the IPO.

In the opinion of the Company, in consultation with legal counsel, the final resolutions of these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, operations and cash flows. 
  Our obligation under the loan payable to affiliate is subordinated to our obligations under the revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. The scheduled aggregate repayments of the loan payable to affiliate, the loans payable to former shareholders, and the loan payable to non-affiliate are as follows: 

The Company also provides routine indemnifications relating to certain real estate (office) lease agreements under which it may be required to indemnify property owners for claims and other liabilities arising from the Company s use of the applicable

premises. In addition, the Company guarantees the performance of its subsidiaries under certain office lease agreements. The terms of these obligations vary, and because a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated, the Company has determined that it is not possible to make an estimate of the maximum amount that it could be obligated to pay under such contracts. Based on historical experience and evaluation of specific indemnities, management believes that judgments, if any, against the Company related to such matters are not likely to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any liability for these obligations as of   September 30, 2016   or March 31, 2016. 
  In addition, an acquisition made in December 2012 included contingent consideration with carrying value of   $0   and   $1,396   as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. An acquisition made in January 2015 included contingent consideration with a carrying value of   $2,543   and   $2,393  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and non-contingent consideration with a carrying value of   $3,139   and   $3,204  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , which are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  
  Straight-line rent expense under noncancelable operating lease arrangements and the related operating expenses were approximately   $6,473   and   $4,563   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $13,296   and   $9,028   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The approximate future minimum annual noncancelable rental commitments required under these agreements with initial terms in excess of one year are as follows: 

(14) SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION 
  The Company s reportable segments are described in note 1 and each are individually managed and provide separate services which require specialized expertise for the provision of those services. Revenues by segment represent fees earned on the various services offered within each segment.

Key Financial Measures 
  Fee Revenue 
  Fee revenue reflects revenues from our Corporate Finance, Financial Restructuring, and Financial Advisory Services business segments that substantially consist of fees for advisory services. 
  Revenue for all three business segments is recognized when earned and realizable. The amount and timing of the fees paid vary by the type of engagement. In general, advisory fees are paid at the time an engagement letter is signed ("Retainer Fees"), during the course of the engagement ( Progress Fees ), or upon the successful completion of a transaction or engagement ( Completion Fees ). Retainer Fees are generally recognized on a monthly basis, except in situations where there is uncertainty as to the timing of collection of the amount due. Progress Fees are recognized based on management s estimates of the relative proportion of services provided through the financial reporting date to the total services required to be performed. Completion Fees are recognized only upon substantial completion of the contingencies stipulated by the engagement agreement. In some cases, approval of our fees is required from the courts or other regulatory authority; in these circumstances, the recognition of revenue is often deferred until approval is granted. However, if the fee that is going to be collected from the client is fixed and determinable, and the collectability of the fee is reasonably assured, there are instances when revenue recognition prior to such approval is appropriate under GAAP. In instances when the revenue recognized on a specific engagement exceeds the amounts billed, unbilled work-in-process is recorded. Billed receivables are recorded as accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 2     included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a more detailed discussion. 
  Corporate Finance provides general financial advisory services in addition to advice on mergers and acquisitions and capital markets offerings. We advise public and private institutions on a wide variety of situations, including buy-side and sell-side transactions, as well as leveraged loans, private mezzanine debt, high-yield debt, initial public offerings, follow-ons, convertibles, equity private placements, private equity, and liability management transactions, and advise financial sponsors on all types of transactions. The majority of our Corporate Finance revenues consists of Completion Fees. A Corporate Finance transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons that are outside of our control. In these instances, our fees are generally limited to Retainer Fees and, in some cases fees, Progress Fees that may have been earned. 
  Financial Restructuring provides advice to debtors, creditors and other parties-in-interest in connection with recapitalization/deleveraging transactions implemented both through bankruptcy proceedings and though out-of-court exchanges, consent solicitations or other mechanisms, as well as in distressed mergers and acquisitions and capital markets activities. As part of these engagements, our Financial Restructuring business segment offers a wide range of advisory services to our clients, including: the structuring, negotiation, and confirmation of plans of reorganization; structuring and analysis of exchange offers; corporate  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

viability assessment; dispute resolution and expert testimony; and procuring debtor in possession financing. Although atypical, a Financial Restructuring transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons that are outside of our control. In these instances, our fees are generally limited to the initial Retainer Fees and/or Progress Fees. 
  Financial Advisory Services primarily provides valuations of various assets including: companies, illiquid debt and equity securities, and intellectual property (among other assets and liabilities). These valuations are used for financial reporting, tax reporting, and other purposes. In addition, our Financial Advisory Services business segment renders fairness opinions in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other transactions, and solvency opinions in connection with corporate spin-offs and dividend recapitalizations, and other types of financial opinions in connection with other transactions. Also, our Financial Advisory Services business segment provides dispute resolution services to clients where fees are usually based on the hourly rates of our financial professionals. Lastly, our Financial Advisory Services business segment provides strategic consulting services to clients where fees are either fixed or based on the hourly rates of our consulting professionals.  Unlike our Corporate Finance or Financial Restructuring segments, the fees generated in our Financial Advisory Services segment are generally not contingent on the successful completion of a transaction. 
  Operating Expenses 
  Our operating expenses are classified as employee compensation and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses; headcount is the primary driver of our operating expenses. Expenses are recorded on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, net of any expenses reimbursed by clients. 
  Employee Compensation Expenses.    Our employee compensation expenses, which account for the majority of our operating expenses, are determined by management based on revenues earned, headcount, the competitiveness of the prevailing labor market, and anticipated compensation expectations for our employees. These factors may fluctuate, and as a result, our employee compensation expenses may fluctuate materially in any particular period. Accordingly, the amount of employee compensation expenses recognized in any particular period may not be consistent with prior periods or indicative of future periods. 
  Our employee compensation expenses consist of base salary, payroll taxes, benefits, annual incentive compensation payable as cash bonus awards, deferred cash bonus awards, and the amortization of equity-based bonus awards. Base salary and benefits are paid ratably throughout the year. Our annual equity-based bonus awards include fixed share compensation awards and fixed dollar awards as a component of the annual bonus awards for certain employees. These equity awards are generally subject to annual vesting requirements over a three- or four-year period beginning at the date of grant, which occurs in the first quarter of each fiscal year; accordingly, expenses are amortized over the stated vesting period. In most circumstances, the unvested portion of these awards is subject to forfeiture should the employee depart from the Company. Cash bonuses, which are accrued monthly, are discretionary and dependent upon a number of factors including the Company's performance and are generally paid in the first quarter of each year with respect to prior year performance. Generally, a portion of the cash bonus is also deferred and paid in the third quarter of the next fiscal year. 
  In managing employee compensation and benefits expense, we focus on the following: (i) the ratio of our employee compensation and benefits to fee revenue ("Compensation Ratio"), (ii) the ratio of employee cash compensation and benefits plus deferred stock incentive employee compensation with respect to the applicable year to fee revenue ("Awarded Compensation Ratio") and, (iii) for periods commencing on October 1, 2015, the Awarded Compensation Ratio, excluding certain equity and cash grants awarded in connection with our IPO ( Adjusted Awarded Compensation Ratio ). We believe adjusted awarded employee compensation and benefits reflects the actual compensation cost more accurately than the GAAP measure of compensation cost, which includes applicable-period cash compensation and the amortization of deferred incentive compensation principally attributable to prior periods  deferred compensation.  We target an Adjusted Awarded Compensation Ratio of approximately 65% to 66%.  However, if we identify opportunities to grow fee revenue through significant expansion, to position our business during challenging market conditions for future growth or for other reasons, our Adjusted Awarded Compensation Ratio may increase to a level in excess of this target. 
  Non-Compensation Expenses.    The balance of our operating expenses includes costs for travel, meals and entertainment, rent, depreciation and amortization, information technology and communications, professional fees, other operating expenses and provision for bad debts. We refer to all of these expenses as non-compensation expenses. A portion of our non-compensation expenses fluctuate in response to changes in headcount. Reimbursed client expenses are netted against non-compensation expenses.  
  Other (Expenses) Income, net 
  Other (expenses) income, net includes (i) interest income earned on non-marketable securities, cash and cash equivalents, loans receivable from affiliates and employee loans, (ii) interest expense and/or gains or losses associated with our Revolving Credit Facility (defined herein), the loan payable to affiliate and loans payable to former shareholders, (iii) interest expense on the loan  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

payable to non-affiliate, (iv) equity income and/or gains or losses from funds and partnership interests where we have more than a minor ownership interest or more than minor influence over operations but do not have a controlling interest and are not the primary beneficiary, and (v) net income from investments in unconsolidated entities, which primarily represents the income associated with persons other than Houlihan Lokey that are our co-investors in a consolidated subsidiary that holds an equity method investment in an unconsolidated entity. 
   
  Results of Consolidated Operations 
  The following is a discussion of our results of operations for the three and   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the revenues and the operating expenses of our Corporate Finance, Financial Restructuring and Financial Advisory Services business segments in these periods, see Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q under the heading  Business Segments  below. 

NM = not meaningful 
    
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015 
  Fee revenue was   $186.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $158.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing an   increase   of   18%  . For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Corporate Finance revenues   increased     11%  , Financial Restructuring revenues   increased     39%   and Financial Advisory Services revenues   increased     7%  , compared with the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Operating expenses were   $151.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $140.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   8%  . Employee compensation and benefits expenses, as a component of operating expenses, were   $124.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $111.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   12%  . The   increase   in employee compensation and benefits expenses was primarily due to the growth in revenues for the quarter, partially offset by the change on October 1, 2015 from a revenue sharing model to a targeted Adjusted Awarded Compensation Ratio of between 65% and 66%. The Compensation Ratio was   67%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   70%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Non-compensation expenses, as a component of operating expenses, were   $26.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $29.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   10%  . The   decrease   in non-compensation expenses was primarily a result of second quarter fiscal 2016 costs that did not occur during the current period, primarily related to professional service and transaction expenses associated with our IPO, as well as corporate reorganization and related activities of $6.8 million. Acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets are a component of non-compensation expenses and were   $1.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   $0.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Other (expenses) income, net were   $(0.7) million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   $(0.3) million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in other (expenses) income, net was primarily a result of lower interest income generated on lower cash balances held by ORIX for the quarter.

The provision for income taxes for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $13.4 million  , which reflected an effective tax rate of   39.0%  . The provision for income taxes for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $7.8 million  , which reflected an effective tax rate of   45.9%  .  The   decrease   in the effective tax rate was primarily as a result of (i) the expected growth and improved profitability of our non-U.S. business in fiscal 2017 and (ii) a significant portion of the professional services fees associated with the IPO being non-tax deductible that only occurred for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Six Months Ended     September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015 
  Fee revenue was   $367.3 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $304.6 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing an   increase   of   21%  . For the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Corporate Finance revenues   increased     17%  , Financial Restructuring revenues   increased     42%   and Financial Advisory Services revenues   increased     3%  , compared with the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Operating expenses were   $299.5 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $263.4 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   14%  . Employee compensation and benefits expenses, as a component of operating expenses, were   $246.7 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $204.9 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   20%  . The   increase   in employee compensation and benefits expenses was primarily due to the growth in revenues for the year-to-date period.  The Compensation Ratio was   67%   for the both the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Non-compensation expenses, as a component of operating expenses, were   $52.8 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $58.5 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   10%  . The   decrease   in non-compensation expenses was primarily a result of year-to-date fiscal 2016 costs that did not occur during the current period, primarily related to professional service and transaction expenses associated with our IPO, as well as corporate reorganization and related activities of $12.8 million. Acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets are a component of non-compensation expenses and were   $2.0   million for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   $0.9   million for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Other (expenses) income, net were   $(1.7) million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   $1.0 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The change in other (expenses) income, net was primarily a result of (i) lower interest income generated on lower cash balances held by ORIX for the year-to-date period, (ii) increased interest expense associated with the Revolving Credit Facility (defined herein) and the ORIX Note (defined herein) that did not exist during the prior year-to-date period, and (iii) start-up losses associated with our Australian joint venture that was partially offset by our Italian joint venture income. 
  The provision for income taxes for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $25.9 million  , which reflected an effective tax rate of   39.1%  . The provision for income taxes for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $17.9 million  , which reflected an effective tax rate of   42.4%  .  The   decrease   in the effective tax rate was primarily as a result of (i) the expected growth and improved profitability of our non-U.S. business in fiscal 2017 and (ii) a significant portion of the professional services fees associated with the IPO being non-tax deductible that only occurred for the six months ended   September 30, 2015  .

CF closed   104   transactions in the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , versus   70   transactions in the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
   Segment profit for Corporate Finance was   $51.1 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $44.2 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Profitability   increased   primarily as a result of higher revenues.  
  Financial Restructuring 
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015 
  Revenues for Financial Restructuring were   $56.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $40.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing an   increase   of   39%  . The   increase   in revenues was primarily driven by a significant increase in the average transaction fee per closed transaction compared to the same quarter last year. FR closed   12   transactions in the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus   10   transactions in the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Segment profit for Financial Restructuring was   $14.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $10.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   30%  .  Profitability   increased   primarily as a result of higher revenues, which was partially offset by higher compensation expenses as a result of the vesting of pre-IPO grants that were only partially included in the same year-to-date period last year. 
  Six Months Ended     September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015 
  Revenues for Financial Restructuring were   $113.2 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $79.9 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing an   increase   of   42%  . The   increase   in revenues was primarily driven by a significant increase in the average transaction fee per closed transaction compared to the same year-to-date period last year. FR closed   22   transactions in the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus   21   transactions in the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Segment profit for Financial Restructuring was   $30.9 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $20.5 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   51%  .  The   increase   in profitability was a result of (i) the   increase   in revenues, and (ii) lower compensation expenses as a result of the change on October 1, 2015 to a targeted Adjusted Awarded Compensation Ratio of between 65% and 66%. 
  Financial Advisory Services 
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015 
  Revenues for Financial Advisory Services were   $29.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $27.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing an   increase   of   7%  . The   increase   in revenues was primarily a result of (i) stronger performance by our portfolio valuation and strategic consulting product lines, and (ii) increases in average project fees.  This increase was partially offset by a slowdown in the overall M A markets affecting the transaction based product lines, although improvement over the past three months has been experienced. FAS generated   437   fee events in the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , versus   467   fee events during the same quarter last year. 
  Segment profit for Financial Advisory Services was   $6.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $6.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   in profitability was primarily a result of an   increase   in revenues year-over-year partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses.  
  Six Months Ended     September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015 
  Revenues for Financial Advisory Services were   $57.9 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $56.4 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing an   increase   of   3%  . The   increase   in revenues was primarily a result of stronger performance by portfolio valuation and strategic consulting. This increase was partially offset by a

slowdown in the overall M A markets affecting the transaction based product lines.  FAS generated   701   fee events in the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , versus   663   fee events during the same year-to-date period last year. 
  Segment profit for Financial Advisory Services was   $13.3 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $13.1 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   in profitability was a result of the   increase   in revenues year-over-year, partially offset by higher compensation expenses as a result of the vesting of pre-IPO grants that were only partially included in the same year-to-date period last year, as well as higher non-compensation expenses.  
  Corporate Expenses 
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015 
  Corporate expenses were   $13.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $20.9 million   for   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing a   decrease   of   35%  . This   decrease   was primarily a result of second quarter fiscal 2016 costs that did not occur during the current period, primarily related to professional service and transaction expenses associated with our IPO, as well as corporate reorganization and related activities. 
  Six Months Ended     September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015 
  Corporate expenses were   $27.4 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $36.6 million   for   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing a   decrease   of   25%  . This   decrease   was primarily a result of year-to-date fiscal 2016 costs that did not occur during the current period, primarily related to professional service and transaction expenses associated with our IPO, as well as corporate reorganization and related activities. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our current assets comprise cash, a receivable from affiliates, income tax receivable, accounts receivable and unbilled work in process related to fees earned from providing advisory services. Our current liabilities include deferred income, accounts payable and accrued expenses, including accrued employee compensation expenses and current portion of loan obligations. 
  Our cash and cash equivalents include cash held at banks. We have not experienced any losses in our cash accounts. We maintain moderate levels of cash on hand in support of regulatory requirements for our registered broker-dealer. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $63 million   of cash in foreign subsidiaries. In August 2015, prior to the consummation of the IPO, we paid a dividend to our shareholders in connection with which the receivable from ORIX USA was repaid in full. A portion of the dividend was paid to ORIX USA in the form of a   $45.0 million   note (the "ORIX Note") that bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 165 basis points and is payable quarterly. Beginning on June 30, 2016, the Company began making required quarterly repayments of principal in the amount of $7.5 million, with the remaining principal amount due on the second anniversary of the completion of the IPO. Excess cash on hand in our U.K. subsidiary had been generally maintained in a receivable owned by ORIX Global Capital Ltd. ( OGC ), a U.K. subsidiary of ORIX Corporation (the  Cash Management Agreement ).  OGC paid interest to us under the Cash Management Agreement at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 165 basis points, calculated and payable monthly. In May 2016, ORIX notified the Company that it will no longer be accepting deposits under the agreement and repaid all outstanding amounts.  Currently, we are maintaining any excess cash in bank accounts. 
  On November 16, 2015, we issued the loan payable to non-affiliate in connection with the Leonardo transaction, which is a   14.0 million   Euro note bearing interest at an annual rate of 1.50% and is payable on November 16, 2040. Under certain circumstances, the note may be paid in part or in whole over a five year period in equal annual installments. 
  On May 18, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share of common stock, which was paid on June 15, 2016 to shareholders of record on June 3, 2016. 
  On July 27, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share of common stock, which was paid on September 15, 2016 to shareholders of record on September 2, 2016. 
  On November 1, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.17   per share of common stock, payable on December 15, 2016 to shareholders of record on December 5, 2016. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and March 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were   $156.1 million   and   $166.2 million  , respectively, and our loan receivable from OGC was   $0.0   and   $20.1 million  , respectively. 
  Our liquidity is highly dependent upon cash receipts from clients which in turn are generally dependent upon the successful completion of transactions as well as the timing of receivable collections, which typically occurs within 60 days of billing. As of   September 30, 2016   and March 31, 2016, net accounts receivables were   $45.7 million   and   $58.1 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and March 31, 2016, unbilled work in process was   $35.7 million   and   $51.3 million  , respectively.

We currently maintain a revolving line of credit pursuant to a loan agreement, dated as of August 18, 2015, by and among Houlihan Lokey, certain domestic subsidiaries of Houlihan Lokey party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., which provides for a revolving line of credit of   $75.0 million   that expires on August 18, 2017 (the  Revolving Credit Facility ).  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $0.0   outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility require payments of interest at the annual rate of LIBOR plus 1.00%. The loan agreement requires compliance with certain loan covenants including but not limited to the maintenance of minimum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of no less than $120 million as of the end of any quarterly 12-month period and certain leverage ratios including a consolidated leverage ratio of less than 1.50 to 1.00 and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than 1.25 to 1.00, as of the end of any quarterly 12-month period.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were and we expect to continue to be in compliance with such covenants. 
   
  Cash Flows 
  Our operating cash flows are primarily influenced by the amount and timing of receipt of advisory fees and the payment of operating expenses, including payments of incentive compensation to our employees. We pay a significant portion of our incentive compensation during the first and third quarters of each fiscal year.  A summary of our operating, investing, and financing cash flows is as follows: 

NM = not meaningful 
    
  Six Months Ended     September 30, 2016 
  Operating activities resulted in a net   inflow   of   $38.6 million   primarily attributable to (i) strong financial performance for the quarter driving increased net income, (ii) higher non-cash compensation expenses related to restricted share grants, and (iii) a decrease in net uncollected accounts receivable. Investing activities resulted in a net   inflow   of   $11.4 million   primarily attributable to decreases in receivables from affiliates in the U.K. to fund the bonus payments in the U.K., partially offset by capital expenditures. Financing activities resulted in a net   outflow   of   $56.9 million   primarily related to dividends paid, a pay down of our Revolving Credit Facility  and a principal payment on the ORIX note, and the repurchase of loans payable to former shareholders.  
  Six Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  Operating activities resulted in a net   outflow   of   $59.0 million  , primarily attributable to annual bonuses paid in April 2015. Investing activities resulted in a net   inflow   of   $164.7 million   primarily attributable to a decrease in receivables from affiliates as the receivable from ORIX USA was paid in full in conjunction with the payment of a pre-IPO dividend. Financing activities resulted in a net   outflow   of   $96.2 million   primarily related to dividend distributions.

Contractual Obligations 
  The aggregate amount which we are obligated to pay under Operating Leases for our office space has increased from the amount as of March 31, 2016.  At the end of our fiscal year, the amount due was   $146.4 million   and as of   September 30, 2016  , the amount due was   $151.8 million  .  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not invest in any off-balance sheet vehicles that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support, or engage in any activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our combined financial statements except for certain stand-by letters of credit and bank guarantees with Bank of America in support of various office leases totaling approximately $2.1 million. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period for which they are determined to be necessary. 
  There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. 
   
  Recent Accounting Developments 
  For a discussion of recently issued accounting developments and their impact or potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
   
  Item 3.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
   
  Market Risk and Credit Risk 
  Our business is not capital intensive and we generally do not issue debt or invest in derivative instruments. As a result, we are not subject to significant market risk (including interest rate risk) or credit risk (except in relation to receivables). We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings. Although these deposits are generally not insured, management believes we are not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held.  
    
  Our cash and cash equivalents are denominated in U.S. dollars, pound sterling, euros, Hong Kong dollars, Chinese yuan, and Japanese yen and we face foreign currency risk in our cash balances and other assets and liabilities held in accounts outside the United States due to potential currency movements and the associated foreign currency translation accounting requirements.  

28 

Table of Contents  

Risks Related to Cash and Short Term Investments 
  Our cash is maintained in United States and non-United States bank accounts. We have exposure to foreign exchange risks through all of our international affiliates. However, we believe our cash is not subject to any material interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk or other market risk. Consistent with our past practice, we expect to maintain our cash in bank accounts or highly liquid securities. 
   
  Exchange Rate Risk 
  The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the non-U.S. countries in which we operate may have an effect on the reported value of our non-U.S. dollar denominated or based assets and liabilities and, therefore, be reflected as a change in other comprehensive income. Our non-U.S. assets and liabilities that are sensitive to exchange rates consist primarily of trade payables and receivables, work in progress, and cash. During the six months ended   September 30, 2016  , the value of the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the pound sterling and euro, the primary currencies of our European operations. The net impact of the fluctuation of foreign currencies in other comprehensive income within the unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income was   $(6.2) million   for the six-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $(1.3) million   for the same period in 2015. 
  In addition, the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the currencies in the non-U.S. countries in which we operate and the United States dollar, affecting our operating results. We have analyzed our potential exposure to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the pound sterling and euro, the primary currencies of our European operations, by performing a sensitivity analysis on our net income, and determined that while our earnings are subject to fluctuations from changes in foreign currency rates, at this time we do not believe we face any material risk in this respect. 
  From time to time, we have entered into transactions to hedge our exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or other methods. In September 2016, we entered in to a foreign currency forward contract between the U.S. dollar and pound sterling with an aggregate notional value of   $3.0 million   and with a fair value representing a   gain   of   $0.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  A fluctuation in the value of this contract is intended to offset the changes in the value of a dollar denominated receivable held by our UK subsidiary.  We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of this foreign currency hedge assuming a 10% change in the pound sterling from the level as of September 30, 2016, with all other variables held constant. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of approximately $0.2 million in the fair value of this foreign currency forward contract. 
    
  In summary, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and the potential impact of future currency fluctuation will increase as our international expansion continues. The magnitude of this impact will depend on the timing and volume of revenues and expenses of, and the amounts of assets and liabilities in, our foreign subsidiaries along with the timing of changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the currencies of the non-U.S. countries in which we operate.   
   
  Credit Risk 
  We regularly review our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable and recoverable expense balances, and the current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay such amounts owed to us. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that, in our opinion, provides for an adequate reserve to cover losses that may be incurred.  
   
  Item 4.        Controls and Procedures 
  Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures  
  In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of   September 30, 2016  .   
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting performed during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II.    OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.        Legal Proceedings
