  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  Note 1. Basis of Presentation 
  The unaudited condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared by NZCH Corporation ( NZCH  or the  Company , formerly Zap.Com Corporation) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). The financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of such information. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, certain information and footnote disclosures, including a description of significant accounting policies normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ), have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by US GAAP. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC on March 9, 2016. The results of operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent periods or the entire fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
  On June 21, 2016, the Company sold its domain names, including the Zap.Com domain name, to a third party for   $375,000   (the  Domain Sale ). The Company recognized a gain on the Domain Sale for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .   The Company will utilize net operating losses to offset the tax effects on the gain on the Domain Sale and there was a release of previously recorded valuation allowance on the Company s deferred tax assets during the     nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Effective June 21, 2016, the Company also changed its name from Zap.Com Corporation to NZCH Corporation.  

Note 2. Related Party Transactions 
  Since its inception, the Company has utilized the services of the management and staff of HRG Group, Inc., its principal stockholder (the Company s  Principal Stockholder ), under a shared services agreement that allocated these costs on a percentage of time basis. The Company also shares office space with its Principal Stockholder under such agreement. Through   September 30, 2016  , the Principal Stockholder has waived its rights under the shared services agreement to be reimbursed for these costs. The Company recorded approximately   $7,250   and   $7,470   as contributed capital for such services for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $27,220   and   $26,578   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company believes these allocations were made on a reasonable basis; however, they do not necessarily represent the costs that would have been incurred by the Company on a stand-alone basis. 
  The Company s Principal Stockholder pays certain costs of being a public company on behalf of the Company and the corresponding payables are settled periodically. At   December 31, 2015  , the payable to the Principal Stockholder related to such transactions was   $5,802  . As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no payables to the Principal Stockholder with respect to such expenses.

Item 2.     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  This  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of NZCH Corporation (formerly Zap.Com Corporation, the  Company,   NZCH,   we,   us,  or  our ) should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed financial statements included elsewhere in this report and  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  Form 10-K ) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 9, 2016. Certain statements we make under this Item 2 constitute  forward-looking statements  under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See  Forward-Looking Statements  in  Part II   Other Information  of this report. You should consider our forward-looking statements in light of our unaudited condensed financial statements, related notes, and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report, our Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. 
  Overview 
  The Company was incorporated in Nevada in 1999 for the purpose of creating and operating a global network of independently owned web sites. HRG Group, Inc. (our  Principal Stockholder  or  HRG ) owns approximately 98% of our outstanding common stock. Currently, we have no business operations, other than complying with our reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While we may search for assets or businesses to acquire, we expect that we will in the future wind-down and/or liquidate our operations. 
  Results of Operations 
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our operations consisted of the following: 
  Revenues.   We had no revenues for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and we do not presently have any revenue-generating business. 
  Cost of Revenues  .   We had no cost of revenues for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  General and Administrative Expenses  .   General and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal and accounting professional services, printing and filing costs, expenses allocated for services by our Principal Stockholder under a shared services agreement, and various other costs. General and administrative expenses   decreased   by   $9,019   to   $19,943   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $28,962   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and   increased   by   $264   to   $128,986   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $128,722   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  Gain on Sale of Domain Names.   On June 21, 2016, the Company sold its domain names, including the Zap.Com domain name, to a third party for   $375,000   (the  Domain Sale ). The Company recognized a gain on the Domain Sale of   $375,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .   The Company will utilize net operating losses to offset the tax effects on the gain on the Domain Sale and there was a release of previously recorded valuation allowance on the Company s deferred tax assets during the     nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary source of liquidity has been from our initial capitalization and the Domain Sale. We have not generated any other significant revenue since our inception. At   September 30, 2016  , we held a cash balance of   $862,603  . 
  Since our inception, we have utilized services of the management and staff and occupied office space of our Principal Stockholder under a shared services agreement that allocated these costs. Our Principal Stockholder has waived its rights under the shared services agreement to be reimbursed these costs through   September 30, 2016  . For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded approximately   $7,250   and   $7,470  , respectively, as contributed capital for these services and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded approximately   $27,220   and   $26,578  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a cash balance of   $862,603   and owned certain other intangible assets to which we ascribe no value. We believe that we have sufficient resources to satisfy our existing liabilities and our anticipated operating expenses for the next twelve months. Until such time as we actively pursue a business combination, asset acquisition or liquidate our operations, we expect these expenses to consist mainly of general and administrative expenses incurred in connection with maintaining our status as a public reporting company. We have no commitments for capital expenditures and foresee none, except for possible future business combinations or asset acquisitions. In order to effect a business combination or asset acquisition, however, we may need additional financing. There is no assurance that any such financing will be available or available on terms favorable or acceptable to us. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements at   September 30, 2016   that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Summary of Cash Flows 
  Cash used for operating activities was   $107,911   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $137,078   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the timing of settlements of intercompany payables. 
  Cash provided by investing activities was   $375,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   related to the Domain Sale during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  We had no cash flows from financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  As of the date of this report, there are no recent accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted that we believe would have a material impact on our financial statements. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed materially from those set forth in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  We do not have any long-term debt obligations, capital leases obligations, operating lease obligations or purchase obligations at   September 30, 2016  . 

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  We do not have any market risk exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices or commodity prices at   September 30, 2016  . We had no outstanding derivative instruments or long-term debt at   September 30, 2016  . 

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
  An evaluation was performed under the supervision of the Company s management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer,  of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the  Exchange Act ) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
  Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
  An evaluation was performed under the supervision of the Company s management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of whether any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, concluded that no significant changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

     Table of Contents  

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
  Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures or the Company s internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 
  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE  SAFE HARBOR  PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. 
  NZCH Corporation (formerly Zap.Com Corporation, referred to as the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ) has made forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Generally, forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future actions, events or results of operations of our Company. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the information regarding our operations and management s plans for the Company. 
  Forward-looking statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words  may,   will,   believe,   expect,   anticipate,   intend,   plan,   estimate,   could,   might,  or  continue  or the negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology. We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for all forward-looking statements. 
  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. You should understand that the following important factors, in addition to those discussed in  Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 9, 2016 (the  Form 10-K ), could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. 
  Important factors that could affect our future results include, without limitation, the following: 

The impact of having no source of revenue; 
                
    The possibility that we might wind-down and/or liquidate our operations; 
                
    The controlling effect of HRG Group, Inc. (our  Principal Stockholder  or  HRG ) whose interests may conflict with interests of our other stockholders; 
                
    The impact of a determination that we are an investment company; 
                
    The impact of delays or difficulty in satisfying the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or negative reports concerning our internal controls; 
                
    The impact of management devoting insignificant time to our activities; 
                
    The impact of not, or not being able to, identify or successfully complete any business combination, acquisition or similar transaction, to the extent we decide to search for such opportunities; 
                
    The impact of significant competition for acquisition candidates and the structure of an acquisition or business combination on us or our stockholders, in each case to the extent we elect to pursue such a strategy; 
                
    The impact of our categorization as a  shell company  as that term is used in the SEC s rules; 
                
    The effect of a limited public market for our common stock on the trading activity and market value of our stock; 
                
    The potential liabilities or loss of benefits associated with being a member of our Principal Stockholder s consolidated tax group; 
                
    The effect of our intention not to pay any cash dividends on our common stock;  
                
    The effect of the anti-takeover provisions in our corporate documents on the market price of our common stock; and 
                
    The volatility of our common stock, including the effect of a substantial amount of our common stock being eligible for sale into the market on our stock price. 
     Some of the above-mentioned factors are described in further detail in the section entitled  Risk Factors  set forth in our Form 10-K. You should assume the information appearing in this report is accurate only as of   September 30, 2016   or as otherwise specified herein, as our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since that date. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the U.S. and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements.

Item 1A.     Risk Factors 
    
  When considering an investment in the Company, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in the Company s Form 10-K and last quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (together "Form 10-Qs"). Any of these risk factors could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations, and these risk factors are not the only risks that the Company may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that are not currently believed to be material also may adversely affect the Company. There have been no material changes in the Company s risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of the Form 10-K and Part II, Item IA, of our Form 10-Qs.
