NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS

Star Ally Inc. (formerly known as Reraise Gaming Corporation), (the  Company ) located in Las Vegas, Nevada, was incorporated on October 2, 2013, in the State of Nevada. As of September 30, 2016 the Company has acquired a variety of poker games, some with patents and some with patents pending, in addition to those we are developing. Each of the games has been acquired or is being developed for different segments of the poker market, namely video poker, brick and mortar, as well as online poker. Several of the games are available on line, at no charge, to test their viability.

Our former director Mr. Ron Camacho resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of our Company .   O n July 8, 2016 and Mr. Andy Kim was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer on the same date. Mr. Kim expressed that he will end the development and distribution of poker game and will shift focus to develop the binary option software, a financial software for the trading of binary option. A binary option, or asset-or-nothing option, is type of option in which the payoff is structured to be either a fixed amount of compensation if the option expires in the money, or nothing at all if the option expires out of the money. The success of a binary option is thus based on a yes or no proposition, hence  binary .  Our detailed plan of operation consists of developing the software, applying for patents and trademarks, apply for international patents and trademarks and market the software to the binary option industry.

On August 15, 2016, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Jung Choung Hun to a vacant position on the Company s Board of Directors. Jun Choung Hun was also appointed to the position of President, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Secretary, Treasurer and Executive Director, replacing Andy Kim, who resigned as President, CEO, Secretary and Treasurer. There was no disagreement between the Company and Andy Kim, and Mr. Kim retains his position as Director of the Company.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, contained in the Company's Form 10K, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein.  The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 

NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN

The accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, The Company has been engaged substantially in financing activities and developing its business plan and marketing. As a result, the Company incurred an accumulated deficit of $2,799,212. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's development activities since inception have been financially sustained through the sale of capital stock and capital contributions from a note holder.

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital from the sale of common stock or through debt financing and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating revenues. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

NOTE 4     COMMITMENT

On May 21, 2014 the Company entered into an agreement with Chris Moneymaker, an individual to use his name and likeness alongside a brief positive quote on the Company's website, paraphernalia or literature. In exchange, the Company will compensate Chris Moneymaker the following:

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

History and Overview

Star Ally Inc. was incorporated on October 2, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada.

Plan of Operations

We were in the business of developing software including gaming products (poker games)and after the appointment of Mr. Andy Kim as CEO of the Company on July 8, 2016, he inclined to terminate the development and distribution of poker game and will shift focus to develop the binary option software, a financial software for the trading of binary option. A binary option, or asset-or-nothing option, is type of option in which the payoff is structured to be either a fixed amount of compensation if the option expires in the money, or nothing at all if the option expires out of the money. The success of a binary option is thus based on a yes or no proposition, hence    binary .  Our detailed plan of operation consists of developing the software, applying for patents and trademarks, apply for international patents and trademarks and market the software to the binary option industry.

Results of Operations

The following is an analysis of our revenues, and analysis of components of expenses, and variances comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

We are in our infancy stage and have not generated any revenue from our core business model. Our total operating expenses during those periods were general and administrative expense of $25,765 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $73,558 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $500 compared to $631 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $25,765 compared to $33,158 for the same period in 2015.

The decrease in operating expenses, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, excluding the stock based compensation paid in 2015, is due, primarily, to reduced professional fees.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we utilized cash in the amount of $20,861 to pay for operating activities compared to $46,208 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included a net loss of $26,265 compared to a net loss of $74,189 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included amortization of intangible asset in the amount of $1,600 and a non-cash written back of loan and other payables, compared to amortization of $1,600 and a non-cash stock based compensation expense of $27,500, for the same nine months in 2015. Accounts and other payable increased and provided cash of $ 3  ,804  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash utilized of $1,119 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Investing Activities

We did not use any cash resources for investing activities during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

Financing Activities

We generate $9,210 from financing activities during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash generated from a related party loan and sale of common stock of $50,000 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.

Working Capital Needs : 

As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $7,306. Over the next 12 months, we will require approximately $75,000 to sustain our working capital needs as a public reporting company and to further develop our web and bricks and mortar products.

Sources of Capital:

We expect to obtain financing through the sale of restricted common shares, shareholder loans, and a potential line of credit. The sale of common shares will be priced based on current market activity. Shareholder loans, depending on circumstances, may be without stated terms of repayment or interest. Because a line of credit is not currently being investigated, its terms will depend on the lender at the time of commitment. We have no formal agreement that ensures that we will receive such loans. We may exhaust this source of funding at any time.

10 

Plan of Operations:

We are in the infancy stage of developing our products. The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 2, 2013, to engage in the development and distribution of poker games. We have generated no revenues from business operations. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion. This means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business unless we obtain additional capital to pay our ongoing operational costs. Accordingly, we must locate sources of capital to pay our operational costs.

Our former director Mr. Ron Camacho resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of our Company .    O n July 8, 2016 and Mr. Andy Kim was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer on the same date. Mr. Kim expressed that he will end the development and distribution of poker game and will shift focus to develop the binary option software, a financial software for the trading of binary option. A binary option, or asset-or-nothing option, is type of option in which the payoff is structured to be either a fixed amount of compensation if the option expires in the money, or nothing at all if the option expires out of the money. The success of a binary option is thus based on a yes or no proposition, hence  binary .  Our detailed plan of operation consists of developing the software, applying for patents and trademarks, apply for international patents and trademarks and market the software to the binary option industry.

On August 15, 2016, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Jung Choung Hun to a vacant position on the Company s Board of Directors. Jun Choung Hun was also appointed to the position of President, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Secretary, Treasurer and Executive Director, replacing Andy Kim, who resigned as President, CEO, Secretary and Treasurer. There was no disagreement between the Company and Andy Kim, and Mr. Kim retains his position as Director of the Company.

Material Commitments

We do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.

Seasonal Aspects

Management is not currently aware of any seasonal aspects which would affect the results of our operations during any particular time of year.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off balance sheet arrangements.

Going Concern

We anticipate that additional funding will be required in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. At this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or through a loan from our directors to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future debt or equity financing.

ITEM 3.           QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.

ITEM 4.           CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective  as of  September 30, 2016.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
