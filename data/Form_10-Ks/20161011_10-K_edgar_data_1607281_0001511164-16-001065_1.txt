 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
   
 This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as  may,   will,   expect,   believe,   anticipate,   estimate,   approximate  or  continue,  or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 
   
 Business in general 
   
 Elite Group Inc. (the  Company ) was formed in the State of Nevada on May 21, 2013. Our initial business intention was to sell books utilizing internet, and grow customer base by selling unique editions of books. On January 26, 2016, as a result of a private transaction, whereby 2,000,000 shares of common stock, has been cancelled by the former CEO and 2,020,000 shares of common stock have been issued to Terrence Tecco, a change of control of the Company occurred.  
   
 On July 22, 2016, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation that had the effect of changing the name of the corporation to Elite Group, Inc. (previously Elite Books, Inc.) and designating 74,000,000 shares of the authorized capital stock of the Company as common stock, par value $0.001 and 1,000,000 shares of the authorized capital stock of the Company as preferred stock, par value $0.001, with the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions designated by the Company s board of directors. 
   
 Upon the change of control of the Company, the existing director and officer resigned and the number of directors constituting the board of directors of the Company was set at three (3). Brad Fretti, Michael Fasci and Terrence Tecco assumed the role of directors of the Company. Terrence Tecco was appointed as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Brad Fretti was appointed as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Fretti resigned from the board and Chief Financial Officer position on May 6, 2016. 
    
 General strategy 
   
  The Company plans to acquire water properties for the oilfield service sector. Management specializes in the acquisition of assets relating to the management of oilfield water used in upstream oil and gas operations. Management's objective is to acquire and consolidate water processing assets in prolific oil and gas exploration areas. Management believes it will accomplish its goal to maximize shareholder value through strategic acquisitions, effective business model design and economies of scale to a fragmented industry. The Company will control the entire process from wellhead to the final destination and use the most environmental friendly practices in all aspects of our operations to protect and conserve the environment for future generations.

   Mammoth Corporation Convertible Debenture Agreement   
   
  On July 29, 2016, the Company entered into a convertible note payable with Mammoth Corporation. The $27,500 note payable includes $6,000 of original issuance discount. The note is due upon the Company closing a debt or equity transaction in excess of $100,000 and no further interest shall accrue as long as the note is not in default. Default rate is 18% per annum interest. The note is collateralized by the issuance of 300,000 shares of the Company common stock issued on August 2, 2016.   
   
  Our Properties  
   
  The Company holds  one Salt Water Disposal(Kypo)  property in oil and gas land located in Carrizo Springs, Texas, acquired on August 17, 2015, pursuant to Lease Agreement dated the same. 
   
   Oil and Gas Industry-Specific Disclosures   
   
 As described in greater detail above, the Company has only recently begun its oil and gas business operations. Accordingly, the disclosure required by Subpart 1200 of Regulation S-K (Section 229.1200 of this chapter) is not applicable to our Company as of the date hereof. The Company has obtained Leases in the Eagle Ford Formation in South Texas consisting of 675 gross acres of undeveloped acreage. 

5 

Competition  
   
 The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. Our competition is comprised of junior and senior oil and gas companies, including several oil and gas companies that are listed on national exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, independent producers and institutional and individual investors. We will compete with these parties to, among other things: 

acquire oil and gas properties, or leases for such properties, in the United States; 

rent or purchase equipment needed to process water disposal. 

hire, as consultants or as full time employees, persons with the technical know-how to explore oil and gas properties and to extract oil and gas from such properties; 

obtain equity and debt financing from investors; and 

acquire other materials necessary to operate on these properties.  

As a start-up company that has only recently begun implementing our business plan, many of the oil and gas companies with which we will compete with have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring oil and gas interests of merit or on exploring or developing their oil and gas properties. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire oil and gas properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and development. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further oil and gas interests or explore and develop our current or future oil and gas properties.  
   
  Government Regulation  
   
  The Company has only recently begun implementing its business plan and has not yet begun the exploration of the Texas Properties. Once the Company commences exploration and exploitation activities on the Texas Properties or any other property, the Company will become subject to a wide range of laws and regulations. Virtually all aspects of the oil and gas industry are subject to a vast array of federal and state laws and regulations. Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. It may be expected that in the future, new laws and regulations will be adopted that will limit certain operations and/or increase the costs of such operations. These laws and regulations either presently require or in the future may require, among other things: 

acquiring various permits before drilling commences; 

enjoining some or all of the operations of facilities deemed not in compliance with permits; 

restricting the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and gas and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities; 

limiting or prohibiting drilling activities in certain locations lying within protected or otherwise sensitive areas; and 

requiring remedial measures to mitigate pollution from our operations. 

6 

All of our planned operations involving the exploration for and extraction of gas and oil will be subject to existing laws and regulations relating to exploration procedures, safety precautions, employee health and safety, air quality standards, pollution of stream and fresh water sources, odor, noise, dust, and other environmental protection controls adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as the right of adjoining property owners. We may be required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or extraction of oil and/or gas may have upon the environment. All requirements imposed by any such authorities may be costly, time consuming, and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or extraction operations. In conducting our business plan, we may become subject to certain of the rules and regulations promulgated under each of the following: 

Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended; 

Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947, as amended; 

Oil and Gas Pollution Act of 1990, as amended;  

Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended; 

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended; 

Clean Air Act of 1963, as amended; and 

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. 

Compliance with these laws can be costly; the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased significantly in recent years, notwithstanding the widely recognized public demand for  energy independence.  No assurance can be given that compliance with these laws or with newly imposed or changed laws will not adversely affect the economic viability of any oil and gas properties we may acquire in the future. 
   
   Intellectual Property  
   
 We do not own or license any material intellectual property in connection with the operation of our business. 
   
  Employees  
   
  As of March 31, 2016, we had one full time (1) employee. Any site work is handled by contract labor.     Our Chief Executive Officer s business experiences are described in the section entitled  Management.      
   
  How to Obtain our SEC Filings  
   
   We file annual, quarterly, and special reports, proxy statements, and other information with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Reports, proxy statements and other information filed with the SEC can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities of the SEC at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, DC 20549. Such material may also be accessed electronically by means of the SEC s website at www.sec.gov.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
  To the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of Elite Group, Inc  
  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Elite Group, Inc (f/k/a Elite Books, Inc.) as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders  deficit, and cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. Elite Group Inc. s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.    
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Elite Group, Inc as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company had accumulated deficit of $15,824,577 as of March 31, 2016, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

  Notes To The Audited Financial Statements  
  For the Year Ended March 31, 2016  
   
  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS  
   
 Elite Books Inc. is a corporation registered in the State of Nevada on May 21, 2013. We are a company at its development stage. Our business intention is to sell books utilizing internet, and grow customer base by selling unique editions of books. Our revenue is earned by charging a fee to our customers who are interested in our product. 
   
 On July 22, 2016, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the  Amended and Restated Articles ) that had the effect of changing the name of the corporation to Elite Group, Inc. and designating 74,000,000 shares of the authorized capital stock of the Company as common stock, par value $0.001 and 1,000,000 shares of the authorized capital stock of the Company as preferred stock, par value $0.001, with the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions designated by the Company s board of directors. 
   
  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
   Basis of Presentation   
   
 The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. 
   
   Accounting Basis   
   
 The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP  accounting). The Company has adopted a calendar year end. 
   
   Cash and Cash Equivalents   
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  
   
   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
   
 The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company s promissory note obligations approximate fair value, as the terms of these notes are consistent with terms available in the market for instruments with similar risk. 
   
 We account for our derivative financial instruments, consisting solely of certain stock purchase warrants that contain non-standard anti-dilutions provisions and/or cash settlement features, and certain conversion options embedded in our convertible instruments, at fair value using level 3 inputs. We determine the fair value of these derivative liabilities using the Black-Scholes option pricing model when appropriate, and in certain circumstances using binomial lattice models or other accepted valuation practices. 

F-6 

When determining the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, we are required to use various estimates and unobservable inputs, including, among other things, contractual terms of the instruments, expected volatility of our stock price, expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate. Changes in any of the assumptions related to the unobservable inputs identified above may change the fair value of the instrument. Increases in expected term, anticipated volatility and expected dividends generally result in increases in fair value, while decreases in the unobservable inputs generally result in decreases in fair value. 
   
   Income Taxes   
   
 Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. 
   
   Use of Estimates   
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
   Revenue Recognition   
   
 Revenue will be recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned.  Specifically, revenue will be recognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) Service has occurred, customer acceptance has been achieved; (3) Our selling price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and (4) Collection is reasonably assured.  The Company recognizes revenue when services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured. 
   
   Stock-Based Compensation   
   
 Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. 
   
   Basic Income (Loss) Per Share   
   
 Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common share equivalents outstanding as of March 31, 2016. 
   
   Comprehensive Income   
   
 The Company has established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. When applicable, the Company would disclose this information on its Statement of Shareholders  Equity. Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company has not had any significant transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive income.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 In February 2016, FASB issued ASU-2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).   The guidance requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right of use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For finance leases: the right-of-use asset and a lease liability will be initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position; interest on the lease liability will be recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income; and repayments of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified within financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability and variable lease payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. For operating leases: the right-of-use asset and a lease liability will be initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position; a single lease cost will be recognized, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis; and all cash payments will be classified within operating activities in the statement of cash flows.   Under Topic 842 the accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous GAAP. The amendments in Topic 842 are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019, including interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance of the consolidated financial statements. 
   
 In January 2016, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board ( FASB ),  issued Accounting  Standards Update ( ASU )  2016-01,   Financial  Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition  and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on the classification  and measurement  of financial instruments.  Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.  In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and are to be adopted by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. 
   
 In  November  2015,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2015-17,   Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Balance  Sheet  Classification   of  Deferred  Taxes,   which  simplifies  the presentation  of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities  and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 16, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this standard will not have any impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and disclosures. 
   
  NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN  
   
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. 
   
 Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
   
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs.  Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.   Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
   
  CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS  
   
 The Company plans to concentrate its development efforts in the Eagle Ford Formation in South Texas.  We believe such opportunities exist in the United States with the recent improvements in water disposal. We have only recently begun our planned business operations. To date our operations have primarily been devoted to forming the entity and developing our business plan. We have several properties under contract and have completed most of the financing for these acquisitions. 
   
 The following table provides selected financial data about us for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015. For detailed financial information, see the audited Financial Statements included in this report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
   
 We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 
   
 We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. 
   
 FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2016 COMPARED TO MARCH 31, 2015. 
   
 Our net loss for the year ended March 31, 2016 was $15,795,965 compared to a net loss of $27,196, during the year ended March 31, 2015. Our loss was attributable to financing and administrative costs and professional fees incurred compared to nominal business activity in the prior year.  
   
 This change in net loss was primarily the result of the following: 
   
  Revenue  
   
 We recognized $200 of revenue during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $930 of revenue during the year ended March 31, 2015.  The decrease in revenue of $730 was attributable to limited resources to maintain revenue. 
   
  Operating expenses  
   
 We incurred operating expenses of $15,342,056 during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $28,126 of operating expenses during the year ended March 31, 2015. The primary expense in the year ended March 31, 2016 was $15,200,000 of employee stock based compensation attributable to 20 million shares due to our Chief Executive Officer in accordance with an employment agreement dated January 26, 2016. Our operating expenses also consisted of general and administrative fees of $45,206 compared to $28,126 in the year ended March 31, 2015 related to office, compliance and professional fees. Furthermore, we incurred expense of $93,750 for stock issuances for professional and advisory services during the year ended March 31, 2016. 
   
  Other Income (Expense)  
   
 We incurred interest expense of $23,833 and financing costs of $36,463 related to our convertible debenture in the year ended March 31, 2016. Furthermore, the Company into an advisory services agreement with TCA Global Master Fund for investment banking services. The Company shall issue $250,000 in the form of restricted shares of the Company common stock. The issuance of shares are subject to an anti-dilution share issuances to the extent the cash proceeds from the share issuances are inadequate to satisfy the $250,000 fee. The Company issued 139,750 shares of common stock at closing valued at a price equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of the average of the lowest daily volume weighted average price of the Common Stock during the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the agreement date. As of March 31, 2016, an additional issuance of 189,227 shares with a fair market value of $143,813 are required to satisfied the advisory agreement whereby an additional financing costs has been recorded to common stock payable.  The Company recorded $393,813 of stock-based financing costs for the year ended March 31, 2016.  
   
  Net Losses  
   
 Our net loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016   was $15,795,965 compared to a net loss of $27,196 during the year ended March 31, 2015 due to the factors discussed above.    

13 

Weighted average number of shares  
   
 The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 2,848,859 and 2,031,438 for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The weighted average number of shares is an average calculation incorporating changes to the shares outstanding within the period reported. 
   
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
   
  Year Ended March 31, 2016 Compared with Year Ended March 31, 2015  
   
 As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $17 and $2,888 of cash and cash equivalents.  
   
 We have experienced losses of $15,795,965 and $27,196 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and have an accumulated deficit of $15,824,577 at March 31, 2016. In addition, we have not completed our efforts to establish a stable recurring source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and expect to continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future. There is no assurances that we will be able to obtain an adequate level of financing needed for our near term requirements or the long-term development and exploration of our leases. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a  going concern . 
   
 The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and, or, the private placement of  convertible debt and/or issuance of common stock.   
   
 Because of the Company s history of losses, its independent auditors, in the reports on the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that could result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
   
 Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern. 
   
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  
   
 We have generated negative cash flows from operating activities. For the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $16,345 consisting of a net loss of $15,795,965, offset by non-cash stock compensation of $15,687,563 and amortization of financing costs of $34,963, an increase of $18,261 in accounts payables and accrued liabilities, an increase of $15,000 of accrued officer salary and an increase of $23,833 in accrued interest payable. For the year ended March 31, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities was $27,196 consisting of a net loss of $27,196.  
   
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  
   
 We neither used nor generated cash from investing activities.   

14 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities  
   
 We have financed our operations primarily from the issuance of convertible debt, sale of shares of our common stock or by way of loan from our shareholders. We generated cash from financing activities of $13,474 and $23,400 in the year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $12,680 of net proceeds from the issuance of a $500,000 convertible debenture and $794 from advances from shareholders. 
   
 PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 
   
 We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business 
   
 Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to the acquisition of assets. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 
   
 MATERIAL COMMITMENTS 
   
 As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments. 
   
 GOING CONCERN 
   
 The independent auditors' audit report accompanying our March 31, 2016 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared  assuming that we will continue as a going concern,  which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 
   
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARANGEMENTS 
   
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
   
 SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.  Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.  A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. 

15 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.  
     
 We do not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our net results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

   Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
   
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016 using the criteria established in  Internal Control - Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ). 
   
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 
   
 1. 
 We do not have an Audit Committee   While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 
   
 2. 
 We did not have appropriate policies and procedures in place to evaluate the proper accounting and disclosures of key documents and agreements.  
   
 3. 
 We did not maintain appropriate cash controls   As of March 31, 2016, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts. 
   
 4. 
  We did not implement appropriate information technology controls   As at March 31, 2016, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. 

17 

Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 
   
 As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 
   
   System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
   
 Although our Company is unable to meet the standards under COSO because of the limited funds available to a company of our size and stage of development, we are committed to improving our financial organization. As funds become available, we will undertake to: (1) create a position to  segregate duties consistent with control objectives, (2) increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function (3) appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of our Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and (4) prepare and implement sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 
   
 We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.  However, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. 
   
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
   
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016, that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s  report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.

          2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
   
          3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
   
          4. I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
   
       a.  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures, to be designed under my supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
   
       b.  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under my supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
   
       c.  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
   
       d.  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal year (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
   
          5. I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
   
          a.  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
   
          b.  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
