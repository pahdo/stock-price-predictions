   (UNAUDITED)   

NOTE
1.    

    Nature
of Operations  :  

  GeneSYS
ID Inc. (Formerly known as Rx Safes, Inc.) ( the Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada
on June 1, 2010. The Company   designs, develop and manufactures innovative biometric
products and systems that offer secure storage, access control, drug delivery and remote patient monitoring and medication adherence
solutions in both home and professional environments as well as within healthcare facilities, improving security, safety, levels
of patient care and employee accountability.  

  On
June 28, 2016, the Company formed subsidiaries named GeneSYS ID, INC. with 100,000,000 authorized shares of capital stock, $0.001
par value per share, and GeneSYS RX, INC. also with 100,000,000 authorized shares of capital stock, $0.001 par value per share.
These subsidiaries had no business transactions prior to June 30, 2016 other than incorporating.  

On
July 8, 2016 the Company entered into an agreement to purchase 100% of the membership interests of My Touch ID, LLC from its members
Glenn McGinnis and Scott McGinnis, who each owned 50% of My Touch ID, LLC., for $125,000 payable in 357,143 shares of Company
stock (based on the closing price of the Company s stock on July 8, 2016 at $0.35 per share).  

In
addition, the Company agreed to pay to Sellers the following  Earn Out  as follows: 2.5% of any revenues up to a cap
of $1,000,000 generated from the assets acquired and held in My TOUCH  and 0.5% of any revenues above $1,000,000 up to a
cap of $5,000,000 generated from the assets acquired and held in My TOUCH. The Earn Out is payable in cash, common stock of the
Company or a combination thereof, in the sole discretion of Sellers.  

Under
the Purchase Agreement, the Company is responsible for $2,500 in unpaid debts in My TOUCH and the Sellers were required to discharge
all debt beyond that amount before the July 8, 2016 Closing Date.  

On
July 18, 2016, Rx Safes, Inc. (the  Company ) entered into a Contribution Agreement (the  Agreement )
with GeneSYS-RX, Inc. (the  Subsidiary ), a Nevada corporation, pursuant to which the Company contributed certain
assets and liabilities to the Subsidiary in exchange for 5,000,000 shares of common stock in the Subsidiary. The assets excluded
all patents, designs, patent applications and trademarks currently owned by the Company as of the closing of the transfer. 
In addition, all variable rate convertible notes remained with the Company.  

On
July 20, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of Nevada in order to effectuate a merger with
its wholly owned subsidiary, GeneSYS ID, Inc.  Shareholder approval was not required under Section 92A.180 of the Nevada
Revised Statutes. As part of the merger, the Company s board of directors authorized a change in the Company s name
to  GeneSYS ID, Inc.  and the Company s Articles of Incorporation have been amended to reflect this name change.  

On
July 20, 2016, the Company formed a subsidiary named bioHEALTHMED, Inc., with 5,000,000 at $0.0001 par value authorized shares
of voting common stock.  

On
July 29, 2016, FINRA announced the name/symbol change of  RX Safes, Inc.  (RXSF) to  GeneSYS ID, Inc. 
its Daily List and this change took effect at the open of business on August 1, 2016.  The new symbol for GeneSYS ID, Inc.
is GNID.  

Table of Contents     

Principles
of consolidation and Basis of Presentation    

The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. For the three months and none months ended September 30, 2016 the results of operations
of companies purchased are included from the dates of acquisition.  

  Interim
reporting:  

  The
interim condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S.
GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures made
are adequate to provide for fair presentation and a reasonable understanding of the information presented. The Interim Condensed
Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included
in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes, for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, previously filed with the SEC.  

  In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement
of financial position as of September 30, 2016, results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, have been made. The results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal
year or any future periods.  

  NOTE
2.  

    Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies  :  

  The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared using U.S. GAAP that are applicable to a going concern which contemplates
that the Company will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its
liabilities in the normal course of business.  

Management s
use of estimates    

  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  

    Cash
and cash equivalents    

  Cash
and cash equivalents include funds on hand and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash deposits
are insured in limited amounts by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  

    Accounts
receivable    

  Customer
accounts receivable consist of amounts owed from private individuals or organizations for product delivered. The Company provides
an allowance for doubtful collections, which is based upon a review of outstanding receivables, historical collection information,
and existing economic conditions. Normal receivable are due 30 days after the issuance of the invoice. Receivables past due more
than 120 days are considered delinquent. Delinquent receivables are written off based on individual credit evaluation and specific
circumstances of the customer.  

Table of Contents     

Inventories    

  Inventories
consist of safes and brackets. All inventories are valued at lower of average cost or market. The company periodically reviews
inventories and items considered obsolete or outdated are reduced to their estimated net realizable value.  

  The
components of inventory as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are valued as follows:  

Property
and Equipment and Depreciation    

  Property
and Equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded based on the estimated lives of the assets. Depreciation expense
was $-0- for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

    Shipping
and Handling Freight Fees and Costs    

  All
amounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction related to shipping and handling represent revenues earned and are reported
as revenue. The costs incurred by the Company for shipping and handling are reported as part of cost of goods sold.  

    Revenue
recognition    

  Revenue
is recognized when the four criteria for revenue recognition are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) shipment
or delivery has occurred; (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company has
recognized revenue associated with its mission as stated above in the nature of operations footnote. Sales to customers are recorded
when the goods are shipped to the customer. Sales are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the accompanying
statements of income. Allowances for returns are estimated based on historical customer return rates. The Company has not had
any product returns since inception. Customers pre-pay for orders though a website with their credit cards prior to the shipment
of the goods, which takes place within a few days after the order is placed.  

    Advertising
expense    

  The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense charged to operating expenses was $1,688 and $10,588 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

    Rent
expense    

  The
Company pays rent on a month-to-month basis. Rent expense charged to operating expenses was $5,791 and $5,195 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.       

Table of Contents     

Intangible
assets    

  Intangible
assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized over their expected life. Currently the Company owns
a patent which it amortizes over its remaining life.  

    Research
and development costs    

  Research
and development costs, consisting primarily of expenditures paid to our manufacturing and development partner in China, are expensed
as incurred. Research and development expense charged to operating expenses was $11,982 and $2,442 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

    Fair
value measurements    

  U.S.
GAAP requires disclosing the fair value of financial instruments to the extent practicable for financial instruments which are
recognized or unrecognized in the balance sheet. The fair value of the financial instruments disclosed herein is not necessarily
representative of the amount that could be realized or settled, nor does the fair value amount consider the tax consequences of
realization or settlement.  

  In
assessing the fair value of financial instruments, the Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions, which are based on estimates
of market conditions and risks existing at the time. For certain instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, and accrued expenses, it was estimated that the carrying amount approximated fair value because of the short
maturities of these instruments. All debt is based on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining
maturities and approximates fair value.  

  GAAP
establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the
use on unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent
of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the assumptions market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy
is described below:  

  Level
1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.  

  Level
2:  Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data.  

  Level
3:  Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest
priority to Level 3 inputs.  

  Determining
which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. We evaluate our hierarchy disclosures
each quarter

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

  On
May 1, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  which is the new comprehensive
revenue recognition standard that will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The standard s core
principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective
for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. Entities will have
the option of using either a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the guidance in the ASU. The Company
will continue to assess the impact on its financial statements.  

  In
June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments
When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.  This
ASU provides more explicit guidance for treating share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects
vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition. The new guidance is effective
for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance
to have a material impact on the financial statements.   

  On
June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities
(Topic 915). Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity from Topic
915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US GAAP. In addition,
the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information on the statements
of income, cash flows and shareholder s equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity;
(3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose in the first year
in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The amendments
are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and interim reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements
have yet to be issued. The Company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial
statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented inception-to-date information on the respective financial
statements.  

   In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Topic 205-40) ,
which requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going
concern for each annual and interim reporting period. If substantial doubt exists, additional disclosure is required. This new
standard will be effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company expects to adopt this new standard for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 and the Company will continue
to assess the impact on its financial statements

Income
Taxes    

  The
Company provides for income taxes under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic No. 740,
 Income Taxes , which requires that an asset and liability based approach be used in accounting for income taxes.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of the temporary differences
of revenue and expense items for financial statement and income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are provided against assets,
which are not likely to be realized.  

    Stock-based
Compensation    

  The
Company adopted ASC 718,  Compensation - Stock Compensation  for stock-based compensation. ASC 718 requires that the
fair value of the equity instruments (such as stock options) exchanged for services be recognized as an expense in the financial
statements as the related services are performed.  

  Earnings
Per Share  

  Earnings
per share ( EPS ) has been calculated in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share  which requires the
presentation of both basic net income per share and net income per common share assuming dilution. Basic earnings per share are
computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year.
Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur upon the exercise of common stock options resulting
in the issuance of common stock to stockholders who would then share in the earnings of the Company. ASC 260 precludes the inclusion
of any potential common shares in the computation of any diluted per-share amounts when such inclusion is anti-dilutive.  

  NOTE
3.     

    License
Agreements    

  Included
in the assets purchased from Axius Consulting Group, Inc. was a Patent   Licensing Rights Agreement with bioMETRX. The agreement
grants the licensee a royalty based, ($.50 per unit) exclusive license under their Patent License to use, manufacture, have manufactured,
license and/or sell licensed intellectual property for any legal purpose with North America within the health care and consumer
markets. The term of the agreement is from the effective date (March 1, 2009) to the full end of the term or terms for which Patent
Rights have not expired or, if only Technology Rights are licensed and no Patent Rights are applicable, for a term of 9 years.  

  On
November 11, 2015, the Company entered into a binding letter of intent to purchase all right, title and interest to patent number
7,806,852. The Company will pay to the seller 83,334 shares of the Company s common stock. The Company shall pay the seller
$1.5 per unit on sales of current product as well as $3.00 per unit on sales of new devices incorporating the patented encasement.
If the Company sells a majority interest or there is a change in management from the original founders, the seller has the option
to continue the royalty agreement or take a one-time $250,000 cash payout and waive future rights. On February 2, 2016 the Company
entered into a definitive agreement with Philip Jurson MD and Steven F. Borsand. The agreement memorialized the terms set forth
in the binding letter of intent executed on November 11, 2015 for the purchase of USPTO patent number 7,806,852  

In
the previous quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Company authorized the issuance of the shares and recorded the Patent as an Intangible
Asset in the interim financial information.

On
January 11, 2016 the Company entered in an Intellectual Property Licensing agreement with Talon Brands, LLC. Under this agreement
Talon Brands is responsible to pay a fee equivalent to $2.50 per unit sold in perpetuity unless or until the parties agree in
writing to modify, enter into a new agreement or terminate the agreement. As a result of the acquisition of 100% of the membership
interests of My TOUCH ID, LLC, (formerly Talon Brands, LLC.,) by the Company executed on July 8, 2016, all obligations under the
prior licensing agreement were terminated.  

NOTE
4.  

    Income
Taxes    

  As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $39,951,000 that may be available to
reduce future years  taxable income in varying amounts through 2031. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of
these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and
accordingly, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.  

  The
Company reviews tax positions taken to determine if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination
resulting in an uncertain tax position. The Company did not have any material unrecognized tax benefit at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in

Agreement    

The President of the Company, Ms. Lorraine Yarde, signed an employment contract effective January 1, 2015 which is effective until
termination. The agreement stipulates a base salary of $175,000 plus an annual performance bonus targeted at fifty percent of
salary. The agreement entitles Ms. Yarde to annual salary increases of ten percent as well as other customary employee benefits
such as paid vacation and eligibility to participate in the Company s health insurance plan or reimbursement of up to $1,000
per month until a company-health insurance plan is established. The agreement allows Ms. Yarde to convert any unpaid compensation
to Company stock at a 50% discount to the then market price, in the form of unregistered securities.  

On
September 18, 2015, the employment contract was amended to re-price the exercise price on her 50,000 options from $0.25 to $0.001
per share resulting in additional estimated fair value of the stock options of $564,975 recognized as compensation expense (calculated
using the Black Scholes option pricing model). In addition, the calculation of the exercise price which was exercisable at 50%
of the trading price of the common shares was amended to apply the 50% discount to the lowest trading price of the Company s
common stock as reported on the OTCQB for the ten prior trading days including the day upon which a notice of conversion is received
by the Company. Amendment for the ten day period resulted in an increase in the fair value of the options from $.23 to $.25 applied
per exercisable share.  

On
September 21, 2015, Ms. Yarde converted $87,500 of the unpaid compensation into 265,152 shares of the Company s common stock.

The
company identified embedded derivatives related to the EMA, Auctus Fund LLC, Kodiak, Yoshar, Adar, APG, Black Mountain and Crownbridge
Convertible Promissory Notes. These embedded derivatives included certain conversion features. The accounting treatment of derivative
financial instruments requires that the company record the fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date of the Convertible
Promissory Note and to adjust the fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Under ASC-815, the conversion options embedded
in the notes payable described in Note 8 require derivate liability classification because they do not contain an explicit limit
to the number of shares that could be issued upon settlement.  

  As
defined in FASB ASC 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilized the market data of
similar entities in its industry or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including
assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable,
market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those
inputs. FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).  

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  

Level
1   Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets
are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives, marketable securities
and listed equities.  

Level
2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1, which are either directly or indirectly
observable as of the reported date.  

Level
3 - Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used
with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value.  

Derivative
liability   the Company s derivative liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  

The
following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the Company s financial assets and liabilities that
were accounted for at fair value as at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

(c)
Convertible in shares of common stock 70% of the lowest closing for the twenty days trading immediately preceding the date of

    Going
Concern    

  The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company
as a going concern. However, the Company had minimal revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company
currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient
to cover operating costs over an extended period of time.  

  Management
anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses.
The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light
of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or
become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

  On
March 5, 2015, Wall Street Buy Sell Hold filed a lawsuit against the Company in New York alleging breach of a consulting agreement
between the parties. On March 10, 2015 the company filed a lawsuit against Wall Street Buy Hold Sell in Nevada. The suit claims
WSBHS engaged in fraud as well as deceptive practices. The case is still in the motion phase.  The case the Company filed
in Nevada against WSBSH has been stayed, pending a decision on a jurisdiction motion we filed in the New York case.  The
Company has been asked by the judge in the New York case to try to come to a settlement and we have been negotiating back and
forth with their attorneys to reach a mutually acceptable settlement. Meanwhile, the court has scheduled a date, November 22,
2016, at which time the company will either announce the settlement or move forward with its Motion to Dismiss based on procedural
failures by the Plaintiff.  

  On
February 12, 2016, the company filed a lawsuit in New York against Kodiak Capital Group LLC, Ryan Hodson, BMA Securities, as well
as Island Capital Management LLC. Kodiak fraudulently purchased the company s existing convertible note from LG capital.
Kodiak then began converting the note into common stock. The suit claims that Ryan Hodson, the principal of Kodiak Capital, engaged
in a scheme to defraud the company. Additionally, the suit claims Hodson and BMA Securities engaged in market manipulation causing
damage to the company. Island Capital is accused of a breach of fiduciary responsibility, by issuing Kodiak the shares of stock.  

On
May 3 , 2016 a Notice of Dismissal was filed for the New York case and on 2016 May 5, 2016 the company filed a lawsuit against
all Kodiak Capital Group et al in the District of California, asserting all of the same allegations as the previously filed New
York case. The company re-filed the action in Federal Court in California to include a new state based fraud claim against the
defendants that are California residents. Our counsel failed to serve process on the defendants. The court dismissed the case
on the procedural ground of lack of prosecution. The Company terminated its litigation counsel due to lack of oversight and other
administrative disputes with counsel. It is expected that this lawsuit will be refiled in early 2017. The Statute of Limitations
for this action is 6 years so the Company has anple time to refile this action.

Company
Overview    

GeneSYS
ID, Inc. (formerly known as Rx Safes, Inc.) was incorporated in 2010 in the State of Nevada. The Company s founders are
pioneers in the fingerprint recognition market and have over 30 years combined experience designing, manufacturing and marketing
fingerprint security products including garage door openers, front door locks, thermostats and mail boxes for companies such as
Master Lock Corporation, Honeywell and The Overhead Door Company. They have developed marketing and sales programs through multiple
distribution channels, including major retailers such as The Home Depot, Costco and Sears, and through development and distribution
agreements with leading manufacturers in various targeted markets.  

The
founders initially saw an opportunity to apply their knowledge with the commercialization of this technology to provide secure
storage solutions and devices for the consumer and professional healthcare markets. Recently, as part of the Company s ongoing
plans to expand the use of its intellectual property and in light of the Company s recent acquisition of biometric access
control company My TOUCH-ID, LLC, the Company underwent a restructuring and renaming whereby the parent holding entity is now
identified as GeneSYS ID, Inc.  GeneSYS ID has three wholly owned subsidiaries; GeneSYS RX, Inc., one of the Company s
operating subsidiaries through which the Company continues to commercialize its IP into the consumer and professional medical
and healthcare markets; My TOUCH ID, LLC, through which the Company implements its biometric technology in various consumer and
commercial access control products; and bioHEALTHMED, Inc. through which the Company is developing an end-to-end clinical trials
management system (CTMS) and remote patient monitoring and medication adherence system, where its IP will be used to authenticate
both the patient and the patient data gathered, as well as to track the cycle of medication from dispensing to administration
at the point of care.   This restructuring also provides the Company with greater opportunity to secure capital for operations
as each subsidiary has the ability to independently raise capital as a private entity without relying upon the parent Company s
market capitalization for valuation purposes. All of the intellectual property continues to be held by the GeneSYS ID, Inc. and
will be licensed to the respective subsidiaries as needed.  

The
Company continues to evaluate various synergistic acquisition targets. The Company has been engaging in discussions with a number
of private and public entities with complementary products and services, some of which have revenues and positive EBITDA. A number
of the target companies have channels to market, which could create an opportunity for new market access for the Company s
products. The Company is also looking at entities that would allow it to acquire skills and technologies needed to support the
business more quickly or at lower cost than the Company could build in-house.  

The
recent acquisition of biometric access control business, My TOUCH ID, LLC, on July 8, 2016 is an example of this and is believed
to provide the Company with valuable intellectual property and the ability to expand the commercialization of its product offerings
into new consumer and commercial access control markets.  

The
Company intends to continue to assess additional acquisition targets through the end of the year.

GeneSYS
RX, Inc. s focus is in the commercialization of the Company s intellectual property into products and solutions, addressing

Secure drug delivery products;   

Integration of products and technology via various communication protocols into enterprise Healthcare Information Systems (HIS);

products to improve levels of security, tracking and reporting;

The
Company is in the early stages of establishing a market for its current and future products and the Company recognizes the importance
of having a strong sales and marketing plan. The Company has begun to establish new distribution relationships with various businesses
and individuals to introduce the Rx DrugSAFE, Rx FieldLOCK, Rx SafeEHR and its overall technology offerings to the market. The
Company s target customers for these products include:

Physicians;  

Group Homes, Nursing Facilities and Hospice;

The
Company plans to build a strong foundation of technology and IP in the professional healthcare market for its medical device products
and plans to leverage existing relationships enjoyed by major medical device manufacturers, where its products and technology
can offer a real value proposition by introducing new innovation into legacy OEM products. This approach is expected to reduce
the overall cost and time to market and is expected to establish credibility through the establishment of relationships with trusted
brands in each respective market for the Company s products.  

The
Company s key focus is to sell and distribute its products and technology through the development of business relationships
with strategic partners who have a stake in the industry and have existing channels to market, or an audience for the Company s
products both in the consumer and commercial healthcare space. In support of this strategy, the Company launched the DoctorDIRECT 
program at the American College of Physicians Conference in Washington, DC. The DoctorDIRECT  program is a simple, no-cost
sales program that targets more than 150,000 physicians nationwide, offering them financial incentives and supporting materials
to help patients and their families safely store prescription medications in the home. Physicians play an important role in patient
education and safety when prescribing medication, and by participating in the program each physician will receive materials including
custom prescription/order pads, drug abuse educational materials, as well as accreditation as a  Prescription Safety Advocate 
practice, demonstrated by a shield which may be displayed in their practice. The program is designed to extend the reach of the
Company s product offerings into physicians  offices and their patients  homes. The Doctor Direct Program is
Sunshine Act exempt, and is both REMS and ACO compliant. The Company has developed a dedicated page at its website where physicians
can register for the program and request supporting materials and the Company also has re-established its direct e-commerce capabilities
to take orders from patients at the Company s site.

bioHEALTH
MED, Inc.   

bioHEALTH MED, Inc. is a healthcare technology company with a mission of providing accurate, real-time remote patient monitoring
solutions, leveraging the Company s proprietary embedded biometric authentication technology for patient verification, medication
adherence and vitals monitoring, to better ensure the accuracy of patient information, medication dosage and other important patient
clinical data. bioHEALTHMED is developing a proprietary Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) utilizing a secure, private and
biometrically enabled and accessible cloud platform, which will allow real-time communications between Clinical Research Organizations
and pharmaceutical companies with their clinical subjects to improve clinical trial results. This platform will also utilize proprietary
biometrically enabled products that feature the Company s Absolute Authentication technology, to  

Table of Contents     

provide
real-time authentication of vital signs, in addition to monitoring medication adherence and compliance. With our fully authenticated
real-time remote patient monitoring system, the Company can offer various stakeholders a solution which will greatly reduce the
risk of medication errors, improve remote patient care and reduce overall healthcare expenditure. The pertinent authenticated
patient data will be provided in real-time to the authorized caregiver, such as a physician, the healthcare system, CRO or a provider,
who can then take pro-active actions to address any risks they see, preventing adverse events from occurring and reduce the need
for more costly in office care or even hospitalization ..  

Verification
and authentication of data in healthcare, especially in clinical trials, plays a very important role in the quality of care, can
save costs, reduce risks and improve patient outcomes. From prescription medication fulfillment and dispensing, to remote patient
monitoring with real time reports, the Company s intellectual property allows it to offer what it believes is the most accurate end-to-end
solutions in the market. The Company believes that pro-active, preventative care of patients outside of the physician s
office or other healthcare facility is key to maintaining patient health and avoiding unnecessary doctor and hospital visits.
These unnecessary preventable visits place a huge avoidable financial burden on the healthcare system. As a result, CMS and private
payers are now reimbursing physicians and health systems if they employ patient monitoring tools to manage the care of their patients
remotely.  

Until
now, there has not been a system that can properly validate the patient in a remote environment exposing these systems to potential
fraudulent activity both on the part of the patient or the provider. Through bioHEALTH MED s bioSKYMED  system, the
Company plans to introduce the next generation of patient care that incorporates one touch security, identification and Absolute
Authentication allowing full control and access to all aspects of health data, reducing doctor s office visits,
reducing prescription medication errors and providing reminders and alerts as well as real-time reports on patient progress
through remote healthcare checks and medication regimen adherence.  

In
addition, currently within clinical research environments, the validity of data gathered from clinical trial participants is unreliable
and voluntarily provided by the participant, which leaves room for considerable error and potential risk of adverse events post
trial. The bioSKYMED  system will provide real-time data capture identifying the trial participant and verifying the medication
is taken as the regimen requires, ensuring true data-integrity. The system will then automatically send this data to the CRO back-end
for evaluation. The Company s system will guarantee that the right dose is taken by the right patient at the right time
and will provide significant benefits to pharmaceutical companies by improving the value of trial data and in doing so streamlining
and expediting the drug approval process, saving millions of dollars in expenses, better validating drug efficacy and hence improving
patient outcomes overall.  

The
Company believes that its IP provides a significant barrier to entry and means such that bioHEALTH MED is in a unique position
to provide this type of authenticated solution to the market. The Company intends to raise capital independently for this venture
to develop its end-to-end solution, acquire complimentary products and technologies to support this system and establish its footprint
as an emerging provider of authenticated remote patient data in the marketplace.  

The
Company believes that this new comprehensive structure of wholly owned subsidiaries with clearly defined market objectives will
provide the best opportunity for the Company to create increased shareholder value. The Company intends to further develop its
plans for its subsidiaries through the end of the year. Additionally, the Company plans to continue to work with its bankers to
secure interim funding for working capital and to pay off the current debt, to identify and secure capital for acquisition targets
to support the Company s various business objectives and to ultimately restructure the business and uplist to a national
exchange.  

Results
of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Revenues    

Our
total revenue reported for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $4,586, an increase from $0 for the same period ended
2015. Our total revenue reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $14,528, a decrease from $50,563 for the same
period ended 2015.  

Table of Contents     

The
revenues we had for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were predominantly from online sales of our Rx DrugSAFE
product at CVS.com and Amazon.com, whereas the revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were predominantly from the
fulfillment of our purchase order from the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics. We do not expect to experience revenues from state grants
in the future months. We hope to achieve increased revenues for the balance of 2016 and into 2017 once we establish sales channels
for our products and implement our business strategies as described above. If we are unable to obtain financing, however, the
implementation of our business strategies will be frustrated and we could go out of business.  

Operating
Expenses    

Operating
expenses decreased to $344,514 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,441,718 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Operating expenses increased to $24,119,763 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $3,546,267 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
main reason for the sharp increase in operating expenses was due to a compensation expenses of $22,700,000 associated with the
conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock into 10,000,000 shares of common stock.  

  The
detail by major category is reflected in the table below.  

Table of Contents     

We
anticipate our operating expenses will increase as we undertake our plan of operations. The increase will be attributable to administrative
and operating costs associated with our business activities and the professional fees associated with our reporting obligations
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  

Other
Income (Expenses)    

We
had other expense of $7,925,921 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from other expenses of $637,554 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The other income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was the result of a loss on the reevaluation
of derivative liabilities of $7,705,379, and interest expense of $220,542. Other expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2015 was the result of a loss on the valuation and revaluation of derivative liabilities of $463,622 and interest expense
including the amortization of debt discounts of $173,932.  

We
had other expense of $7,429,633 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from other expenses of $1,026,707 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was the result of a loss on the reevaluation
of derivative liabilities of $6,703,172 offset by interest expense of $726,461. Other expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2015 was the result of a loss on the valuation and revaluation of derivative liabilities of $733,446 and interest expense
including the amortization of debt discounts of $293,261.  

Net
Loss    

We
incurred a net loss of $8,270,344 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $2,079,272 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. We incurred a net loss of $31,546,683 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to a net loss of $4,547,921 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had total current assets of $64,143 and total current liabilities of $9,628,670. We had a working capital
deficit of $9,564,527 as of September 30, 2016.  

Operating
activities used $688,647 in cash for nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with cash used of $128,198 for the same
period ended 2015. Our net loss of $31,546,683 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow, offset by $22,700,000
resulting from the conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock into 10,000,000 shares of common stock.  

Cash
flows provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $710,492, as compared with
$123,927 for the same period ended 2015. Proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes of $707,000, related party advances of
$12,500, and common stock of $50,000, offset by repayments on related party loan advances of $3,150 and repayments on convertible
notes and accrued interest of $55,858, were the main components of our positive financing cash flow during the nine month ended
September 30, 2016.  

We
continue to be dependent on raising capital to operate the business and are in the process of pursuing a minimum of $1,000,000
equity investment to support our business objectives over the next 12 months. If we raise less than this amount, we will have
to scale back our operations commensurate with the funding, if any, that we receive. Our efforts are ongoing but we can provide
no assurance that we will be able to raise the optimal amount needed to implement our business plan.  

As
described above, we continue to work on expanding our product offerings, but our progress, while blistering in some areas, is
held back dramatically because of our current inability to attract real capital. We believe that recent shorting activity has
negatively affected our stock price to the detriment of our company and our shareholders. We have been forced to seek interim
funding through variable convertible debt financing, placing additional pressures on the balance sheet.  

The
continued shorting and issuance of shares into the market from noteholder conversions has further negatively affected our stock
price and consequently diminished our ability to secure capital that is less dilutive than the variable convertible debt financing.  

Table of Contents     

To
address these ongoing concerns, the Company terminated its transfer agent on September 6, 2016, preventing further toxic conversions
and bringing all parties to the table to discuss a satisfactory settlement which would provide the Company with a window to redeem
the outstanding notes over an extended period of time and prevent any further conversions for several months. We have been actively
negotiating this settlement with our existing noteholders, with a plan to convert their debt holdings into non-dilutive equity
and provide a workable solution to the problem. We are hopeful that these efforts will result in a positive solution that will
not only benefit the company, but should also allow the noteholders to make a return on their investments. As we are in the midst
of negotiations, no firm commitments have yet been reached as of the date of preparing this document. We hope to provide further
news and disclosures in the weeks ahead. We are also hopeful that these efforts will facilitate the ability the raise more traditional
capital through our investment banking relationship and other capital sources that we continue to pursue. This process will take
time and is not guaranteed, but we believe with hard work and the right partners, it is extremely achievable.  

As
previously disclosed, we have executed three comprehensive agreements with an Investment Bank which remain active and are still
in effect. One of those agreements is an exclusive investment banking agreement for a 12 month period that expires in May, 2017.
These agreements were signed with a view to establishing a multi-tiered financing approach and a reliable form of financing for
the Company to move the business forward. To date, the investment bank has not yet performed under the agreements. One issue was
the accelerated decline in our public stock price hampering efforts to raise interim capital to take out our current variable-rate
convertible debt. The initial approach and strategy to retire this debt was changed in September based on our declining stock
price. We intend to continue working with the investment bank, but our current stock price may be an impediment and we are taking
steps to stabilize and turn it in a positive direction. In the meantime, we are concentrating our fundraising efforts at our subsidiary
level which will not have a dilutive effect on our public shareholder base.  

Based
upon our current financial condition, we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business at the current level for the next
twelve months. We intend to fund operations through increased sales and non variable-rate debt and/or equity financing arrangements,
which may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements. We plan to seek additional financing in a private equity
offering to secure funding for operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional funding.
If we are not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance
that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle, which contemplate
continuation of our company as a going concern. However, we had minimal revenues for the three and nine months ending September
30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015. We currently have negative working capital, and have not completed our efforts to establish
a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time.  

Management
anticipates that we will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. We intend
to position our company so that we may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s
efforts, there are no assurances that we will be successful in this or any of our endeavors or become financially viable and continue
as a going concern.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

In
December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most  critical accounting polices  in the Management
Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a  critical accounting policy  is one which is both important to the
portrayal of a company s financial condition and results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
We do not believe that any accounting policies currently fit this definition. Our significant accounting policies are contained
in Note 2 to our financial statements included herein.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

Table of Contents     

On
May 1, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  which is the new comprehensive
revenue recognition standard that will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The standard s core
principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective
for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. Entities will have
the option of using either a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the guidance in the ASU. The Company
will continue to assess the impact on its financial statements.  

In
June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments
When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.  This
ASU provides more explicit guidance for treating share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects
vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition. The new guidance is effective
for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance
to have a material impact on the financial statements.  

On
June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities
(Topic 915). Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity from Topic
915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US GAAP. In addition,
the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information on the statements
of income, cash flows and shareholder s equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity;
(3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose in the first year
in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The amendments
are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and interim reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements
have yet to be issued. The Company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial
statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented inception-to-date information on the respective financial
statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Topic 205-40) ,
which requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going
concern for each annual and interim reporting period. If substantial doubt exists, additional disclosure is required. This new
standard will be effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company expects to adopt this new standard for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015 and the Company will continue
to assess the impact on its financial statements.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

We
conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2016, to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time periods specified in the Securities  

Table of Contents     

Exchange
Commission s rules and forms, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or
submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and
principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September
30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses
identified and described below.  

Our
principal executive officers do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud.
Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and
our principal executive officers have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of
the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual
a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions.  

Remediation
Plan to Address the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. Management identified the following three material weaknesses that have caused management to remediate
that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, were
more effective at the reasonable assurance level:  

1.      
We did not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of the period ending September 30, 2016.
Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment
of our disclosure controls and procedures and has taken remedial steps to comply and reduce the control deficiency that resulted
represented a material weakness.  

2.      
We did not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size
and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to
the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed
by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our
disclosure controls and procedures and has taken steps to remediate these deficiencies by engaging a new outside accounting consultant
as well as securing the full time services of our Chief Financial Officer, who was previously a part time employee.   

3.      
Effective controls over the control environment were not maintained. Specifically, a formally adopted written code of business
conduct and ethics that governs our employees, officers, and directors was not in place. Additionally, management has not developed
and effectively communicated to employees its accounting policies and procedures. The company s Board of Directors is in
the process of approving a written code of business conduct and ethics that will govern our employees and directors. Further,
our Board of Directors does not currently have any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial
expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the
organization, management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness. To remedy this, the company s
Board of Directors will be  

Table of Contents     

adopting
a Board Charter which requires the establishment of an audit committee, the mandate for which will be to eventually have all independent
members and the Board is in the process of evaluating possible candidates. Meanwhile, the committee will have the ability to consult
with outside independent financial experts.  

To
address these overall material weaknesses, management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial
statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the periods presented and has take the steps identified above. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included
in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the
periods presented.  

We
have already taken steps to remedy our material weakness with regard to insufficient segregation of duties by hiring additional
employees in order to segregate duties in a manner that establishes effective internal controls once resources become available.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

No
change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report, the period
ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

II   OTHER INFORMATION   

     Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

Aside
from that below, we are not a party to any pending legal proceeding. We are not aware of any pending legal proceeding to which
any of our officers, directors, or any beneficial holders of 5% or more of our voting securities are adverse to us or have a material
interest adverse to us.  

    Legal
Proceedings    

  On
March 5, 2015, Wall Street Buy Sell Hold filed a lawsuit against the Company in New York alleging breach of a consulting agreement
between the parties. On March 10, 2015 the company filed a lawsuit against Wall Street Buy Hold Sell in Nevada. The suit claims
WSBHS engaged in fraud as well as deceptive practices. The case is still in the motion phase.  The case the Company filed
in Nevada against WSBSH has been stayed, pending a decision on a jurisdiction motion we filed in the New York case.  The
Company has been asked by the judge in the New York case to try to come to a settlement and we have been negotiating back and
forth with their attorneys to reach a mutually acceptable settlement. Meanwhile, the court has scheduled a date, November 22,
2016, at which time the company will either announce the settlement or move forward with its Motion to Dismiss based on procedural
failures by the Plaintiff.  

  On
February 12, 2016, the company filed a lawsuit in New York against Kodiak Capital Group LLC, Ryan Hodson, BMA Securities, as well
as Island Capital Management LLC. Kodiak fraudulently purchased the company s existing convertible note from LG capital.
Kodiak then began converting the note into common stock. The suit claims that Ryan Hodson, the principal of Kodiak Capital, engaged
in a scheme to defraud the company. Additionally, the suit claims Hodson and BMA Securities engaged in market manipulation causing
damage to the company. Island Capital is accused of a breach of fiduciary responsibility, by issuing Kodiak the shares of stock.  

On
May 3 , 2016 a Notice of Dismissal was filed for the New York case and on 2016 May 5, 2016 the company filed a lawsuit against
all Kodiak Capital Group et al in the District of California, asserting all of the same allegations as the previously filed New
York case. The company re-filed the action in Federal Court in California to include a new state based fraud claim against the
defendants that are California residents. Our counsel failed to serve process on the defendants. The court dismissed the case
on the procedural ground of lack of prosecution. The Company terminated its litigation counsel due to lack of oversight and other
administrative disputes with counsel. It is expected that this lawsuit will be refiled in early 2017. The Statute of Limitations
for this action is 6 years so the Company has anple time to refile this action.
