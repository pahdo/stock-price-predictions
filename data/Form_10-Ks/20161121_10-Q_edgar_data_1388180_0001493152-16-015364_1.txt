1.   
       Basis
    of Presentation and Continuance    

Novus
Robotics Inc. ( Novus  or  the Company ) , formerly known as Ecoland International Inc. ( Ecoland ),
a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on June 24, 2005 under the name Guano Distributors, Inc. for the purpose of selling Dry-Bar
Cave bat guano. On June 28, 2006, the articles of incorporation were amended to change its name to Ecoland. On March 13, 2012,
the articles of incorporation were amended to change the Company s name to Novus. The Company carries on business in one
segment being the engineering, design and the manufacturing of automated tube processing solutions for the automotive industry.  

2.   
       SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Basis
of presentation   

These
interim consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States and are expressed in US dollars. The functional currency of Novus is the Canadian Dollar.  

The
interim consolidated financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of results in accordance with
General Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ), have been included and properly prepared
within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below. The
interim consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the Company s latest annual report on Form
10-K and the results for the period ending September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the full year amount.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Novus and its wholly owned subsidiaries D R
Technologies Inc and D R Tools Inc. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.  

Uses
of Estimates   

The
preparation of interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Financial statement items subject to significant judgment include expense accruals, as well as income taxes and loss contingencies.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

The
areas which require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining carrying values include,
but are not limited to:  

Assets 
carrying values and impairment charges    

Assets,
including property and equipment and inventory, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that their carrying amount exceed their recoverable amounts. In the determination of carrying values and impairment charges, management
looks at the higher of recoverable amount or fair value less costs to sell in the case of assets and at objective evidence, significant
or prolonged decline of fair value on financial assets indicating impairment. These determinations and their individual assumptions
require that management make a decision based on the best available information at each reporting period.

       SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES   continued    

Income
taxes and recoverability of potential deferred tax assets    

In
assessing the probability of realizing income tax assets recognized, management makes estimates related to expectations of future
taxable income, applicable tax planning opportunities, expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the
likelihood that tax positions taken will be sustained upon examination by applicable tax authorities. In making its assessments,
management gives additional weight to positive and negative evidence that can be objectively verified. Estimates of future taxable
income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. The Company
considers whether relevant tax planning opportunities are within the Company s control, are feasible, and are within management s
ability to implement. Examination by applicable tax authorities is supported based on individual facts and circumstances of the
relevant tax position examined in light of all available evidence. Where applicable tax laws and regulations are either unclear
or subject to ongoing varying interpretations, it is reasonably possible that changes in these estimates can occur that materially
affect the amounts of income tax assets recognized. Also, future changes in tax laws could limit the Company from realizing the
tax benefits from the deferred tax assets. The Company reassesses unrecognized income tax assets at each reporting period.  

Warranty
provision   

In
assessing the warranty provision, management makes estimates related to expectations of future repair cost needed to service new
seat frame sales under its two year warranty terms. These determinations and their individual assumptions require that management
make a decision based on the best available information at each reporting period  

Long-lived
Assets   

In
accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC No. 360,  Property, Plant and Equipment 
the carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts
or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future
cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying
amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.  

Regulatory
Matters   

The
Company is subject to a variety of federal, provincial and state regulations governing land use, health, safety and environmental
matters. The Company s management believes it has been in substantial compliance with all such regulations.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
At September 30, 2016, the Company had no cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which may
exceed federally insured limits. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s accounts are insured for $100,000 CDN by Canadian
Deposit Insurance Corporation for Canadian bank deposits and are insured for $250,000 by FDIC for US bank deposits.

       SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES   continued    

Factoring
Agreement and Accounts Receivable   

The
Company has a financing agreement that included a non-recourse factoring arrangement that provides nonrecourse factoring on the
Company s receivable from its primary customer Johnson Controls, Inc. to assist in its operational cash flow requirements.
The factor is based on credit approved orders, assumes the accounts receivable risk of the Company s customer in the event
of insolvency or non-payment. The Company assumes the risk on accounts receivable not factored to which is shown as accounts receivable
on the accompanying balance sheets. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, factored accounts receivable were $Nil and
$Nil respectively. Finance charges associated with the sale of factored receivable for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 were $1,117 and $10,041 and are included in office and general expense.  

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts   

The
Company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company s
best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company s existing accounts receivable. The Company determines
the allowance based on specific customer information, historical write-off experience and current industry and economic data.
Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
Management believes that there are no concentrations of credit risk for which an allowance has not been established. Although
management believes that the allowance is adequate, it is possible that the estimated amount of cash collections with respect
to accounts receivable could change. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has not deemed any accounts uncollectible.  

Inventory   

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method. Cost of work in progress and
finished goods includes raw materials, direct labor and indirect manufacturing costs. The Company s inventory balance at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was comprised of work-in-progress. This policy requires D R to make estimates regarding
the market value of our inventory, including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventory. The Company determines excess and
obsolete inventory based on an estimate of the future demand and estimated selling prices for its products.  

Fixed
Assets   

Fixed
assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is recorded on a straight line basis reflective of the useful lives of the assets. Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations when incurred, while additions and betterments are capitalized. When assets
are retired or disposed, the asset s original cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from accounts and
any gain or loss is reflected in income.

    ACCOUNTING POLICIES   continued    

Foreign
Currency Translation   

Gains
and losses arising upon settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination
of income. The Company s functional currency is the Canadian dollar. Transactions in foreign currency are translated into
Canadian dollars then translated into U.S. dollars for reporting in accordance with the ASC 830-30 as follows:  

For assets and liabilities, the exchange rate at the balance sheet date shall be used.  

For
revenues, expenses, gains, and losses, the exchange rate at the dates on which those elements are recognized shall be used.  

Translation
adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders  equity.  

The company experienced a large foreign exchange gain in the third quarter of 2016. This has been primarily
attributed to the timing of conversion of US dollars funds to Canadian dollars at more favourable exchange rates than when the
original sale was recorded. The company identified inconsistencies with its foreign exchange calculations, which were accumulatively
adjusted during the period, resulting in an additional foreign exchange during the 3 month period ending September 30, 2016 to
conform with our stated policies. In addition, a previously carry forward adjustment of approximately $186,000 was reclassified
from the current year foreign exchange to accumulated other comprehensive income in order to align the financial reporting with
the disclosed accounting policies.  

Financial
Instruments   

The
carrying values of the Company s financial instruments, which comprise cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll
liabilities, loan payable, taxes payable and due to officers/shareholders, approximate their fair values due to the immediate
or short-term maturity of these instruments. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure
to foreign currency risk.  

Fair
Value Measurements   

The
authoritative guidance for fair values establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring
fair value. Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than
quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs
in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.  

Income
Taxes   

Potential
benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted
ASC 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes,  as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to compute
tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized
in these financial statements because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will be able to utilize the
net operating losses carried forward in future years.  

Recorded
in other (income) and expenses are monies recovered relating to non-refundable, federal government Scientific Research   Experimental
Development ( SR ED ) tax credits. Due to the uncertain nature of these expenditures, the Company does not record
any amount until such time as the deduction is approved by Canadian provincial and federal governments. SR ED expenditures
relating to 2015 taxation year were applied to recover previously paid taxes for which the Company obtained approval and received
the requisite funds in the third quarter of 2016.   

Advertising
Costs   

Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. No advertising costs have been incurred by the Company to date.

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements  ( SAB 101 ) as modified by SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin No.104. Under SAB 101, revenue is recognized on a percentage of completions basis and when collection of the resulting
receivable is reasonably assured.  

1.  
      Spare
    parts   Revenues and cost of sales are recognized at the time of sale.   

2.  
      Service
      Revenues and cost of sales are recognized at the time services are performed and accepted by customer via sign off.   

3.  
      Seat
    systems and tooling   progress invoicing to the customer are recorded as deferred revenue. When the projects are installed
    and accepted by the customer the final invoice is issued and all deferred revenue is recognized along with the related work
    in process costs for the project. Systems generally take 20-28 weeks to design, manufacture, assemble, and then ship to our
    various customers. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 customer deposits were $1,296,571 and $349,092 respectively.   

D R
provides standard warranties for its product from the date of shipment. Estimated warranty obligations are recorded at the time
of sale. Estimated warranty obligations are recorded at the time of sale and amortized over the two year warranty period. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, warranty liability was $12,045 and $7,977.  

Earnings
per Common Share   

Net
income per share is provided in accordance with ASC 260-10,  Earnings per Share . We present basic income per share
( EPS ) and diluted EPS the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing reported net income
(loss) applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Except
where the result would be anti-diluted to income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share would be computed assuming
the conversion of the convertible long-term debt and the elimination of the related interest expense, and the exercise of stock
warrants. Income per common share has been computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year.  

Comprehensive
Income   

The
Company has adopted ASC 220,  Comprehensive Income,  which establishes standards for reporting and the display of
comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income (loss) is defined to include all changes in
equity except those resulting from investments by owners or distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, ASC 220 requires
that all items that are required to be recognized under the current accounting standards as a component of comprehensive income
be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. Comprehensive income
(loss) is displayed in the balance sheet as a component of shareholders  equity.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

Company evaluated the following recent accounting updates and are evaluating the potential impact upon adoption:

      FIXED ASSETS   

Fixed
assets are comprised of the following:  

Depreciation
expense for the quarter end September 30, 2016 was $6,414 (2015 - $12,372).  

4.   
       CONVERTIBLE
    NOTES PAYABLE    

The
convertible notes payable to Berardino Paolucci, CEO, are unsecured, due on demand, accrue interest at the rate of 8.0% per annum,
and are convertible into shares of our restricted common stock at the rate of $0.005 per share. During fiscal 2014, the Company
repaid $176,599 to the assigned note holder. As at September 30, 2016, interest in the amount of $2,795 (December 31, 2015 -$526)
is owing and has been included in accounts payable and accrued expenses.  

During
the first quarter of 2016, it was determined that as of the date of the reverse merger and recapitalization between Ecoland and
D R Technologies Inc. on January 27, 2012, there were certain inaccuracies regarding the amounts recorded as owing on the
convertible notes payable that were assigned to Mr. Paolucci. These notes were converted for 75,733 common shares in January 2015.
Upon making this determination, Mr. Paolucci terminated the transaction, returned his shares to treasury for cancellation and
reinstated the convertible notes payable under the terms and conditions referenced above. This reversal of the transaction is
deemed to have occurred in 2015 for accounting purposes and the outstanding principal and accrued interest payable on the aforementioned
notes have been adjusted to reflect the correct balances owing at December 31, 2015.  

On
September 7, 2016, Mr. Paolucci sold the notes including interest to a third party. On October 20, 2016, the third party converted
$25,000 of the principal of the note in exchange for 5,000,000 common shares.

       OBLIGATION
    UNDER CAPITAL LEASE    

The
Company entered into a lease to purchase equipment in November of 2015. An initial payment of $16,900 was made with the balance
of the lease to be satisfied in 36 equal monthly payments of approximately $820. The interest rate related to the lease obligation
is 14% with a maturity date of November 2018 at which time the option exists to purchase the equipment for $4,600. Minimum lease
payments to maturity are as follows:

       COMMON
    STOCK    

On
October 26, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split of one for three hundred reverse stock split of the Company s
total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The Reverse Stock Split was affected on January 21, 2016 and reduced the
total number of issued and outstanding common shares from 88,650,000 to 295,500. The resultant decrease in the value attributed
to the common stock was transferred to Additional Paid In Capital ( APIC ) in the amount of $88,354. All share and
related stock option information presented in these consolidated financial statements has been retroactively adjusted to the reduced
number of shares resulting from this transaction.  

Each
share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible on a one-for-one basis into common stock, has all of the voting rights that the
holders of the common shares and has the ability to elect three directors.  

The
Series B Preferred Stock ( Series B ) has voting rights whose holders must vote together with the common stock. Each
Series B share has the same number of votes equal to 5,000 common shares and in the event of a stock split, share dividend or
otherwise for the common shares will retain this voting proportion.  

On
February 25, 2016, the Company approved the purchase of materials relating to the design, construction and operation of robots
in automation for medical and surgical purposes valued at $50,000 from Mr. Dino Paolucci, a board member as well as President
and CEO and Mr. Drasko Karanovic, a board member, both being related parties, in exchange for 1,000,000 Series B Preferred Shares
and 49,000,000 common shares. The acquired technology was previously held by individuals who also have majority control the Company,
resulting in the Company recording the transaction at cost. As such, no value was assigned to the technology purchased and the
par value of shares issued was charged against additional paid-in capital.  

7.   
       CONCENTRATIONS    

In
previous years, the Company had significant economic and commercial dependence on Johnson Controls, Inc. ( JCI  ).
As a result, D R was subject to significant financial risk in the event of financial distress of JCI. For the year ended December
31, 2015 more than 53% sales and 20% of its receivables was to this entity. During the first three quarter ended September 30,
2016, it was determined that Novus was not economically dependent on JCI.

       LEASES
    AND OTHER COMMITMENTS    

The
Company leases premises totaling 18,000 square feet with monthly lease payments of approximately CDN$8,400 per month. Total minimum
lease payments of CDN$285,600 are required to the lease expiration date on July 31, 2019.  

D R
Technology failed to comply with Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 regarding registration of its common shares issued to
shareholders of D Mecatronics in connection with its spin-off of D R Technology in 2011. In management s opinion, any
legal liability with this failure to comply has been deemed remote.   

9.   
       RESTATEMENT    

In the fiscal year ending 2015,The Company determined that as on January 27, 2012, the date of the reverse
merger and recapitalization between Ecoland and D R Technologies Inc., that it had incorrectly recorded its purchase price
deficiency in Additional Paid In Capital rather than in retained earnings. The impact of the restatement was to reclassify the
deficiency from APIC to retained earnings such that APIC increased $220,803 and retained earnings decreased by $220,803. The net
impact of this transaction had no effect on the net income or comprehensive income or statement of cash flows.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

GENERAL   

We
were formed in the State of Nevada on June 24, 2005 under the name Guano Distributors, Inc. Prior to our incorporation, on April
15, 2005, David Wallace, our then-chief executive officer, chief financial officer and sole director, formed Guano Distributors
(Pty) Ltd., a South African registered company, for the purpose of selling Dry-Bar Cave bat guano. On May 15, 2005, Mr. Wallace
transferred all of his ownership interest in Guano Distributors (Pty) Ltd. to us. On June 28, 2006, we amended our Articles of
Incorporation to change our name to Ecoland International, Inc.  

Please
note that throughout this Annual Report, and unless otherwise noted, the words  we,   our,   us, 
the  Company,  or  Novus Robotics,  refers to Novus Robotics Inc.  

Reverse
Stock Split   

On
October 26, 2015, the Board of Directors and our majority shareholders approved a reverse stock split of one for three hundred
(1:300) of our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the  Reverse Stock Split ). Pursuant to our Bylaws
and the Nevada Revised Statutes, a vote by the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding votes is required to effect the
Reverse Stock Split. Our articles of incorporation do not authorize cumulative voting. As of the record date of October 26, 2015,
we had 111,370,000 voting shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The consenting stockholders of the shares of common stock
are entitled to 65,564,000 votes, which represented approximately 58.54% of the voting rights associated with our shares of common
stock. The consenting stockholders voted in favor of the Reverse Stock Split described herein in a unanimous written consent dated
October 26, 2015.  

The
Board of Directors had previously considered factors regarding their approval of the Reverse Stock Split including, but not limited
to: (i) the current volume of trading and trading price of our shares of common stock on the OTCQB Market and potential to increase
the marketability and liquidity of our common stock based on structuring of potential business operations and acquisition; and
(ii) limitation of marketability of our common stock among brokerage firms and institutional investors based upon current per-share
price. Our Board of Directors approved the Reverse Stock Split and recommended the majority shareholders of the Company review
and approve the Reverse Stock Split.  

The
Reverse Stock Split was effected on January 21, 2016 based upon the filing of appropriate documentation with FINRA. The Reverse
Stock Split decreased the Company s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock from approximately 111,370,000 shares
to 371,233 shares of common stock. The common stock will continue to be $0.001 par value. The Company s trading symbol continues
to be  NRBT . Our new cusip number is 670011H207.  

Share
Exchange Agreement    

Ecoland
International, Inc., now known as Novus Robotics Inc., D R Technology Inc., a private corporation ( D R Technology )
and, Berardino Paolucci and Drasko Karanovic, the shareholders of D R Technology Inc. (the  D R Shareholders )
entered into that certain share exchange agreement dated January 27, 2012 (the  Share Exchange Agreement ). Our Board
of Directors approved the execution and consummation of the transaction under the Share Exchange Agreement on February 1, 2012.
In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement, we issued an aggregate of 59,000,000 pre-Reverse
Stock Split shares of our restricted common stock to the D R Shareholders (which consisted of Messrs. Paolucci and Karanovic
and D Mecatronics, which is holding the shares for the benefit of the remaining shareholders of D R Technology) in exchange
for 100% of the total issued and outstanding shares of D R Technology, thus making D R Technology its wholly-owned subsidiary.
Our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of our shareholders to enter into the Share Exchange Agreement pursuant
to which it would acquire all the technology and assets and assume all liabilities of D R Technology. This resulted in a change
in control and our overall business operations thus bringing potential value to our shareholders. D R Technology was previously
the wholly-owned subsidiary of D Mecatronics Inc., a Delaware corporation. On approximately November 10, 2011, D Mecatronics spun-off
D R Technology. D R Technology subsequently issued shares of its restricted common stock to the shareholders of D Mecatronics
on a pro-rata basis in accordance with their respective equity holdings in D Mecatronics. The equity percentages regarding the
issuance of shares by D R Technology were 48% to Berardino Paolucci, 24% to Drasko Karanovic and 28% to various shareholders
(which shares were previously held by D Mecatronics on behalf of these shareholders).  

Escrow
Agreement.  On June 4, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the execution of that certain escrow agreement dated June 4,
2013 (the  Escrow Agreement ) with Manhattan Transfer Registrar Co., our transfer agent ( Manhattan Transfer ).
As disclosed in previous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on approximately November 10, 2011, D Mecatronics
Inc. ( D Mecatronics ) spun-off our wholly-owned subsidiary, D R Technology. D R Technology subsequently issued
shares of its restricted common stock to the shareholders of D Mecatronics on a pro-rata basis in accordance with their respective
equity holdings in D Mecatronics. The equity percentages regarding the issuance of shares by D R Technology were 48% to Berardino
Paolucci, 24% to Drasko Karanovic and 28% to various shareholders (which shares were being held by D Mecatronics on behalf of
these shareholders). The transfer agent for D Mecatronics at the time of the spin-off was Global Sentry Equity Transfer Inc. ( Global
Sentry ). At the time of the spin-off, management of D Mecatronics had attempted on several occasions to contact Global
Sentry with regards to its shareholder list and records. However, any and all attempts were to no avail. To date, D Mecatronics
has not been able to obtain any of its records, including a shareholders list, from Global Sentry. Management has no knowledge
or information as to the whereabouts of Global Sentry or its management nor of the location of its records and shareholders list.
This has impeded the issuance of the shares of D R Technology to the appropriate 28% minority shareholders of D Mecatronics
and thus the reason why D Mecatronics was holding the shares in trust for the benefit of its shareholders.  

Subsequently,
we entered into the Share Exchange Agreement. Our Board of Directors had approved the execution and consummation of the transaction
under the Share Exchange Agreement on February 1, 2012. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement,
we issued an aggregate of 59,000,000 pre-Reverse Stock Split shares of our restricted common stock to the D R Shareholders
(which consisted of Messrs. Paolucci and Karanovic and D Mecatronics, which held the shares for the benefit of the remaining shareholders
of D R Technology) in exchange for 100% of the total issued and outstanding shares of D R Technology, thus making D R
Technology our wholly-owned subsidiary. The Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the shareholders to enter into
the Share Exchange Agreement pursuant to which it would acquire all the technology and assets and assume all liabilities of D R
Technology.  

The
majority shareholders of D R Technology approved the Share Exchange Agreement as did its Board of Directors. The Board of
Directors of D R Technology resolved in its board resolutions to issue to D Mecatronics the 16,520,000 pre-Reverse Stock Split
shares to be issued to the missing 28% minority shareholders of D R Technology (who are also the unknown shareholders of D
Mecatronics). Therefore, D Mecatronics held in trust and for the benefit of its unknown shareholders (and as shareholders of D R
Technology) the shares to be issued to them by the Company. D Mecatronics is in the process of attempting to locate the transfer
agent in order to obtain its records.  

We
are also in the process of locating the missing shareholders of D Mecatronics (and also as shareholders of D R Technology)
to whom our shares should be issued in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement. Therefore, we
entered into the Escrow Agreement. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement, D Mecatronics returned
to Manhattan Transfer the share certificate evidencing the shares of our common stock issued to it as trustee. A new share certificate
was issued to Manhattan Transfer as trustee in the aggregate denomination of 16,520,000 shares to be held in escrow. Together
with Manhattan Transfer, we created a shareholders list (the  Shareholders List ) indicating each record owner of
the shares. Subsequent to the date of the Escrow Agreement, Manhattan Transfer has released shares to certain of the persons indicated
on the Shareholders List. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, Manhattan Transfer has issued approximately 5,331,641 of the
16,520,000 pre-Reverse Stock Split shares held in escrow to the shareholders listed on the Shareholder List.  

We
have placed on our website www.novusrobotics.com under  Investor Relations  contact information to be used by persons/entities
that believe they were shareholders of D Mecatronics. Such individuals/entities should contact our management.  

CURRENT
BUSINESS OPERATIONS   

We
are involved in the area of engineering, design and manufacture of robotics and automation technology solutions for tube bending
machines, which management believes will enable us to become a recognized technology pioneer and market leader in the area of
engineering. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, D R Technology, we will provide state of the art automation technologies
through its automated tube bending machines which we design, engineer and build for the automotive industry to solve its customers 
complex automation needs, increase efficiencies and improve manufacturing processes. Serving as a comprehensive engineering partner,
we will work with other leading robotic manufacturers to provide the best automation technologies. We will provide automation
solutions to a wide spectrum of customers and industries ranging from large Fortune 500 companies to small privately-held businesses.
Our automated solutions can be found in manufacturing, assembly and processing lines throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico
and South America. D R Technology, has served the automotive industry for more than twelve years and is currently applying
its service solutions to other markets, such as medical robotics, personal robotic devices and water treatment industry. Management
believes that increasing use of robotics in sectors such as food handling and processing, clean technology and energy, as well
as pharmaceutical and general consumer goods production, will lead to increased demand for company s products as manufacturers
look to improve the speed, quality and reliability of production through automation. As of the date of this Annual Report, we
have not generated any revenue from the medical robotics, personal robotic devices, water treatment industry, food handling and
processing, clean technology and energy or pharmaceutical and general consumer goods production.  

We
are involved in the area of engineering, design and the manufacturing of automated solutions through its automated tube bending
machines for the automotive industry and intends to rapidly become one of the leading providers of automated manufacturing solutions,
which are used primarily by three of the top ten Tier I automotive part suppliers in the world. We also make precision components
and tooling using our own custom-built manufacturing systems, process knowledge and automation technology. We purchase from third
parties components for the electrical cabinet, which creates the automation and controls section of the machinery. The electrical
cabinet consists of fuses, holders, relays, cables, wiring, controls and sensors, which we purchase from our suppliers, i.e. Gerrie
Electric, Beckhoff, Allen Bradley and others. We integrate these purchased parts from our suppliers into our electrical and controls
design to make the automated tube bending machines operational. We provide all the programming of the electrical cabinet as well.
The computer programming is based upon the specific needs.  

Our
business is in the early development and operating stages. To date, our primary activities include designing and installation
of retrofits to existing automated systems, automated spare parts for our tube bending machines, automated maintenance and repairs.
We are currently offering products such as Seat Frame Systems, IP Tube systems and Integrated Bend-Weld Systems for the automotive
industry. Our primary focus will be placed on product engineering and manufacturing processes as discussed above to ensure the
highest quality, product features and efficient manufacturing processing.  

We
are a full service provider of turn-key production solutions, specializing in tubular components for our tube bending machines.
Our experience is firmly rooted in fabrication solutions for automated components, such as seat frames and instrument panel beams.
Our expertise is in the areas of automation and machinery for computer numerical control (CNC) bending, forming, piercing and
laser cutting, which is applicable to a wide range of production solutions. We produce spare parts for the manufacturing equipment
we design. We do not produce spare parts for automobiles.  

Technology
Purchase Agreement   

On
February 25, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the execution of that certain technology purchase agreement dated February
25, 2016 (the  Technology Purchase Agreement ) among the Company and Berardino Paolucci, our President/CEO and a member
of the Board of Directors, and Drasko Karanovic, a member of the Board of Directors (collectively, the  Sellers ).
The Sellers had previously researched, created and developed medical robotics technology, which deals with the design, construction
and operation of robots in automation for medical and surgical purposes ( Medical Robotic Technology ).  

In
accordance with the terms and provisions of the Technology Purchase Agreement, we acquired all of the Sellers  right, title
and interest in and to certain assets as follows (the  Assets ):  

(a)
All plans, specifications, drawings, concepts, designs, prototypes, techniques, tools, diagrams, outlines, descriptions, information,
data, engineering studies and reports, test results, models, manufacturing processes and flowcharts;  

(b)
All raw materials, supplies, work in progress, finished product and lists of suppliers;  

(c)
All software programs and software code relating thereto, if any and all copies and tangible embodiments of the software programs
and software code (in source and object code form), together with all documentation related to such programs and code;  

(d)
All intellectual property rights including, but not limited to, future patent applications, patents, trademarks, trade names,
copyrights, exercisable or available in any jurisdiction of the world, and the exclusive right for Purchaser to hold itself out
to be the successor to the Medical Robotic Technology business of Sellers;  

(e)
All licenses to the Assets and properties of third parties (including licenses with respect to intellectual property rights owned
by third parties);  

(f)
Claims, causes of actions, royalty rights, deposits, and rights and claims to refunds (including tax refunds) and adjustments
of any kind (including rights to set-off and recoupment), and insurance proceeds;  

(g)
All Internet domain names and registrations that are held or owned by Sellers which relate or refer to the business or Assets;  

(h)
All franchises, permits, licenses, agreements, waivers, and authorizations from, issued, or granted by any governmental authority;
and  

(i)
Copies of marketing and sales information, including potential pricing and customer lists.  

In
further accordance with the terms and provisions of the Technology Purchase Agreement, we issued to each of Messrs. Paolucci and
Karanovic 500,000 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and 24,500,000 post-Reverse Stock Split shares of restricted common stock.
See  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Securities and Use of Proceeds .  

The
Sellers each represented and confirmed that Berardino Paolucci is the Chief Executive Officer/President and a member of the Board
of Directors and Drasko Karanovic is a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, that both Berardino Paolucci and Drasko
Karanovic acknowledged and confirmed their fiduciary duties as such, and that Berardino Paolucci and Drasko Karanovic and we have
negotiated in good faith with the best interests of our shareholders in consideration of the transaction.  

Valuation.
 Per ASC 850-10, transactions between related parties are quite normal in the course of business. It however, does not contain
any measurement or recognition requirements for related-party transactions. Therefore to determine how to treat the value of the
transaction, consideration must be given as to whether the Technology Purchase Agreement was in the normal course of business.  

Management
would suggest this is the first step in diversifying our business interests. We have been exclusively catering to the automotive
market and a decision has been made to develop a new line of business to assist with the cash flow fluctuations inherent with
the ebbs and the flows faced in today s economy. This event would then suggest it is currently not in the normal course
of business to transfer intellectual property not related to its current operation to the corporation from its owners. The transaction
would then conceivably be properly recorded in equity to reflect the benefit conferred to the majority shareholders of the business
being Mr Paolucci and Mr Karanovic as a reduction of the additional paid-in capital account. As this property was self-constructed
and there is no independent valuation, the most conservative estimate would be to value the intangible property at $1.  

Management
has placed a value on the property commensurate with the shares that have been issued. The following analysis considers the alternatives:  

1.  
      Prior
    to the Reverse Stock Split, we had approximately 88,650,000 common shares trading in and around $0.01, resulting in a market
    cap of $0.9 million.    

2.  
      Had
    the business issued another 50,000,000 common shares to effect this transaction, the number of shares outstanding would have
    increased to 138,650,000 and resulted in a decline of the price per share of $0.006.   

3.  
      Given
    this is a thinly traded stock and the number of shares that would have been entering the market, it is not unreasonable to
    assume a dilution of this nature would not have changed the overall market cap of the shares but would arguably significantly
    reduce the value of the shares.   

The
transfer of intellectual property is not in the normal course of business as we have purchased intellectual property to support
our venture into the medical technology field from shareholders. There was no substantive change in ownership interest of the
property as Mr. Paolucci and Mr. Karanovic continue to hold the majority equity position after the transaction. Accordingly, the
property should be valued at its carrying amount being $0 with the benefit conferred being $50,000 charged against additional
paid in capital.  

MANAGEMENT
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATIONS   

RESULTS
OF OPERATION   

The
financial information in the table above is derived from the quarterly unaudited financial statements. The following discussion
should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Current
Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs.
The Corporation s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors
that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this
Current Report on Form 10-Q. The financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with
United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  

Nine
Month Period Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Month Period Ended September 30, 2015.    

We
generated revenue during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 in the amount of $1,201,139 compared to $1,481,998 generated
during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 (a decrease of $280,859) Major components of the revenue mix for change
from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016 are as follows:  

a.  
      Prototypes
                                         Parts   increased $29,173_ for prototypes for Adient/JCI projects.   

b.  
      Spare
    Parts   decreased $173,394 for parts not required by many customers including JCI, Toyota, PWO  
    Kitchener, Van Rob   Mexico and M.I.G.   Athens to replace worn parts.   

c.  
      Retrofit
    Systems   decrease of $105,935.58. We assess old machines and recommend that specified work needs to be done
    on them. This includes all mechanical , electrical, hydraulic and pneumatics as required. We then replace worn parts on old
    benders   overhauled benders for JCI- Lakewood Bender #2, MIG-Athens, PWO - Kitchener, JCI-Athens and JCI-Ramos move
    machines for customers, install additional tooling units on existing benders. Retooling work primarily for in the second quarter
    of 2016 JCI Mexico and Constellium did not occur in the current period.   

d.  
      Seat
                                         Frame System   decrease of $67,434.56. There was one larger machine
                                         sold in Q1 of 2016.   

e.  
      Medical
    robotics, personal robotic devices and water treatment industry   We have not generated revenue from these sources as
    yet and will continue to investigate opportunities in these areas to augment its core business.   

Cost
of sales:  During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales was $751,820 compared to $974,819 during the
nine month period ended September 30, 2015 (a decrease of $222,999). The change in products sold in the nine month period ended
September 30, 2016 contributed to a decrease in our gross margin over the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. Ongoing
work for prototype parts and retrofit systems where the majority of the costs are borne by the customer assisted in offsetting
the lower product margins generated on the sale of seat frames in 2015. With the mix change as noted above being revenue primarily
for the much lower seat frame system, the cost of sales increased markedly in 2016 versus 2015.  

Gross
Profit.  Thus, based on the above, our gross profit decreased to $449,319 during the nine month period ended September 30,
2016 from $507,179 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  

Operating
expenses:  During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, we incurred operating expenses in the amount of $574,597
compared to operating expenses incurred during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 of $666,572 (a decrease of $91,975).
Operating expenses include: (i) compensation of $368,799 (2015: $445,469); (ii) occupancy costs of $51,592 (2015: $51,557); (iii)
travel of $27,102 (2015: $37,503); (iv) professional fees of $40,287 (2015: $101,019); (v) communication of $7,678 (2015: $8,768);
and (vi) office and general of $79,139 (2015: $22,256). In respect of compensation, less labor charges were capitalized to the
work in process projects during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine month period ended September
30, 2015 due to the timing and completion of specific projects resulting in a reduction of $76,670 being charged in 2016. Travel
decreased by $10,401 as we focused on acquiring new customers and opportunities locally during the nine month period ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Professional fees fell by $60,732 in the third quarter of 2016 as the additional
charges associated with the change in auditors during this time frame in 2015 did not recur. Office and general expenses increased
by $56,883 due to an accrual for factored receivable charges of approximately $30,000 which was not recorded in 2015.  

Income
from Operations.  Thus, this resulted in a loss before other income of ($125,278) during the nine month period ended September
30, 2016 compared to a loss before other income of ($159,393) during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  

Other
Income (Expense).   During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, we recorded
($29,256) in other expense as compared to $238,064 in other income in the nine month period ended September 30,
2015. The continued weakening Canadian dollar in 2016 against the United States dollar resulted during the nine month period September
30, 2016 in a foreign exchange loss of $61,057 compared to a gain of $164,538 during the nine month period ended September
30, 2015 on denominations transacted and settled in foreign currencies, primarily being sales to the United States from which
the monies are being converted and used to satisfy Canadian dollar operational requirements. We recovered $31,800 in expenses
associated with recovery of scientific research and development expenditures during the nine month period ended September 30,
2015 compared to $73,526 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.   

Net
income (loss).   Thus, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, this resulted
in net income (loss) of ($154,535) compared to net income of $78,671 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.   

Other Comprehensive Gain (Loss).
  During the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a foreign exchange adjustment of $950 as compared to ($268,442) during the nine month
period ended September 30, 2015.  

Comprehensive Loss.   Thus,
during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, our comprehensive loss was ($153,585) or ($0.00) per share compared
to a comprehensive loss of ($189,771) or ($0.27) for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The weighted average number
of shares outstanding was 34,218,577 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to 295,500 for the nine month
period ended September 30, 2015.  

Three
Month Period Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Month Period Ended September 30, 2015.    

We
generated revenue during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 in the amount of $53,619 compared to $467,642 generated
during the three month period ended September 30, 2015 (a decrease of $414,023). Major components of the revenue mix for change
from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016 are reflected above.  

Cost
of sales:  During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales was $44,159 compared to $407,186 during the
three month period ended September 30, 2015 (a decrease of $363,027). The change in products sold in the three month period ended
September 30, 2016 contributed to a decrease in our gross margin over the three month period ended September 30, 2015.  

Gross
Profit.  Thus, based on the above, our gross profit decreased to $9,460 during the three month period ended September 30, 2016
from $60,456 during the three month period ended September 30, 2015.  

Operating
expenses:  During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, we incurred operating expenses in the amount of $150,961
compared to operating expenses incurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2015 of $207,932 (a decrease of $56,971).
Operating expenses include: (i) compensation of $118,611 (2015: $128,960); (ii) occupancy costs of $15,779 (2015: $15,232); (iii)
travel of $8,628 (2015: $12,553); (iv) professional fees of $4,591 (2015: $31,794); (v) communication of $3,223 (2015: $3,126);
and (vi) office and general of $129 (2015: $16,267). In respect of compensation, less labor charges were capitalized to the work
in process projects during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three month period ended September
30, 2015. Professional fees decreased by $27,203 in 2016 as the additional charges associated with the change in auditors during
this time frame in 2015 did not recur. Office and general expenses increased by $16,138.  

Income
from Operations.  Thus, this resulted in a loss before other income of ($141,501) during the three month period ended September
30, 2016 compared to a loss before other income of ($147,476) during the three month period ended September 30, 2015.  

Other
Income.   During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $312,508
in other income as compared to $120,521 in other income in the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The continued weakening
Canadian dollar in 2016 against the United States dollar resulted during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 in a
foreign exchange gain of $280,707 compared to a gain of $121,936 during the three month period ended September 30, 2015
on denominations transacted and settled in foreign currencies, primarily being sales to the United States from which the monies
are being converted and used to satisfy Canadian dollar operational requirements. We recovered $31,800 in expenses associated
with recovery of scientific research and development expenditures during the three month period ended September 30, 2015 compared
to ($1,415) during the three month period ended September 30, 2016.   

Net
income (loss).   Thus, during the three month period ended September 30, 2016, this resulted
in net income of $171,007 compared to a net loss of ($26,955) during the three month period ended September 30, 2015.   

Other Comprehensive Gain (Loss).
  During the three month period
ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a foreign exchange adjustment of $315,658 as compared to ($168,980) during the three
month period ended September 30, 2015.  

Comprehensive Income (Loss).   Thus,
during the three month period ended September 30, 2016, our comprehensive gain was $486,665 or $0.00 per share compared
to a comprehensive loss of ($195,935) or ($0.09) for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The weighted average number
of shares outstanding was 49,295,500 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to 295,500 for the three month
period ended September 30, 2015.

We
expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and generation
of revenues. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.  

PLAN
OF OPERATION   

Our
principal demands for liquidity are to increase capacity, inventory purchase, sales distribution, and general corporate purposes.
We are in the process of being accepted as a global prototype supplier by Johnson Controls compared to our prior role as a supplier
for North America. We had been involved in discussions with Johnson Controls regarding prototypes and parts production. Johnson
Controls visited our facility during early 2012 to conduct an audit for global recommendation. Their goal was to understand the
processes we use to run the business and the controls that we have in place so that we were assured to have utmost control over
the quality of work. The audit was based on our employees and their qualifications, data management, processes, tooling and equipment
and parts and material management. Johnson Controls conducted a tour of our facility, which was followed up with a final review
on May 3, 2012. Subsequently we received a call from Johnson Controls stating that we had been accepted and recommended for their
global work. Therefore, we have been accepted for global work and thus provided the basis for previously disclosed projections.
We may achieve those revenue projections during fiscal year 2016, however, we may also not achieve that level of revenue.  

We
intend to meet our liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to the purchase of equipment, purchase of inventory,
and the expansion of its business, through cash flow provided by operations and funds raised through proceeds from the issuance
of debt or equity.  

With
a flexible labor force, workers are hired on a project by project basis, and strong inventory management, we are able to manage
our cash flow to meet the ever changing needs of the business. We can expand and contract very quickly based on customer demand.
Our major customers, JCI and Constellium, are consistently submitting new projects. We have $549,319. of project work in process
at the end of June 30, 2016 with a total contract value of approximately $1,900,025.00. We have received committed future orders
of over $487,034.00, which are anticipated to be completed during the second half of 2016. Other revenue opportunities have historically
materialized to supplement this revenue being service and retooling.  

We
have not paid any sums for public relations or investor relations.  

MATERIAL
COMMITMENTS   

Other
than the lease obligation and convertible notes described below, we have no other reportable material commitments for the nine
month period ended September 30, 2016.  

Lease   

We
entered into a lease to purchase equipment in November of 2015. An initial payment of $16,900 was made with the balance of the
lease to be satisfied in 36 equal monthly payments of approximately $820. The interest rate related to the lease obligation is
14% with a maturity date of November 2018 at which time the option exists to purchase the equipment for $4,600. Minimum lease
payments to maturity for fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 are as follows, respectively: (i) $2,755; (ii) $9,840;
and (iii) $9,020.  

Convertible
Notes   

On
August 26, 2016, Berardino Paolucci, our President/Chief Executive Officer, entered into those certain debt purchase agreements
dated August 26, 2016 (each, the  Debt Purchase Agreement ), which Debt Purchase Agreement was consummated on September
2, 2016 with payment of consideration.  

It
was previously reported and disclosed that we had issued: (i) that certain convertible promissory note dated December 15, 2006
in the principal amount of $60,000.00 (the  Treanor Convertible Note ), to Stephen Treanor ( Treanor ),
which a portion of the principal and accrued interest in the amount of $36,000 was subsequently settled pursuant to the terms
and provisions of that certain settlement agreement dated December 15, 2009 between us and Treanor (the  Treanor Settlement
Agreement ); (ii) that certain convertible promissory note dated April 15, 2008 in the principal amount of $40,000.00 (the
 Boyle Convertible Note ), to Donna Boyle ( Boyle ), which all the principal and accrued interest in the
amount of $41,600.00 was subsequently settled pursuant to the terms and provisions of that certain settlement agreement dated
December 15, 2009 between us and Boyle (the  Boyle Settlement Agreement ); and (iii) that certain convertible promissory
note dated December 15, 2006 in the principal amount of $60,000.00 (the  Russell Convertible Note ), to Raymond Russell
( Russell ), which a portion of the principal and accrued interest in the amount of $36,000 was subsequently settled
pursuant to the terms and provisions of that certain settlement agreement dated December 15, 2009 between us and Russell (the
 Russell Settlement Agreement ).  

It
was further previously disclosed that in accordance with the terms and provisions of that certain share exchange agreement dated
January 27, 2012 (the  Share Exchange Agreement ) between us and D Mecatronics Inc., a private corporation ( D
Mecatronics ) and the shareholders of D Mecatronics (the  D Mecatronics Shareholders ), we acquired all of the
total issued and outstanding shares of D Mecatronics in exchange for the issuance of shares of our common stock to the D Mecatronic
Shareholders and the assignment the Treanor Convertible Note, the Boyle Convertible Note and the Russell Convertible Note to Mr.
Paolucci.  

Debt
Purchase Agreements   

As
of the date of the Debt Purchase Agreements, the aggregate amount that remained due and owing under the Treanor Convertible Note,
the Boyle Convertible Note and the Russell Convertible Note was $39,864.00 (the  Debt ). Mr. Paolucci was the holder
of all right, title and interest in and to the Debt due and owing by us, which Debt is evidenced on the audited and reviewed financial
statements of the Company commencing as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, two separate unrelated parties
entered into a separate Debt Purchase Agreement with Mr. Paolucci for payment of consideration each in the amount of $12,500.00
(each, the  Purchase Price ) and Mr. Paolucci sold and transferred all of his respective right, title and interest,
including conversion rights of $0.005 per share, in and to the Debt.  

This debt was converted on October , 2016, 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES   

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations is based upon our interim consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). The preparation
of these interim financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate
our estimates including, among others, those affecting revenue, the allowance for doubtful accounts, the salability of inventory
and the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets. The discussion below is intended as a brief discussion of some of the
judgments and uncertainties that can impact the application of these policies and the specific dollar amounts reported on our
financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions, or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates. Many of our estimates or judgments are
based on anticipated future events or performance, and as such are forward-looking in nature, and are subject to many risks and
uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We do not undertake any obligation to
update or revise this discussion to reflect any future events or circumstances.  

Uses
of Estimates   

The
preparation of interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Financial statement items subject to significant judgment include expense accruals, as well as income
taxes and loss contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

The
areas which require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining carrying values include,
but are not limited to:  

Assets 
carrying values and impairment charges   

Assets,
including property and equipment and inventory, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that their carrying amount exceed their recoverable amounts. In the determination of carrying values and impairment charges, management
looks at the higher of recoverable amount or fair value less costs to sell in the case of assets and at objective evidence, significant
or prolonged decline of fair value on financial assets indicating impairment. These determinations and their individual assumptions
require that management make a decision based on the best available information at each reporting period.  

Income
taxes and recoverability of potential deferred tax assets    

In
assessing the probability of realizing income tax assets recognized, management makes estimates related to expectations of future
taxable income, applicable tax planning opportunities, expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the
likelihood that tax positions taken will be sustained upon examination by applicable tax authorities. In making its assessments,
management gives additional weight to positive and negative evidence that can be objectively verified. Estimates of future taxable
income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. The Company
considers whether relevant tax planning opportunities are within the Company s control, are feasible, and are within management s
ability to implement. Examination by applicable tax authorities is supported based on individual facts and circumstances of the
relevant tax position examined in light of all available evidence. Where applicable tax laws and regulations are either unclear
or subject to ongoing varying interpretations, it is reasonably possible that changes in these estimates can occur that materially
affect the amounts of income tax assets recognized. Also, future changes in tax laws could limit the Company from realizing the
tax benefits from the deferred tax assets. The Company reassesses unrecognized income tax assets at each reporting period. The
Company is current on its Canadian tax filings through  

  2015,
however is not current on its US tax filings.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

We
consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
At September 30, 2016, we had no cash equivalents. We maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts which may exceed federally insured
limits. As of September 30, 2016, our accounts are insured for $100,000 CDN by Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation for Canadian
bank deposits and are insured for $250,000 by FDIC for US bank deposits. The entirety of our US bank deposits are insured at September
30, 2016.  

Inventory   

Inventory,
comprised principally of raw materials, is stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO )
method. This policy requires D R to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventory, including an assessment of
excess or obsolete inventory. We determine excess and obsolete inventory based on an estimate of the future demand and estimated
selling prices for its products.  

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts   

We
extend credit to our customers in the normal course of business. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate
of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on specific customer
information, historical write-off experience and current industry and economic data. Account balances are charged-off against
the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. Management believes that there are no concentrations
of credit risk for which an allowance should be established. Although management believes that no allowance is needed, it is possible
that the estimated amount of cash collections with respect to accounts receivable could change. As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, we have not deemed any accounts uncollectible.  

Revenue
Recognition   

We
recognize revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements  ( SAB 101 ) as modified by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.104. Under
SAB 101, revenue is recognized when the project is complete, and when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.  

1.  
      Spare
    parts   Revenues and cost of sales are recognized at the time of sale.   

2.  
      Service
      Revenues and cost of sales are recognized at the time services are performed and accepted by customer via sign off.   

3.  
      Seat
    systems and tooling   progress invoicing to the customer are recorded as deferred revenue. When the projects are installed
    and accepted by the customer the final invoice is issued and all deferred revenue is recognized along with the related work
    in process costs for the project. Systems generally take 20-28 weeks to design, manufacture, assemble, and then ship to our
    various customers.   

D R provides standard warranties for its
product from the date of shipment. Estimated warranty obligations are recorded at the time of sale and amortized over the two
year warranty period as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, warranty liability was $12,290.64 and $10,654.74,
respectively. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Not
required for smaller reporting company.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

We
have performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  

Based
on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective:  

to
    give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
    Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and   

to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
    to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

We
believe that the foregoing steps will remediate the significant deficiencies identified above, and we will continue to monitor
the effectiveness of these steps and make any changes that our management deems appropriate. A material weakness (within the meaning
of PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those
responsible for oversight of the company s financial reporting.  

During
our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, management identified
significant deficiencies related to: (i) the absence of an Audit Committee as of September 30, 2016; and (ii) a lack of segregation
of duties within accounting functions.  

We
began preparing to be in compliance with the internal control obligations, including Section 404, for our fiscal year ending December
31, 2014. In an effort to improve our internal control environment, management has engaged a Chartered Accountant to review the
work prepared by the controller. He is independent of the daily accounting function. He prepares the quarterly financial statement
after reviewing and recommending adjustments to the records based on his analysis of the financial information presented. This
review includes vouching and reconciling key accounts to source documents.  

In
order to correct the foregoing weaknesses, we have taken certain further remediation measures and designed new internal controls
and procedures to ensure: (a) effectiveness and efficiency of operations; (b) reliability of financial reporting; and (c) compliance
with laws and regulations. To that end, management will provide a controlled environment which organizes and influences its people.  

(a)  
      Management
    is establishing an information and communication system for its executives and employees allowing them to carry out their
    responsibilities in an organized and process driven manner.   

(b)  
      The
    firm engaged the Chartered Accountant to assist with: (a) compiling and maintaining our financial records; (b) assisting the
    bookkeeping staff with proper recording of transactions; (c) maintaining permanent accounting records and proper backup procedures;
    and (d) providing continuous monitoring of accounting functions throughout the company. In addition, the Chartered Accountant
    will perform a risk assessment which identifies and analyzes the relevant risks management should address in order to achievement
    of its objectives. The Chartered Accountant will also assist with the preparation of written policies and procedures that
    will help ensure management directives are carried out.   

(c)  
      Our
    President/Chief Executive Officer is serving as the point of communication between us and the audit firm. Communication between
    our President/Chief Executive Officer and the audit firm s engagement partner has been established to ensure that the
    audit is aware of management s intent and actions.   

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including
the chief executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment,
no progress toward remediation of our previously disclosed material weaknesses has been implemented.  

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls   

We
believe that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives
of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance of achieving their objectives, and our CEO and our CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are not effective
at the  reasonable assurance  level.  

Changes
in internal controls   

There
were no changes in internal controls for the three month period ended September 30, 2016.  

AUDIT
COMMITTEE REPORT   

Our
Board of Directors has not established an audit committee. The respective role of an audit committee has been conducted by our
Board of Directors. We intend to establish an audit committee during fiscal year 2016. When established, the audit committee s
primary function will be to provide advice with respect to our financial matters and to assist our Board of Directors in fulfilling
its oversight responsibilities regarding finance, accounting, and legal compliance. The audit committee s primary duties
and responsibilities will be to: (i) serve as an independent and objective party to monitor our financial reporting process and
internal control system; (ii) review and appraise the audit efforts of our independent accountants; (iii) evaluate our quarterly
financial performance as well as its compliance with laws and regulations; (iv) oversee management s establishment and enforcement
of financial policies and business practices; and (v) provide an open avenue of communication among the independent accountants,
management and our Board of Directors.

Technology
Purchase Agreement   

On
March 15, 2016 and in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Technology Purchase Agreement, our Board of Directors authorized
the issuance of an aggregate 500,000 shares of our Series B preferred stock and 24,500,000 post-Reverse Stock Split shares of
restricted common stock to each of Berardino Paolucci, our President/Chief Executive Officer, and Drasko Karanovic.  

The
shares were valued at par and issued in a private transaction to the two non-United States residents in reliance on Regulation
S promulgated under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). None of the shares
have been registered under the Securities Act or under any state securities laws and, therefore, may not be offered or sold without
registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.  

Cancellation
of Shares   

Our
Board of Directors has been advised by our current auditors that at the time of financial accounting and treatment of consummation
of the Share Exchange Agreement, there were inaccuracies regarding the amounts recorded due and owing under the Russell Convertible
Note, the Treanor Convertible Note and the Boyle Convertible Note and hence the amounts that we were still contractually obligated
on the respective notes were also incorrect. Therefore, Mr. Paolucci has returned to the transfer agent his share certificate
evidencing the issuance of the 22,720,000 pre-Reverse Stock Split shares of restricted common stock and, as reduced to 75,733
shares of common stock per the Reverse Stock Split, returned the 75,733 shares to treasury.
