Note 1.     Organization, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, Acquisitions and Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  We are an emerging leader in the field of personalized medicine, enabling precision medicine in the field of oncology through our diagnostic products and services and molecular markers. We develop, commercialize and provide molecular- and biomarker-based tests and services that enable physicians to personalize the clinical management of each individual patient by providing genomic information to better diagnose, monitor and inform cancer treatment and that enable biopharmaceutical companies engaged in oncology trials to better select candidate populations and reduce adverse drug reactions by providing information regarding genomic factors influencing subject responses to therapeutics. We have a comprehensive, disease-focused oncology testing portfolio. Our tests and techniques target a wide range of cancers, covering eight of the top ten cancers in prevalence in the United States, with additional unique capabilities offered by our Tissue of Origin  test for identifying difficult to diagnose tumor types or poorly differentiated metastatic disease.           
  We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 8, 1999 and have offices and state-of-the-art laboratories located in California, New Jersey, North Carolina, Shanghai (China), and Hyderabad (India). Our laboratories comply with the highest regulatory standards as appropriate for the services they deliver including CLIA, CAP, NY State, California State and NABL (India). Our services are built on a foundation of world-class scientific knowledge and intellectual property in solid and blood-borne cancers, as well as strong academic relationships with major cancer centers such as Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Mayo Clinic, and the National Cancer Institute. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions for interim reporting as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary to make the financial statements not misleading have been included. As such, the information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 10, 2016. The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , included herein was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date, but does not include all disclosures including notes required by GAAP. Interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future interim period or for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  Liquidity and Going Concern 
    
  We believe that our current cash will support operations for at least the next   6   to   9   months. We are exploring opportunities for additional equity or debt financing, and we are taking steps to improve our operating cash flow. We can provide no assurances that our current actions will be successful or that any additional sources of financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all, when needed. Our forecast of the period of time through which our current financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and the costs to support our general and administrative, sales and marketing and research and development activities are forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties. 
    
  The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary debt and/or equity financing to continue operations. These interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
    
  Acquisition of Response Genetics, Inc.  
    
  On October 9, 2015, we acquired substantially all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Response Genetics, Inc. ( Response Genetics ), with its principal place of business in California, in a transaction valued at approximately   $12.9 million  , comprised of   $7.5 million   in cash and   788,584   shares of the Company s common stock, with the common stock being valued at   $5.4 million  .

     Table of Contents  

The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   include the operations of Response Genetics, which accounted for approximately   $2,003,000   and   $6,210,000   of the Company s consolidated revenue, respectively. The net loss of Response Genetics cannot be determined, as its operations are integrated with Cancer Genetics.  
    
  2016 Offerings 
    
  May Offering 
    
  On May 25, 2016, we sold   2,467,820   shares of common stock in a public offering and warrants to purchase   1,233,910   shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement. These offerings resulted in gross proceeds of   $5 million  . We sold   2,150,000   shares of common stock and warrants to purchase   1,075,000   shares of common stock to certain institutional investors at a combined offering price of   $2.00   per common share, and our Chairman of the Board, John Pappajohn, purchased   317,820   shares of common stock and warrants to purchase   158,910   shares of common stock at a combined offering price of   $2.2025   per common share. In addition, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of   123,391   shares of common stock to the placement agent. Subject to certain ownership limitations, the warrants will be initially exercisable commencing   six months   from the issuance date at an exercise price equal to   $2.25   per share of common stock. The warrants are exercisable for   five years   from the initial exercise date. All references to the sales of common stock and warrants mentioned in this paragraph are referred to as the  May Offering.  
    
  September Offering 
    
  On September 14, 2016, we sold   2,750,000   shares of common stock in a public offering and warrants to purchase   1,375,000   shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement at a combined price of   $2.00   per common share. These offerings resulted in gross proceeds of   $5.5   million. In addition, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of   137,500   shares of common stock to the placement agent. Subject to certain ownership restrictions, the warrants will be initially exercisable six months from the issuance date at an exercise price of   $2.25   per share of common stock. The warrants are exercisable for   five years   from the initial exercise date. All references to the sales of common stock and warrants mentioned in this paragraph are referred to as the  September Offering,  and collectively with the May Offering, the  2016 Offerings.  
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This standard requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid in capital pools. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. The guidance is effective in 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption. 

Note 2.     Revenue and Accounts Receivable 
    
  Revenue by service type for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is comprised of the following (in thousands):    

The table above includes approximately   $522,000   of biopharma revenue and approximately   $1,481,000   of clinical services revenue from our acquisition of Response Genetics for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The table above includes approximately   $1,600,000   of biopharma revenue and approximately   $4,610,000   of clinical services revenue from our acquisition of Response Genetics for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Accounts receivable by service type at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consists of the following (in thousands):

     Table of Contents  

Revenue for Biopharma Services are customized solutions for patient stratification and treatment selection through an extensive suite of DNA-based testing services. Clinical Services are tests performed to provide information on diagnosis, prognosis and theranosis of cancers to guide patient management. These tests can be billed to Medicare, another third party insurer or the referring community hospital or other healthcare facility. Discovery Services are services that provide the tools and testing methods for companies and researchers seeking to identify new DNA-based biomarkers for disease. The breakdown of our Clinical Services revenue (as a percent of total revenue) is as follows: 

We have historically derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of test ordering sites. Test ordering sites account for all of our Clinical Services and Biopharma Services revenue. Our test ordering sites are largely hospitals, cancer centers, reference laboratories, physician offices and biopharmaceutical companies. Oncologists and pathologists at these sites order the tests on behalf of the needs of their oncology patients or as part of a clinical trial sponsored by a biopharmaceutical company in which the patient is being enrolled. We generally do not have formal, long-term written agreements with such test ordering sites, and, as a result, we may lose a significant test ordering site at any time. 
    
  The top five test ordering sites during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   accounted for   39%   and   59%  , respectively, of our testing volumes, with   6%   and   27%  , respectively, of the volume coming from community hospitals. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , there was   one   biopharmaceutical company which accounted for approximately   18%   of our total revenue. During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , there were   two   biopharmaceutical companies which accounted for approximately   15%   and   11%   of our total revenue, respectively.  
    
  The top five test ordering sites during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   accounted for   31%   and   80%   respectively, of our testing volumes, with   7%   and   31%  , respectively, of the volume coming from community hospitals. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there was   one   biopharmaceutical company which accounted for approximately   10%   of our total revenue. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , there were   two   biopharmaceutical companies which accounted for approximately   23%   and   11%   of our total revenue, respectively.  

Note 3.     Earnings Per Share 
    
  For purposes of this calculation, stock warrants, outstanding stock options and unvested restricted shares are considered common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method, and are the only such equivalents outstanding. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, all common stock equivalents outstanding were anti-dilutive. 
    
  The following table summarizes equivalent units outstanding that were excluded from the earnings per share calculation because their effects were anti-dilutive (in thousands):

Note 4. Lease Commitments 
    
  We lease our laboratory, research facility and administrative office space under various operating leases. In June 2016, we amended the lease for our Los Angeles, California location. The term of the updated lease is   18 months  , expires December 31, 2017, requires monthly payments of approximately   $54,000   and reduces our facilities in this location to   19,100   square feet.  
    
  Minimum future lease payments under all capital and operating leases as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows (in thousands): 

Note 5. Bank Term Note and Line of Credit 
    
  On May 7, 2015, we entered into a debt financing facility with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB ). The SVB credit facility provides for a   $6.0 million   term note ( Term Note ) and a revolving line of credit ( Line of Credit ) for an amount not to exceed the lesser of (i)   $4.0 million   or (ii) an amount equal to   80%   of eligible accounts receivable. The Term Note requires interest-only payments through April 30, 2016 and beginning May 1, 2016, monthly principal payments of approximately   $167,000   will be required plus interest through maturity on   April 1, 2019  . The interest rate of the Term Note is the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus   2%  , with a floor of   5.25%   (  5.50%   at   September 30, 2016  ) and an additional deferred interest payment of   $180,000   will be due upon maturity. The Line of Credit requires monthly interest-only payments of the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus   1.5%   (  5.00%   at   September 30, 2016  ) and matures on   May 7, 2017  . The loan agreement requires maintenance of certain financial ratios and grants SVB a first security interest in substantially all Company assets (other than our intellectual property). At   September 30, 2016   the principal balance of the Term Note was approximately   $5,167,000   and the principal balance of the Line of Credit was   $0  .  On January 28, 2016, the Line of Credit was amended with SVB and we are no longer able to draw on the Line of Credit until we raise approximately   $2.5   million of additional equity. 
    
  The following is a summary of long-term debt (in thousands):

Note 6. Capital Stock 
    
  2016 Offerings 
    
  May Offering 
    
  On May 25, 2016, we sold   2,467,820   shares of common stock in a public offering and warrants to purchase   1,233,910   shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement. These offerings resulted in gross proceeds of   $5 million  . We sold   2,150,000   shares of common stock and warrants to purchase   1,075,000   shares of common stock to certain institutional investors at a combined offering price of   $2.00   per common share, and our Chairman of the Board, John Pappajohn, purchased   317,820   shares of common stock and warrants to purchase   158,910   shares of common stock at a combined offering price of   $2.2025   per common share. In addition, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of   123,391   shares of common stock to the placement agent. Subject to certain ownership limitations, the warrants will be initially exercisable commencing   six months   from the issuance date at an exercise price equal to   $2.25   per share of common stock. The warrants are exercisable for   five years   from the initial exercise date.  
    
  September Offering 
    
  On September 14, 2016, we sold   2,750,000   shares of common stock in a public offering and warrants to purchase   1,375,000   shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement at a combined price of   $2.00   per common share. These offerings resulted in gross proceeds of   $5.5   million. In addition, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of   137,500   shares of common stock to the placement agent. Subject to certain ownership restrictions, the warrants will be initially exercisable six months from the issuance date at an exercise price of   $2.25   per share of common stock. The warrants are exercisable for   five years   from the initial exercise date.  

Note 7. Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  We have   two   equity incentive plans: the 2008 Stock Option Plan (the  2008 Plan ) and the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2011 Plan , and together with the 2008 Plan, the  Stock Option Plans ). The Stock Option Plans are meant to provide additional incentive to officers, employees and consultants to remain in our employment. Options granted are generally exercisable for up to   10 years  . On October 11, 2016, the stockholders voted to amend the 2011 Plan and increase the number of shares reserved by the 2011 Plan to   3,150,000   shares of common stock. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   686,897   shares remain available for future awards under the 2011 Plan (not including the effects of the October 11, 2016 amendment to the 2011 Plan) and   112,055   shares remain available for future awards under the 2008 Plan. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   stock appreciation rights and   275,500   shares of restricted stock have been awarded under the Stock Option Plans. 
    
  A summary of employee and non-employee stock option activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is as follows: 
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

In October 2016, the Company granted employees incentive stock options to purchase   43,000   shares of the Company s common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of   $1.70   per share. 
    
  On October 11, 2016 the Company granted its non-employee directors   2,500   restricted shares each of the Company s common stock and options to purchase an aggregate of   10,000   shares each of the Company s common stock as compensation for serving on the Board of Directors.  
    
  Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the estimated fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of outstanding, in-the-money options.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted to employees was   $3,346,608   which we expect to recognize over the next   2.47   years. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted to non-employees was   $35,625   which we expect to recognize over the next   1.25   years. The estimate of unrecognized non-employee compensation is based on the fair value of the non-vested options as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The fair value of options granted to employees is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This valuation model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the expected term (the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the volatility of our common stock, a risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. To the extent actual forfeitures differ from the estimates, the difference will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. No compensation cost is recorded for options that do not vest. We use the simplified calculation of expected life described in the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107,   Share-Based Payment  , and volatility is based on an average of the historical volatilities of the common stock of three entities with characteristics similar to those of the Company. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option. We use an expected dividend yield of zero, as we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Expected forfeitures are assumed to be zero due to the small number of plan participants and the plan design which has monthly vesting after an initial cliff vesting period.

Note 8. Warrants 
    
  On May 25, 2016, we issued   1,357,301   warrants to purchase shares of our common stock as part of our May Offering. Subject to certain ownership limitations, the warrants will be initially exercisable commencing   six months   from the issuance date at an exercise price equal to   $2.25   per share of common stock. The warrants are exercisable for   five years   from the initial exercise date. These warrants contain a contingent net cash settlement feature and are described as derivative warrants. 
    
  On September 14, 2016, we issued   1,512,500   warrants to purchase shares of our common stock as part of our September Offering. Subject to certain ownership limitations, the warrants will be initially exercisable commencing   six months   from the issuance date at an exercise price equal to   $2.25   per share of common stock. The warrants are exercisable for   five years   from the initial exercise date. These warrants also contain a contingent net cash settlement feature and are described as derivative warrants. 
    
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we expensed   $325,000   of offering costs associated with the derivative warrants issued in the 2016 Offerings. These costs are included in other expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Note 10. Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification requires the use of valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach and/or the cost approach. Inputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Inputs may be observable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources, or unobservable, meaning those that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. In that regard, the Topic establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that give the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: 
    
  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access as of the measurement date. 
    
  Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
    
  Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
    
  The following table summarizes the financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis segregated by the level of valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value (in thousands): 

The ultimate payment to VenturEast will be the value of   84,278   shares of common stock at the time of payment. The value of the note payable to VenturEast was determined using the fair value of our common stock less a discount for credit risk. During

     Table of Contents  

the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized a gain of approximately   $18,000   and   $119,000  , respectively, due to the change in value of the note. 
    
  At September 30, 2016, the warrant liability consists of stock warrants issued as part of the 2016 Offerings that contain contingent redemption features. At December 31, 2015, the warrant liability consisted of stock warrants that contained an exercise price adjustment feature. In accordance with derivative accounting for warrants, we calculated the fair value of these warrants, and the assumptions used are described in Note 9,  Fair Value of Warrants.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized a gain of approximately   $712,000   on the warrants issued as part of the 2016 Offerings due to the decrease in our stock price. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we also recognized a gain of approximately   $17,000   due to the expiration of the derivative warrants outstanding at December 31, 2015. 
    
  Realized and unrealized gains and losses related to the change in fair value of the VenturEast note and warrant liability are included in other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  The following table summarizes the activity of the notes payable to VenturEast and the warrant liability, which were measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs (in thousands): 

Note 11. Joint Venture Agreement 
    
  In   November 2011  , we entered into an affiliation agreement with the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research ( Mayo ), subsequently amended. Under the agreement, we formed a joint venture with Mayo in May 2013 to focus on developing oncology diagnostic services and tests utilizing next generation sequencing. The joint venture is a limited liability company, with each party initially holding   fifty percent   of the issued and outstanding membership interests of the new entity (the  JV ). In exchange for our membership interest in the JV, we made an initial capital contribution of   $1.0 million   in October 2013. In addition, we issued   10,000   shares of our common stock to Mayo pursuant to our affiliation agreement and recorded an expense of approximately   $175,000  . We also recorded additional expense of approximately   $231,000   during the fourth quarter of 2013 related to shares issued to Mayo in November 2011 as the JV achieved certain performance milestones. In the third quarter of 2014, we made an additional   $1.0 million   capital contribution. 
    
  The agreement also requires aggregate total capital contributions by us of up to an additional   $4.0 million  . We may make capital contributions up to   $1.0 million   in 2017. The timing of the remaining installments is subject to the JV's achievement of certain operational milestones agreed upon by the board of governors of the JV. In exchange for its membership interest, Mayo s capital contribution takes the form of cash, staff, services, hardware and software resources, laboratory space and instrumentation, the fair market value of which will be approximately equal to   $6.0 million  . Mayo s continued contribution will also be conditioned upon the JV s achievement of certain milestones.  
    
  Our share of the JV s net loss was approximately $  18,000   and $  343,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   $45,000   and $  748,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and is included in research and development expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have a net receivable due from the JV of approximately   $10,000   at   September 30, 2016  , which is included in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  The joint venture is considered a variable interest entity under ASC 810-10, but we are not the primary beneficiary as we do not have the power to direct the activities of the JV that most significantly impact its performance. Our evaluation of ability to impact performance is based on our equal board membership and voting rights and day-to-day management functions which are performed by the Mayo personnel.

  Overview 
    
  We are an emerging leader in the field of personalized medicine, enabling precision medicine in the field of oncology through our diagnostic products and services and molecular markers. We develop, commercialize and provide molecular- and biomarker-based tests and services that enable physicians to personalize the clinical management of each individual patient by providing genomic information to better diagnose, monitor and inform cancer treatment and that enable biopharmaceutical companies engaged in oncology trials to better select candidate populations and reduce adverse drug reactions by providing information regarding genomic factors influencing subject responses to therapeutics. We have a comprehensive, disease- 
  
   14 

     Table of Contents  

focused oncology testing portfolio. Our tests and techniques target a wide range of cancers, covering eight of the top ten cancers in prevalence in the United States, with additional unique capabilities offered by our Tissue of Origin  test for identifying difficult to diagnose tumor types or poorly differentiated metastatic disease.          
  Our vision is to become the oncology diagnostics partner for biopharmaceutical companies and clinicians by participating in the entire care continuum from bench to bedside. We believe the diagnostics industry is undergoing a rapid evolution in its approach to oncology testing, embracing precision medicine and individualized testing as a means to drive higher standards of patient treatment and disease management. Similarly, biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly engaging companies such as ours to provide information on clinical trial participants' molecular profiles in order to identify biomarker and genomic variations that may be responsible for differing responses to pharmaceuticals, and particularly to oncology drugs, thereby increasing the efficiency of trials while lowering related costs. We believe tailored therapeutics can revolutionize oncology medicine through molecular- and biomarker-based testing services, enabling physicians and researchers to target the factors that make each patient and disease unique. We have created a unique position in the industry by providing targeted somatic analysis of tumor sample cells alongside germline analysis of an individual's non-cancerous cells' molecular profile as we attempt to reach the next milestone in personalized medicine. Individuals are born with germline mutations, and somatic mutations arise in tissues over the course of a lifetime. 
    
  Our services are performed at our state-of-the-art laboratories located in New Jersey, North Carolina, California, Shanghai (China), and Hyderabad, India. Our laboratories comply with the highest regulatory standards as appropriate for the services they deliver including CLIA, CAP, NY State, California State and NABL (India). Our services are built on a foundation of world-class scientific knowledge and intellectual property in solid and blood-borne cancers, as well as strong academic relationships with major cancer centers such as Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Mayo Clinic, and the National Cancer Institute. 
    
  Our clinical offerings include our portfolio of proprietary tests targeting hematological, urogenital and HPV-associated cancers, in conjunction with ancillary non-proprietary tests. Our proprietary tests target cancers that are difficult to prognose and predict treatment outcomes through currently available mainstream techniques. We provide our proprietary tests and services, along with a comprehensive range of non-proprietary oncology-focused tests and laboratory services, to oncologists and pathologists at hospitals, cancer centers, and physician offices, as well as biotech and pharmaceutical companies to support their clinical trials. Our proprietary tests are based principally on our expertise in specific cancer types, test development methodologies and proprietary algorithms correlating genetic events with disease specific information. Our portfolio primarily includes comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarrays and next generation sequencing (NGS) panels, and DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probes. 
    
  The non-proprietary testing services we offer are focused in part on specific oncology categories where we are developing our proprietary tests. We believe that there is significant synergy in developing and marketing a complete set of tests and services that are disease focused and delivering those tests and services in a comprehensive manner to help with treatment decisions. 
    
  The insight that we develop in delivering the non-proprietary services are often leveraged in the development of our proprietary programs and now increasingly in the validation of our proprietary programs, such as MatBA and Focus::NGS. 
    
  We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the near future. We incurred losses of $20.2 million and $16.6 million for fiscal years ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, and   $13.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an accumulated deficit of   $111.2 million  .  
    
  Acquisitions 
   On October 9, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Response Genetics, Inc. ( Response Genetics ), now referred to as CGI West, with its principal place of business in California, for aggregate consideration of approximately $12.9 million.   
    
  Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
    
  Our overall long-term growth plan is predicated on our ability to develop and commercialize our proprietary tests, penetrate the Biopharma community to achieve more revenue supporting clinical trials and develop and penetrate the Indian market. Our proprietary tests include CGH microarrays, NGS panels, and DNA FISH probes.We continue to develop additional proprietary tests. To facilitate market adoption of our proprietary tests, we anticipate having to successfully complete additional studies with clinical samples and publish our results in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Our ability to complete such studies is  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

dependent upon our ability to leverage our collaborative relationships with leading institutions to facilitate our research and obtain data for our quality assurance and test validation efforts. 
    
  We believe that the factors discussed in the following paragraphs have had and are expected to continue to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  Revenues 
    
  Our revenue is primarily generated through our Clinical Services and Biopharma Services. Clinical Services can be billed to Medicare, another third party insurer or the referring community hospital or other healthcare facility in accordance with state and federal law. Biopharma Services are billed to the customer directly. While we have agreements with our Biopharma clients, volumes from these clients are subject to the progression and continuation of the trials which can impact testing volume. We also derive limited revenue from Discovery Services, which are services provided in the development of new testing assays and methods. Discovery Services are billed directly to the customer. 
    
  We have historically derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of test ordering sites, although the test ordering sites that generate a significant portion of our revenue have changed from period to period. Test ordering sites account for all of our Clinical Services revenue along with a portion of the Biopharma Services revenue. Our test ordering sites are hospitals, cancer centers, reference laboratories, physician offices and biopharmaceutical companies. Oncologists and pathologists at these sites order the tests on behalf of the needs of their oncology patients or as part of a clinical trial sponsored by a biopharmaceutical company in which the patient is being enrolled.           
  The top five test ordering clients during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   accounted for   39%   and   59%  , respectively, of our testing volumes, with   6%   and   27%  , respectively, of the test volume coming from community hospitals. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   one   Biopharma client accounted for approximately   18%   of our revenue. During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,   two   Biopharma clients accounted for approximately   15%   and   11%   of our revenue, respectively.  
    
  The top five test ordering clients during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   accounted for   31%   and   80%  , respectively, of our testing volumes, with   7%   and   31%  , respectively, of the test volume coming from community hospitals. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   one   Biopharma client accounted for approximately   10%   of our revenue. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   two   Biopharma clients accounted for approximately   23%   and   11%   of our revenue, respectively.  
    
  We receive revenue for our Clinical Services from Medicare, other insurance carriers and other healthcare facilities.  Some of our customers choose, generally at the beginning of our relationship, to pay for laboratory services directly as opposed to having patients (or their insurers) pay for those services and providing us with the patients  insurance information.  A hospital may elect to be a direct bill customer and pay our bills directly, or may provide us with patient information so that their patients pay our bills, in which case we generally expect payment from their private insurance carrier or Medicare. In a few instances, we have arrangements where a hospital may have two accounts with us, so that certain tests are billed directly to the hospital, and certain tests are billed to and paid by a patient s insurer. The billing arrangements generally are dictated by our customers and in accordance with state and federal law.           
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , Medicare accounted for approximately   14%   of our total revenue, other insurance accounted for approximately   21%   of our total revenue and other healthcare facilities accounted for   5%   of our total revenue. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Medicare accounted for approximately   13%   of our total revenue, other insurance accounted for approximately   20%   of our total revenue and other healthcare facilities accounted for   6%   of our total revenue. On average, we generate less revenue per test from other healthcare facilities billed directly, than from other insurance payers.   
    
  Cost of Revenues 
    
  Our cost of revenues consists principally of internal personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, laboratory consumables, shipping costs, overhead and other direct expenses, such as specimen procurement and third party validation studies. We are pursuing various strategies to reduce and control our cost of revenues, including automating our processes through more efficient technology and attempting to negotiate improved terms with our suppliers. We completed two acquisitions in 2014; Gentris in North Carolina and BioServe in India. In 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Response Genetics in California. With these three acquisitions, we have made significant progress with integrating our  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

resources and services in an effort to reduce costs. We will continue to assess how geographic advantage can help us improve our cost structure. 
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  We classify our operating expenses into three categories: research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. Our operating expenses principally consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, outside services, laboratory consumables and overhead, development costs, marketing program costs and legal and accounting fees. 
    
  Research and Development Expenses.  We incur research and development expenses principally in connection with our efforts to develop our proprietary tests. Our primary research and development expenses consist of direct personnel costs, laboratory equipment and consumables and overhead expenses. In 2013, we entered into a joint venture with the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, with a focus on developing oncology diagnostic services and tests utilizing next generation sequencing. All research and development expenses are charged to operations in the periods they are incurred. 
    
  General and Administrative Expenses.   General and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related expenses, professional fees, such as legal, accounting and business consultants, occupancy costs, bad debt and other general expenses. We have incurred increases in our general and administrative expenses and anticipate further increases as we expand our business operations. 
    
  Sales and Marketing Expenses  . Our sales and marketing expenses consist principally of personnel and related overhead costs for our sales team and their support personnel, travel and entertainment expenses, and other selling costs including sales collaterals and trade shows. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we expand into new geographies and add new clinical tests and services. 
    
  Seasonality 
    
  Our business experiences decreased demand during spring vacation season, summer months and the December holiday season when patients are less likely to visit their health care providers. We expect this trend in seasonality to continue for the foreseeable future. 
    
  Results of Operations 
    
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  The following table sets forth certain information concerning our results of operations for the periods shown:    

Revenue 
    
  The breakdown of our revenue is as follows: 
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  

Revenue increased   69%  , or   $2.7 million  , to   $6.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $4.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , principally due to the acquisition of CGI West, whose revenue accounted for $2.0 million of the increase; an increase of $0.7 million in Biopharma and an increase of $0.1 million in Clinical Services from our other locations. The acquired business consisted of $1.5 million in Clinical Services and $0.5 million in Biopharma Services. Our average revenue (excluding probe revenue) per test decreased to $397 per test for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from $612 per test for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , principally due to the additional Clinical Services revenue from our acquisition of CGI West. Clinical Services revenue has a lower per test rate than Biopharma Services. Test volume increased by 236% from 3,676 tests for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to 12,348 tests for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Revenue from Biopharma Services increased   46%  , or   $1.2 million  , to   $3.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $2.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , due to the revenue from our acquisition of CGI West, which accounted for $0.5 million of the increase, and an increase of $0.7 million at our other locations. Revenue from Clinical Services customers increased by   $1.5 million  , or   134%  , due to the revenue from our acquisition of CGI West, which accounted for $1.4 million of the increase, and an increase $0.1 million at our other locations.  
    
  Cost of Revenues 
    
  Cost of revenues increased   43%  , or   $1.3 million  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , principally due to the costs of revenue from CGI West of $1.1 million and an increase in lab supplies in our other locations of $0.3 million as a result of increased volume and revenues, partially offset by a $0.2 million reduction in compensation, as a result of the Company s focus on reducing cost and improving gross margin. Gross margin improved to 34% during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from 22% during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , due to cost reduction initiatives and synergies across locations.

  Research and development expenses decreased   12%  , or $  0.2 million  , to $  1.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from $  1.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , principally due to the following: a $0.3 million decrease in our share of the loss from Oncospire, our joint venture with the Mayo Clinic; a decrease in our R D expenditure of $0.3 million and a decrease of $0.1 million in compensation; partially offset by our validation projects (supplies and labor) at CGI West of $0.5 million.  
    
  General and administrative expenses increased   6%  , or   $0.2 million  , to   $3.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $3.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , principally due to the costs from the acquired business, CGI West, of $0.9 million. This increase was partially offset by the following: a decrease in compensation of $0.4 million; a decrease of $0.1 million in audit fees and a decrease in stock-based compensation of $0.2 million. 
    
  Sales and marketing expenses decreased   15%  , or   $0.2 million  , to   $1.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $1.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , principally due to decreased compensation costs of $0.2 million and decreased travel costs of $0.1 million, partially offset by the cost from the acquired business, CGI West, of $0.2 million. 
    
  Interest Income (Expense) 
    
  Net interest expense remained consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
    
  Change in Fair Value of Acquisition Note Payable 

18 

     Table of Contents  

The change in fair value of note payable resulted in approximately   $18,000   and   $0.3 million   in non-cash income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The fair value of the note representing part of the purchase price for BioServe decreased as a consequence of a decrease in our stock price. 
    
  Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 
    
  Changes in fair value of some of our common stock warrants may impact our quarterly results.  Accounting rules require us to record certain of our warrants as a liability, measure the fair value of these warrants each quarter and record changes in that value in earnings. As a result of a decrease in our stock price, we recognized non-cash income of $  0.7 million   and   $0.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  In the future, if our stock price increases, we would record a non-cash charge as a result of changes in the fair value of our common stock warrants.  Consequently, we may be exposed to non-cash charges, or we may record non-cash income, as a result of this warrant exposure in future periods. 
    
  Other Expense 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we expensed   $0.3 million   of offering costs associated with the derivative warrants issued in the 2016 Offerings. 
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  The following table sets forth certain information concerning our results of operations for the periods shown:  

Revenue 
    
  The breakdown of our revenue is as follows: 

Revenue increased   58%  , or   $7.3 million  , to   $19.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $12.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , principally due to the acquisition of CGI West, whose revenue accounted for $6.2 million of the increase. The acquired business consisted of $4.6 million in Clinical Services and $1.6 million in Biopharma Services. There was also an increase of $1.2 million in Biopharma Services at our other locations and an increase of $0.1 million in our Discovery Services, partially offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in our Clinical Services at our other locations. Our average revenue (excluding probe revenue) per test decreased to $408 per test for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from $600 per test for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , principally due to the additional Clinical Services revenue from our acquisition of CGI West. Clinical Services revenue has a lower per test rate than Biopharma Services. Test  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

volume increased by 218% from 11,378 tests for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to 36,156 tests for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Revenue from Biopharma Services increased   32%  , or   $2.8 million  , to   $11.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $8.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , due to the revenue from our acquisition of CGI West, which accounted for $1.6 million of the increase, and an increase of $1.2 million from our other locations. Revenue from Clinical Services customers increased by   $4.4 million  , or   135%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to the revenue from our acquisition of CGI West, which accounted for $4.6 million of the increase, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $0.2 million at our other locations.  
    
  Cost of Revenues 
    
  Cost of revenues increased   37%  , or   $3.5 million  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , principally due to the costs of revenue from CGI West of $4.2 million; increases at our locations in lab supplies of $0.2 million, shipping costs of $0.3 million, and stock based compensation of $0.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a $0.8 million reduction in compensation and a $0.4 million reduction in outsourced services. These reductions were a result of the Company's focus on reducing cost and improving gross margin. Gross margin improved to 35% during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from 26% during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , due to cost reduction initiatives.  
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  Research and development expenses increased   11%  , or   $0.5 million  , to   $4.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $4.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , principally due to the following: validation projects at CGI West as well as our existing locations. This initiative saw increases in costs of $1.2 million at our California location and $0.5 million at our other locations for labor and lab supplies. These increases were partially offset by the following: a $0.7 million decrease in our share of the loss from Oncospire, our joint venture with the Mayo Clinic; a reduction in stock based compensation of $0.2 million and a reduction of $0.3 million in our R D projects expenditure. 
    
  General and administrative expenses increased   22%  , or   $2.1 million  , to   $11.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $9.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , principally due to the following: costs from the acquired business, CGI West, of $2.5 million and increased insurance, legal, licenses and information technology costs as a result of our expanded operations of $0.9 million. These increases were partially offset by the following: a reduction of $0.2 million in audit fees; a reduction of $0.2 million in the bad debt allowance; a reduction of $0.2 million in public relations costs; a reduction of $0.5 million in stock based compensation costs and a reduction of $0.2 million in recruiting and medical billing costs. 
    
  Sales and marketing expenses increased   5%  , or   $0.2 million  , to   $3.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $3.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , principally due to increased costs from CGI West of $0.9 million, partially offset by the following: a reduction of compensation of $0.4 million and a reduction of $0.3 million in consulting, recruiting and travel and entertainment. 
    
  Interest Income (Expense) 
    
  Net interest expense increased   64%  , or   $0.1 million  , principally due to the higher interest rate related to the debt we refinanced in May 2015. 
    
  Change in Fair Value of Acquisition Note Payable 
    
  The change in fair value of note payable resulted in   $0.1 million   in non-cash income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to non-cash expense of   $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The fair value of the note representing part of the purchase price for BioServe decreased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as a consequence of a decrease in our stock price. 
    
  Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 
    
  Changes in fair value of some of our common stock warrants may impact our quarterly results.  Accounting rules require us to record certain of our warrants as a liability, measure the fair value of these warrants each quarter and record changes in that value in earnings. As a result of a decrease in our stock price, we recognized non-cash income of   $0.7 million   and   $18,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. In the future, if our stock price increases, we would record a  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

non-cash charge as a result of changes in the fair value of our common stock warrants.  Consequently, we may be exposed to non-cash charges, or we may record non-cash income, as a result of this warrant exposure in future periods. 
    
  Other Expense 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we expensed   $0.3 million   of offering costs associated with the derivative warrants issued in the 2016 Offerings. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Sources of Liquidity 
    
  Our primary sources of liquidity have been funds generated from our debt financings and equity financings. In addition, we have generated funds from the following sources: (i) cash collections from customers and (ii) cash received from sale of state NOL s.  
    
  In general, our primary uses of cash are providing for operating expenses, working capital purposes and servicing debt. As of 
  September 30, 2016  , we have not borrowed on our line of credit, which allowed for borrowings of up to $4.0 million. On January 28, 2016, the Line of Credit was amended with SVB, and we are no longer able to draw on the Line of Credit until we raise approximately $2.5 million of additional equity. As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the Company raised $5.0 million in May of 2016 and $5.5 million in September of 2016. Our largest source of operating cash flow is cash collections from our customers.           
  2  016 Offerings 
    
  May Offering 
    
  On May 25, 2016, we sold 2,467,820 shares of common stock in a public offering and warrants to purchase 1,233,910 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement. These offerings resulted in gross proceeds of   $5 million  . We sold   2,150,000   shares of common stock and warrants to purchase   1,075,000   shares of common stock to certain institutional investors at a combined offering price of   $2.00   per common share, and our Chairman of the Board, John Pappajohn, purchased   317,820   shares of common stock and warrants to purchase   158,910   shares of common stock at a combined offering price of   $2.2025   per common share. In addition, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of   123,391   shares of common stock to the placement agent. Subject to certain ownership limitations, the warrants will be initially exercisable commencing   six months   from the issuance date at an exercise price equal to   $2.25   per share of common stock. The warrants are exercisable for   five years   from the initial exercise date.  
    
  September Offering 
    
  On September 14, 2016, we sold 2,750,000 shares of common stock in a public offering and warrants to purchase 1,375,000 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement at a combined price of $2.00 per common share. These offerings resulted in gross proceeds of $5.5 million. In addition, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 137,500 shares of common stock to the placement agent. Subject to certain ownership restrictions, the warrants will be initially exercisable six months from the issuance date at an exercise price of $2.25 per share of common stock. The warrants are exercisable for five years from the initial exercise date.  
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Our net cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods below were as follows: 
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

We had cash and cash equivalents of   $10.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $19.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The   $8.7 million   decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , principally resulted from   $17.3 million   of net cash used in operations, fixed asset additions of $0.3 million, patent costs of $0.1 million, capital lease payments of $0.1 million and principal payments on the bank term note of $0.8 million, offset by $10.0 million of net proceeds from the 2016 Offerings. 
    
  The   $5.6 million   decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , principally resulted from $10.0 million of net cash used in operations and a $0.9 million deposit paid to acquire Response Genetics offset by a $6.0 million decrease in restricted cash related to our debt financing facility with Silicon Valley Bank that does not require us to maintain restricted cash accounts. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had total indebtedness of $5.3 million, excluding capital lease obligations. 
    
  Cash Used in Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash used in operating activities was   $17.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . We used $10.5 million in net cash to fund our core operations, which included $0.3 million in cash paid for interest. We incurred additional uses of cash when adjusting for working capital items as follows: a net increase in accounts receivable of $7.1 million and an increase in other current assets of $0.1 million, offset by a net increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue of $0.4 million.  
    
  We have a number of initiatives underway to bring use of cash from accounts receivable growth down to lower levels.  We have made significant progress in this area and all of the claims that were delayed due to system and integration issues from CGI West have been input and billed.  These efforts are improving our cash collections and we expect this trend to continue in the future.  
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we used   $10.0 million   in operating activities. We used $10.4 million in net cash to fund our core operations, which included $0.2 million in cash paid for interest. We incurred additional uses of cash when adjusting for working capital items as follows: a net increase in accounts receivable of $0.3 million; an increase in other current assets of $0.4 million, which includes prepayments for our insurance policies; an increase in other non-current assets of $0.1 million; and a net decrease in deferred rent and other of $0.1 million, offset by a net increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue of $1.3 million. 
    
  Cash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $0.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and resulted from the purchase of fixed assets of $0.3 million and patent costs of $0.1 million. 
    
  Net cash provided by investing activities was   $4.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and principally resulted from a $6 million decrease in restricted cash related to our new debt financing facility with Silicon Valley Bank that does not require us to maintain restricted cash accounts, partially offset by a $0.9 million deposit paid to acquire Response Genetics.  
    
  Cash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities 

22 

     Table of Contents  

Net cash provided by financing activities was   $9.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and principally resulted from proceeds received in the 2016 Offerings of $10.0 million, offset by principal payments made on the bank term note of $0.8 million and capital lease payments of $0.1 million. 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $0.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and principally resulted from payments for deferred equity offering costs of $0.2 million. 
    
  Capital Resources and Expenditure Requirements 
    
  We expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future. It may take several years, if ever, to achieve positive operational cash flow. We need to raise additional capital to fund our current operations, to repay certain outstanding indebtedness and to fund expansion of our business to meet our long-term business objectives through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic partnerships coupled with an investment in our company or a combination thereof. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, or other debt securities, these securities could be secured and could have rights senior to those of our common stock. In addition, any new debt incurred by the Company could impose covenants that restrict our operations and increase our interest expense. The issuance of any new equity securities will also dilute the interest of our current stockholders. Given the risks associated with our business, including our unprofitable operating history and our ability to develop additional proprietary tests, additional capital may not be available when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we will need to curb our expansion plans or limit our research and development activities, which would have a material adverse impact on our business prospects and results of operations. 
    
  We believe that our current cash will support operations for at least the next 6 to 9 months. We are exploring opportunities for additional equity or debt financing, and we are taking steps to improve our operating cash flow. We can provide no assurances that our current actions will be successful or that any additional sources of financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all, when needed. Our forecast of the period of time through which our current financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and the costs to support our general and administrative, sales and marketing and research and development activities are forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties. 
    
  The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary debt and/or equity financing to continue operations. These interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
    
  We expect our operating expenses to increase as we continue investing in sales and marketing, research and development and other general and administrative expenses. 
    
  Our forecast of the period of time through which our current financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and our expected operating expenses are forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors, including: 

our ability to achieve revenue growth and profitability; 
                
    the costs for funding the operations we recently acquired and our ability to successfully integrate those operations with and into our own; 
                
    our ability to improve efficiency of billing and collection processes; 
                
    our ability to obtain approvals for our new diagnostic tests; 
                
    our ability to execute on our marketing and sales strategy for our genomic tests and gain acceptance of our tests in the market; 
                
    our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payors for our tests and services; 
                
    the costs, scope, progress, results, timing and outcomes of the clinical trials of our diagnostic tests; 
                
    the costs of operating and enhancing our laboratory facilities; 
                
    our ability to succeed with our cost control initiative; 
                
    the timing of and the costs involved in regulatory compliance, particularly if the regulations change; 
                
    the costs of maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including potential litigation costs and liabilities; 
                
    our ability to manage the costs of manufacturing our tests; 
                
    our rate of progress in, and cost of research and development activities associated with, tests in research and early development; 
     
   23 

     Table of Contents  

the effect of competing technological and market developments; 
                
    costs related to expansion;  
                
    our ability to secure financing and the amount thereof; and 
                
    other risks and uncertainties discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and other reports, as applicable, we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
       
  We expect that our operating expenses and capital expenditures will increase in the future as we expand our business and integrate our recent acquisitions. We plan to increase our sales and marketing headcount to promote our new clinical tests and services and to expand into new geographies and to increase our research and development expenditures associated with performing work with research collaborators, to expand our pipeline and to perform work associated with our research collaborations. For example, in 2011 we entered into an affiliation agreement to form a joint venture with the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research pursuant to which we made an initial $1.0 million capital contribution in October 2013 and $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2014. We currently anticipate that we may make capital contributions up to $1.0 million in 2017 and may make additional capital contributions of up to $3.0 million, subject to the joint venture entity s achievement of certain operational milestones. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenues to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. 
    
  Subject to the availability of financing, we may use significant cash to fund acquisitions. On October 9, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Response Genetics for aggregate consideration of approximately $12.9 million consisting of $7.5 million in cash and our common stock valued at approximately $5.4 million. 
    
  In May 2015, we entered into a line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank. Pursuant to the amendment dated January 28, 2016, the Company agreed not to draw on the line of credit until $2.5 million of additional equity is raised. As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the Company raised $5.0 million in May of 2016 and $5.5 million in September of 2016. See Note 5 of Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Over the past several years, we have generated operating losses in all jurisdictions in which we may be subject to income taxes. As a result, we have accumulated significant net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. Because of our history of losses and the uncertainty as to the realization of those deferred tax assets, a full valuation allowance has been recognized. We do not expect to report a benefit related to the deferred tax assets until we have a history of earnings, if ever, that would support the realization of our deferred tax assets. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  Since inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet activities as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgment and Estimates 
    
  Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and make various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
    
  Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an  emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an  emerging growth company  can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to  opt out  of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 
    
  This report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 under Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as  may,   will,   should,   could,   would,   expects,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   projects,   predicts,   potential,  or the negative of those terms, and similar expressions and comparable terminology intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events. There are a number of important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by us. These factors include, but are not limited to: 

our ability to achieve profitability by increasing sales of our laboratory tests and services and to continually develop and commercialize novel and innovative diagnostic tests and services for cancer patients; 
                
    ability to raise additional capital to meet our liquidity needs; 
                
    our ability to improve efficiency of billing and collection processes; 
                
    our ability clinically validate our pipeline of genomic microarray tests currently in development; 
                
    our ability to execute on our marketing and sales strategy for our genomic tests and gain acceptance of our tests in the market; 
                
    our ability to keep pace with rapidly advancing market and scientific developments; 
                
    our ability to satisfy U.S. (including FDA) and international regulatory requirements with respect to our tests and services, many of which are new and still evolving;

Item 4.        Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  We evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), as amended, as of   September 30, 2016  , the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (principal accounting and financial officer) have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. Controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the above objectives have been met. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
