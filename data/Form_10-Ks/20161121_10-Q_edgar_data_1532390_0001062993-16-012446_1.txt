  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS   (unaudited)   
  NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
   Basis of presentation   
 The consolidated financial statements included herein have been
prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted. However,
in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal
recurring adjustments, unless otherwise indicated) necessary to present fairly
the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have
been made. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
trends or of results to be expected for the full year. These financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the
Company for the year ended March 31, 2016 (including the notes thereto) set
forth on Form 10-K. The Company uses as guidance the Accounting Standard
Codification (ASC) as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB).  
   Principles of consolidation   
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (a Nevada Corporation), Alkaline Water Corp. (an
Arizona Corporation) and Alkaline 88, LLC (an Arizona Limited Liability
Company).  
 All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated. The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (a Nevada Corporation),
Alkaline Water Corp. (an Arizona Corporation) and Alkaline 88, LLC (an Arizona
Limited Liability Company) will be collectively referred herein to as the
 Company . Any reference herein to  The Alkaline Water Company Inc. , the
 Company ,  we ,  our  or  us  is intended to mean The Alkaline Water Company
Inc., including the subsidiaries indicated above, unless otherwise
indicated. 
   Reverse split   
 Effective December 30, 2015, the Company effected a fifty for
one reverse stock split of its authorized and issued and outstanding shares of
common stock. As a result, the authorized common stock has decreased from
1,125,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share, to
22,500,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share. All
shares and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect such
split. 
 On January 21, 2016, stockholders of our company approved, by
written consents, an amendment to the articles of incorporation of our company
to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 22,500,000
to 200,000,000. 
 The Company received written consents representing 20,776,000
votes from the holders of shares of its common stock and our Series A Preferred
Stock voting as a single class, representing approximately 61% of the voting
power of its outstanding common stock and its outstanding Series A Preferred
Stock voting as a single class as of the record date (January 12, 2016). On
January 21, 2016, there were no written consents received by the Company
representing a vote against, abstention or broker non-vote with respect to the
proposal. 
 6  

Our authorized preferred stock was not affected by the reverse
stock split and continues to be 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with a
par value of $0.001 per share. In addition, the number of issued and outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock continues to be 20,000,000. However, holders
of Series A Preferred Stock had 0.2 vote per share of Series A Preferred Stock,
instead of 10 votes per share of Series A Preferred Stock, as a result of the
reverse stock split. 
 On January 22, 2016, the Company amended the certificate of
designation for our Series A Preferred Stock by filing an amendment to
certificate of designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada.
The Company amended the certificate of designation for our Series A Preferred
Stock by deleting Section 2.2 of the certificate of designation, which
proportionately increases or decreases the number of votes per share of Series A
Preferred Stock in the event of any dividend or other distribution on our common
stock payable in its common stock or a subdivision or consolidation of the
outstanding shares of its common stock. Accordingly, holders of Series A
Preferred Stock will have 10 votes per share of Series A Preferred Stock,
instead of 0.2 votes per share of Series A Preferred Stock. 
   Use of estimates    
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
significantly from those estimates. 
   Cash and cash equivalents   
 The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be considered cash equivalents. The
carrying value of these investments approximates fair value. The Company had
$189,712 and $1,192,119 in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 and
March 31, 2016, respectively. 
   Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful
accounts    
 The Company generally does not require collateral, and the
majority of its trade receivables are unsecured. The carrying amount for
accounts receivable approximates fair value. 
 Accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for
collectability based on past credit history with clients. Provisions for losses
on accounts receivable are determined on the basis of loss experience, known and
inherent risk in the account balance and current economic conditions. 
   Inventory    
 Inventory represents raw and blended chemicals and other items
valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the weight
average method which approximates first-in first-out method, and with market
defined as the lower of replacement cost or realizable value.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and March, 31 2016, inventory
consisted of the following: 

7  

Property and equipment    
 The Company records all property and equipment at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Improvements are capitalized while repairs and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets or the lease
term, whichever is shorter. Depreciation periods are as follows for the relevant
fixed assets: 

Equipment  
     5 years   
   
     Equipment under capital lease  
     3 years or term of the lease

Stock-based Compensation    
 The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees
in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 718. Stock-based
compensation to employees is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value
of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service
period. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to other than
employees in accordance with ASC 505-50. Equity instruments issued to other than
employees are valued at the earlier of a commitment date or upon completion of
the services, based on the fair value of the equity instruments and is
recognized as expense over the service period. The Company estimates the fair
value of stock-based payments using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for
common stock options and warrants and the closing price of the Company s common
stock for common share issuances. 
  Revenue recognition   
 The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;
(2) the product or service has been provided to the customer; (3) the amount to
be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of such
amount is probable. 
 The Company records revenue when it is realizable and earned
upon shipment of the finished products. The Company does not accept returns due
to the nature of the product. However, the Company will provide credit to our
customers for damaged goods. 
   Fair value measurements    
 The valuation of our embedded derivatives and warrant
derivatives are determined primarily by the multinomial distribution (Lattice)
model. An embedded derivative is a derivative instrument that is embedded within
another contract, which under the convertible note (the host contract) includes
the right to convert the note by the holder, certain default redemption right
premiums and a change of control premium (payable in cash if a fundamental
change occurs). In accordance with ASC 815   Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities  , as amended, these embedded derivatives
are marked-to-market each reporting period, with a corresponding non-cash gain
or loss charged to the current period. A warrant derivative liability is also
determined in accordance with ASC 815. Based on ASC 815, warrants which are
determined to be classified as derivative liabilities are marked-to-market each
reporting period, with a corresponding non-cash gain or loss charged to the
current period. The practical effect of this has been that when our stock price
increases so does our derivative liability resulting in a non-cash loss charge
that reduces our earnings and earnings per share. When our stock price declines,
the Company records a non-cash gain, increasing our earnings and earnings per
share. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be
determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, there exists a
three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring
fair value as follows: 

Level 1   
     
       unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
      assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the
      measurement date.     

Level 2  
     
       inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
      that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly
      observable through corroboration with observable market data.    

Level 3  
     
       unobservable inputs for the asset or liability only used
      when there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability
      at the measurement date.     
 8  

This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market
data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
determining fair value. 
 To determine the fair value of our embedded derivatives,
management evaluates assumptions regarding the probability of certain future
events. Other factors used to determine fair value include our period end stock
price, historical stock volatility, risk free interest rate and derivative term.
The fair value recorded for the derivative liability varies from period to
period. This variability may result in the actual derivative liability for a
period either above or below the estimates recorded on our consolidated
financial statements, resulting in significant fluctuations in other income
(expense) because of the corresponding non-cash gain or loss recorded. 
   Income taxes    
 In accordance with ASC 740   Accounting for Income
Taxes  , the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured
using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is
provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available
evidence, are not expected to be realized. 
   Basic and diluted loss per share    
 Basic and diluted earnings or loss per share ( EPS ) amounts in
the consolidated financial statements are computed in accordance ASC 260   10
  Earnings per Share  , which establishes the requirements for presenting
EPS. Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding and dilutive common stock equivalents. Basic EPS is computed
by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders (numerator) by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during
the period. Potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation
of diluted loss per share, because their effect would be anti-dilutive. 
   Reclassification    
 Certain accounts in the prior period were reclassified to
conform to the current period financial statements presentation.  
   Newly issued accounting pronouncements    
 During the period ended September 30, 2016, there were several
new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board. Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted
by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these
accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the
Company s consolidated financial statements  
  NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the recoverability and/or acquisition and sale of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. Since its inception, the Company
has been engaged substantially in financing activities, developing its business
plan and building its initial customer and distribution base for its products.
As a result, the Company incurred accumulated net losses from
Inception (June 19, 2012) through the period ended September 30, 2016 of
($22,223,241). In addition, the Company s development activities since inception
have been financially sustained through debt and equity financing.  
 9  

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital from the sale of common
stock and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating revenues. These
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and
classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.  
  NOTE 3   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   
 Fixed assets consisted of the following at:  

Depreciation expense for the years ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30 2015 was $180,397 and $142,129, respectively. 
  NOTE 4   EQUIPMENT DEPOSITS   RELATED PARTY   
 During the six month period ending September 30, 2016 the
company made a net deposit on equipment of $104,619 to Water Engineering
Solutions. During the six month period ending September 30, 2015 the company
made a net deposit on equipment of $139,997 to Water Engineering Solutions.
Water Engineering Solutions LLC is an entity that is controlled and majority
owned by Steven P. Nickolas and Richard A. Wright for the production of our
alkaline water.  
  NOTE 5   REVOLVING FINANCING  
 On February 20, 2014, The Alkaline Water Company Inc., and
subsidiaries, Alkaline 88, LLC and Alkaline Water Corp., entered into a
revolving accounts receivable funding agreement with Gibraltar Business Capital,
LLC ( Gibraltar ). Under the agreement, from time to time, the Company agreed to
tender to Gibraltar all of our accounts (which is defined as our rights to
payment whether or not earned by performance, (i) for property that has been or
is to be sold, leased, licensed, assigned or otherwise disposed of, or (ii) for
services rendered or to be rendered, or (iii) as otherwise defined in the
Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Illinois). Gibraltar will have the
right, but will not be obligated, to purchase such accounts tendered in its sole
discretion. If Gibraltar purchases such accounts, Gibraltar will make cash
advances to us as the purchase price for the purchased accounts.  
 The Company assumed full risk of non-payment and
unconditionally guaranteed the full and prompt payment of the full face amount
of all purchased accounts. The Company also agreed to direct all parties
obligated to pay the accounts to send all payments for all accounts directly to
Gibraltar. All collections from accounts will be applied to our indebtedness,
which is defined as the amount owed by us to Gibraltar from time to time, i.e.,
all cash advances, plus all charges, plus all other amounts owning from us to
Gibraltar pursuant to the agreement, less all collections retained by Gibraltar
from either purchased accounts or from us which are applied to indebtedness,
unless Gibraltar elects to hold any such collections to establish reserves to
secure payment of any purchased accounts.  
 10  

In consideration of Gibraltar s purchase of the accounts, the
Company agreed to pay Gibraltar interest on the indebtedness outstanding at the
rate of 8% per annum plus the prime rate in effect at the end of each month with
the prime rate for these purposes never being less than 3.25% per annum,
calculated on a 360-day year and payable monthly. In addition, the Company
agreed to pay to Gibraltar a monthly collateral/management fee in the amount of
0.5% calculated on the average daily borrowing amount for the given month and an
unused line fee of 0.25% monthly based on the difference between the actual line
of credit and the average daily borrowing amount for the given month. The
Company also agreed to pay to Gibraltar upon execution of the agreement and as
of the commencement of each renewal term, a closing cost of 1% of the initial
indebtedness in addition to the amount of any other credit accommodations
granted from Gibraltar, which amount will be deducted from the first cash
advances.  
 The initial indebtedness is $500,000 and the Company increased
the amount available under the revolving accounts receivable funding agreement
to $900,000 on May 12, 2016. The Company may request further increase(s) to the
in $100,000 increments up to $5,000,000, subject the Company s financial
performance and/or projections are satisfactory to Gibraltar, and absent an
event of default. The Company also granted to Gibraltar a security interest in
all of our presently-owned and hereafter-acquired personal and fixture property,
wherever located. The agreement will continue until the first to occur of (i)
demand by Gibraltar; or (ii) 24 months from the first day of the month following
the date that the first purchased account is purchased and will be automatically
renewed for successive periods of 12 months thereafter unless, at least 30 days
prior to the end of the term, the Company gives Gibraltar notice of our
intention to terminate the agreement. In addition, the Company will be able to
exit the agreement at any time for a fee of 2% of the line of credit in place at
the time of prepayment. On September 30, 2016 the amount borrowed on this
facility was $563,191. 
  NOTE 6   DERIVATIVE LIABILITY  
 On May 1, 2014, the Company sold 346,667 shares of our common
stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 173,333 shares of our common
stock, for aggregate gross proceeds of $2,599,999. Each share of common stock
sold in the offering was accompanied by a warrant to purchase one-half of a
share of common stock at an exercise price of $7.50 per share for a period of
five years from the date of issuance. Each share of common stock, together with
each warrant was sold at a price of $7.50. The warrants include down-round
provisions that reduce the exercise price of a warrant and convertible
instrument  
 On August 20, 2014, the Company entered into a warrant
amendment agreement with certain holders of the Company s outstanding common
stock purchase warrants whereby the Company agreed to reduce the exercise price
of the Existing Warrants to $5.00 per share. in consideration for the immediate
exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Holders and the Holders are to be
issued new common stock purchase warrants of the Company in the form of the
Existing Warrants to purchase up to a number of shares of our common stock equal
to the number of Existing Warrants exercised by the Holders, provided that the
exercise price of the New Warrants will be $6. 25 per share, subject to
adjustment in the New Warrants. Each New Warrant has a term of five years from
the date of issuance. Each share of common stock, together with each warrant was
sold at a price of $6.25. The warrants include down-round provisions that reduce
the exercise price of a warrant and convertible instrument. . As required by ASC
815  Derivatives and Hedging  , if the Company either issues equity shares for a
price that is lower than the exercise price of those instruments or issues new
warrants or convertible instruments that have a lower exercise price, the
investors will be entitled to down-round protection. Tthe Company evaluated
whether its warrants and convertible debt instruments contain provisions that
protect holders from declines in its stock price or otherwise could result in
modification of either the exercise price or the shares to be issued under the
respective warrant agreements. The Company determined that a portion of its
outstanding warrants and conversion instruments contained such provisions
thereby concluding they were not indexed to the Company s own stock and
therefore a derivative instrument. As of September 30, 2016, one holders has
6,667 warrants and the derivative liability associated with these warrants is
$1,656.  
 Pursuant to the engagement agreement dated March 12, 2014 with
H.C. Wainwright   Co., LLC ( Wainwright ), Wainwright agreed to act as our
exclusive placement agent in connection with the offering. Pursuant to the

aggregate of 5.5% of the aggregate number of shares of our common stock sold in
the offering, or 19,067 to Wainwright and its designees.

These warrants have an exercise price of $9.38 per share and
expire on April 16, 2019. The warrants include down-round provisions that reduce
the exercise price of a warrant and convertible instrument. . As required by ASC
815  Derivatives and Hedging  the Company evaluated whether its warrants and
convertible debt instruments contain provisions that protect holders from
declines in its stock price or otherwise could result in modification of either
the exercise price or the shares to be issued under the respective warrant
agreements. The Company determined that a portion of its outstanding warrants
and conversion instruments contained such provisions thereby concluding they
were not indexed to the Company s own stock and therefore a derivative
instrument. As of September 30, 2016, six holders have 21,392 warrants and the
derivative liability associated with these warrants is $3,130.  
 The Company analyzed the warrants and conversion feature under
ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging  to determine the derivative liability. The
Company estimated the fair value of these derivatives using a multinomial
distribution (Lattice) valuation model. The fair value of these warrant
liabilities at March 31, 2016 was $11,143 at September 30, 2016 was $6,357.
Changes in the derivative liability for the period ended September 30, 2016

products to additional retailers throughout the country. As of September 30,
2016, the product is now available in all 50 states at an estimated 25,000
retail locations. As of September 30, 2015, the product was available in all 50

alkaline water. The increase in sales is due to the expanded distribution of our
products to additional retailers throughout the country. As of September 30,
2016, the product is now available in all 50 states at an estimated 25,000
retail locations. As of September 30, 2015, the product was available in all 50
states at an estimated 20,000 retail locations. This increase has occurred
primarily through the addition of 36 of the top national grocery retailers as
customer during the year ended March 31, 2016. We distribute our product through
several channels. We sell through large national distributors (UNFI, KeHe, Tree
of Life, C S, Core-Mark and Nature s Best), which together represent over
150,000 retail outlets. We also sell our product directly to retail clients,
including convenience stores, natural food products stores, large ethnic markets
and national retailers. Some examples of retail clients are, Albertson s,
Safeway, Kroger, Schnucks, Smart   Final, Jewel-Osco, Sprouts, Bashas ,
Stater Bros. Markets, Unified Grocers, Bristol Farms, Vallarta, Superior Foods,
Ingles, HEB and Brookshire s.  
 Cost of goods sold is comprised of production costs, shipping
and handling costs. For the six months ended September 30, 2016, we had cost of
goods sold of $3,686,825, or 62%% of revenue, as compared to cost of goods sold
of $2,082,326 or 64% of revenue, for the six months ended September 30, 2015.
The increase in gross profit rate is a result of reduced raw material cost
through greater volume purchases from our suppliers.  
  Expenses   
 Our operating expenses for the six months ended September 30,
2016 and September 30, 2015 are as follows:  

For the six months ended September 30, 2016, our total
operating expenses were $4,224,301, as compared to $3,425,357 for the six months
ended September 30, 2015. 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2016, the total included
$2,146,389 of sales and marketing expenses and $1,897,515 of general and
administrative expenses, consisting primarily of approximately $319,125 of
shares stock option compensation expense, and $649,881 of professional fees. 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2015 the total included
$1,394,736 of sales and marketing expenses and $1,888,1462 of general and
administrative expenses, consisting primarily of approximately $892,760 of
shares stock option compensation expense, and $203,540 of professional fees. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources   
  Working Capital   

Current Assets

Current assets as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016
primarily relate to $189,711 and $1,192,119 in cash, $1,079,838 and $911,390 in
accounts receivable and $547,609 and $434,708 in inventory, respectively.

  Cash Flow   
 Our cash flows for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015 are as follows:  
 
  Operating Activities  
 Net cash used in operating activities was $1,650,263 for the
six months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1,274,562 used in operating
activities for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net cash
used in operating activities was primarily due to reduction of accounts payable
in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to an increase of accounts
payable in the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 
  Investing Activities   
 Net cash used in investing activities was $184,315 for the six
months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $142,847 used in investing
activities for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net cash
used by investing activities was the result of an increase of purchase of fixed
assets and equipment deposits. 
  Financing Activities  
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months
ended September 30, 2016 was $832,170, as compared to $1,365,991 for the six
months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of net cash provided by financing
activities was mainly attributable to repayment of notes payable.  
  Loan Facility Agreement with Turnstone Capital Inc.   
 On September 20, 2016, we entered into a loan facility
agreement (the   Loan Agreement  ) with Turnstone Capital Inc. (the
  Lender  ), whereby the Lender agreed to make available to our company a
loan in the aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 (the   Loan Amount  ).
Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Lender agreed to make one or more advances
of the Loan Amount to our company as requested from time to time by our company
in an amount to be agreed upon by our company and the Lender (each, an
  Advance  ), provided that the Lender has the option to provide an
additional Advances of up to $500,000 for the purchase of equipment by our
company.  
 On September 20, 2016, the Lender made the first Advance in the
amount of $250,000 to our company.  
 The Loan Amount will mature on the date which is two years
after the date of the first Advance or such earlier date as the principal amount
of all Advances owing from time to time and all other amounts payable under the
Loan Agreement, and at any time outstanding, (the   Principal
Amount  ) may become due and payable in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Loan Agreement.  
 22  

We agreed to commence repayment of the Principal Amount, on a
monthly basis, beginning on the date that is 12 months after the date of the
first Advance with the amount to be repaid each month being equal to the
Principal Amount outstanding on the date of such monthly payment divided by the
number of months remaining before the Maturity Date.  
 The Principal Amount will bear simple interest at a rate of
10.0% per annum. Interest will be calculated daily and paid monthly for the
previous 30 days commencing on the date which is 35 days after the first
Advance. We may prepare all or any portion of the Principal Amount and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon not less than ten days  prior written
notice.  
 So long as any Principal Amount remains outstanding, if we
complete any debt or equity financing of more than $250,000 (other than in
connection with certain exempt issuances), then we agreed to use the proceeds of
such financing to repay any Principal Amount remaining outstanding at the time
of the completion of such financing.  
 Any Principal Amount, and any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon, will be convertible into shares of our common stock by the Lender, at
its option, at any time. The conversion is to occur at a conversion price of
$1.00.  
  Cash Requirements  
 We believe that cash flow from operations will not meet our
present and near-term cash needs and thus we will require additional cash
resources, including the sale of equity or debt securities, to meet our planned
capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next 12 months. We
estimate that our capital needs over the next 12 months will be up to
$3,000,000. We will require additional cash resources to, among other things,
expand broker network, increase manufacturing capacity, expand retail
distribution and add support staff. If our own financial resources and future
cash-flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements,
we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional
credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities will result in
dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in
increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating
and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans
to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms
acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on
terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business
operations and could harm our overall business prospects.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our
stockholders.  
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk.   
 Not applicable.  
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures", as that term

Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Disclosure controls
and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our company's reports filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's
rules and forms, and that such  
 23  

information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
 As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our management, with the participation of our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated our
company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered

concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on
Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

to a consultant as partial consideration for settling any outstanding claims

relied on an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act

      is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal
      control over financial reporting; and     

5.  
     
       I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of
      internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors
      and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons
      performing the equivalent functions):

      are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to
      record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
