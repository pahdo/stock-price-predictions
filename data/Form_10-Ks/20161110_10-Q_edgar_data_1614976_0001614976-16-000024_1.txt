  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS 
  Cole Office   Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc. (the  Company ) is a Maryland corporation that was incorporated on May 22, 2014, and which intends to qualify and elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning in its taxable year ending December 31, 2016, as it did not commence principal operations until September 22, 2016. The Company is the sole general partner of, and owns, directly or indirectly,   100%   of the partnership interests in Cole Corporate Income Operating Partnership III, LP, a Delaware limited partnership. The Company is externally managed by Cole Corporate Income Advisors III, LLC ( CCI III Advisors ), a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of the Company s sponsor, Cole Capital       , which is a trade name used to refer to a group of affiliated entities directly or indirectly controlled by VEREIT, Inc. ( VEREIT ), a widely-held public company whose shares of common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: VER). VEREIT indirectly owns and/or controls the Company s external advisor, CCI III Advisors, the Company s dealer manager, Cole Capital Corporation ( CCC ), the Company s property manager, CREI Advisors, LLC ( CREI Advisors ), and the Company s sponsor, Cole Capital.  
  Pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-11 (Registration No. 333-209128) (the  Registration Statement ) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on September 22, 2016, the Company commenced its initial public offering on a  best efforts  basis, offering up to a maximum of   $3.5 billion   in shares of common stock (the  Offering ). Pursuant to the Offering, the Company is offering up to   $2.5 billion   in shares of its common stock pursuant to the primary offering, consisting of   two   classes of shares: Class A common stock ( Class A Shares ) at a price of   $10.00   per share (up to   $1.25 billion   in shares) and Class T common stock ( Class T Shares ) at a price of   $9.57   per share (up to   $1.25 billion   in shares). Pursuant to the Offering, the Company is also offering up to   $1.0 billion   in shares of its common stock pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan (the  DRIP ) at a purchase price during the Offering equal to the per share primary offering price net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, or   $9.10   per share for both Class A Shares and Class T Shares, assuming a   $10.00   per Class A Share primary offering price and a   $9.57   per Class T Share primary offering price. 
  On September 22, 2016, the Company satisfied the conditions of the escrow agreement regarding the minimum offering amount under the Offering and issued   274,725   Class A Shares to VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P. ( VEREIT OP ), an affiliate of Cole Capital and the operating partnership of VEREIT, resulting in gross proceeds of   $2.5 million  , and commenced principal operations.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had issued   274,725     Class A Shares in the Offering for gross proceeds of     $2.5 million  . The Company intends to use substantially all of the net proceeds from the Offering to acquire and operate a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate investments primarily consisting of single-tenant, income-producing necessity office and industrial properties, which are leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term leases, including distribution facilities, warehouses, manufacturing plants and corporate or regional headquarters in strategic locations. The Company expects that most of its properties will be subject to  net  leases, whereby the tenant will be primarily responsible for the property s cost of repairs, maintenance, property taxes, utilities, insurance and other operating costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   one   office property, located in Ohio and leased to Siemens Corporation, comprising approximately   221,000   rentable square feet of income-producing necessity corporate office property, which was   100%   leased. 
   
  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company s condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements. 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding interim financial reporting, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the statements for the interim periods presented include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods. Results for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of full year results. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated balance sheet and related notes thereto included in the Registration Statement as declared effective by the SEC on September 22, 2016. Consolidated results of operations for the periods ended

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
  September 30, 2016 

September 30, 2015 have not been presented because the Company had not commenced its principal operations during such periods. The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements should also be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
  The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Use of Estimates  
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Real Estate Investments 
  Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Amounts capitalized to real estate assets consist of the cost of acquisition, construction and any tenant improvements, major improvements and betterments that extend the useful life of the real estate assets and leasing costs. All acquisition-related expenses, repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 
  The Company considers the period of future benefit of each respective asset to determine the appropriate useful life. The estimated useful lives of the Company s real estate assets by class are generally as follows: 
                    Buildings 
    40 years 
      Tenant improvements 
    Lesser of useful life or lease term 
      Intangible lease assets 
    Lease term 

Recoverability of Real Estate Assets 
  The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate assets may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators that the Company considers include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy or other credit concerns of a property s major tenant, such as a history of late payments, rental concessions and other factors, a significant decrease in a property s revenues due to lease terminations, vacancies, co-tenancy clauses, reduced lease rates, or other circumstances. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of the assets by determining whether the carrying amount of the assets will be recovered through the undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. In the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, the Company will adjust the real estate assets to their respective fair values and recognize an impairment loss. Generally, fair value will be determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and recent comparable sales transactions. No impairment indicators were identified and   no   impairment losses were recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Allocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate Assets 
  Upon the acquisition of real properties, the Company allocates the purchase price to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, and to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above- and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, based in each case on their respective fair values. Acquisition-related expenses are expensed as incurred. The Company utilizes independent appraisals to assist in the determination of the fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land and buildings). The information in the appraisal, along with any additional information available to the Company s management, is used in estimating the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to land. Other information in the appraisal, such as building value and market rents, may be used by the Company s management in estimating the allocation of purchase price to the building and to intangible lease assets and liabilities. The appraisal firm has no involvement in management s allocation decisions other than providing this market information.  
  The determination of the fair values of the real estate assets and liabilities acquired requires the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates, rental growth rates, capitalization and discount rates, interest rates and other variables. The use of alternative estimates may result in a different allocation of the Company s purchase price, which could materially impact the Company s results of operations.

Deferred Financing Costs 
  Debt issuance costs related to securing the Company s revolving line of credit are presented as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement. The Company s total deferred financing costs, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets relate only to the revolving loan portion of the Credit Facility (as defined in Note 5       Credit Facility and Subordinate Promissory Note). As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $1.5 million   of deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, related to the revolving loan portion of the Credit Facility. 
  Due to Affiliates 
  Certain affiliates of CCI III Advisors received fees, reimbursements, and compensation in connection with services provided relating to the Offering and the acquisition, management, financing, and leasing of the Company s property. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $17,000   was due to CCI III Advisors and its affiliates for such services, as discussed in Note 7   Related-Party Transactions and Arrangements. 
  Distribution and Stockholder Servicing Fees  
  The Company will pay CCC a distribution and stockholder servicing fee for Class T Shares which are calculated on a daily basis in the amount of 1/365th of 1.0% of the purchase price per share (or, once reported, the amount of the Company s estimated per share net asset value) of Class T Shares sold in the primary portion of the Offering. The distribution and stockholder servicing fee will be paid monthly in arrears. An estimated liability for future distribution and stockholder servicing fees payable to CCC will be recognized at the time each Class T Share is sold and included in due to affiliates in the condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets with a corresponding decrease to capital in excess of par value. 
    
  Redeemable Common Stock  
  Under the Company s share redemption program, the Company s ability to redeem shares of its outstanding common stock is limited, among other things, to the net proceeds received by the Company from the sale of shares under the DRIP, net of shares redeemed to date. The Company records amounts that are redeemable under the share redemption program as redeemable common stock outside of permanent equity in its condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets. Changes in the amount of redeemable common stock from period to period will be recorded as an adjustment to capital in excess of par value.  
  Revenue Recognition 
  The Company s property has a lease where minimum rental payments increase during the term of the lease. The Company records rental income for the full term of the lease on a straight-line basis when earned and collectability is reasonably assured. When the Company acquires a property, the terms of existing leases are considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purpose of this calculation. The Company defers the recognition of contingent rental income, such as percentage rents, until the specific target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved. Expected reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses are included in tenant reimbursement income in the period when such costs are incurred. 
  The Company continually reviews receivables related to rent, including any unbilled straight-line rent, and determines collectability by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, the Company will record an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not have an allowance for uncollectible accounts. 
  Income Taxes  
  The Company intends to qualify and elect to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), commencing with its taxable year ending   December 31, 2016  , as it did not commence principal operations until September 22, 2016. If the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company will generally not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent it distributes its taxable income to its stockholders, and so long as it, among other things, distributes at least 90% of its annual taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains). REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it or its subsidiaries may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.

Net Loss Per Common Share 
  We have   two   classes of common stock. Accordingly, we will utilize the two-class method to determine our earnings per share, which results in different earnings per share for each of the classes. Under the two-class method, earnings per class of common share are computed by dividing the sum of the distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares for each class of common stock for the respective period. The distributed earnings to Class T Share common stockholders will represent distributions declared less the distribution and stockholder servicing fees. Diluted income (loss) per share considers the effect of any potentially dilutive share equivalents, of which the Company had   none   for each of the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  Organization and Offering Expenses  
  CCI III Advisors funds all of the organization and offering costs on the Company s behalf (excluding selling commissions, the dealer manager fees and the distribution and stockholder servicing fees) and may be reimbursed up to   1.0%   of the gross proceeds from the Offering. As of   September 30, 2016  , CCI III Advisors had paid organization and offering costs in excess of   1.0%   of the gross proceeds from the Offering. These excess costs were not included in the financial statements of the Company because such costs are not a liability of the Company as they exceeded   1.0%   of the gross proceeds from the Offering. As the Company raises additional proceeds from the Offering, these excess costs may become payable. The Company expenses organization costs as incurred and records offering costs, which include items such as legal and accounting fees, marketing, personnel, promotional and printing costs, as a reduction of capital in excess of par value along with selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees in the period in which they become payable. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers     The requirements were amended to remove inconsistencies in revenue requirements and to provide a more complete framework for addressing revenue issues across a broad range of industries and transaction types. The revised standard s core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The revised standard also clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract to a customer. These provisions are effective January 1, 2018, and are to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. The Company has identified its revenue streams and is in the process of evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements and internal accounting processes; however, as the majority of the Company s revenue is derived from real estate lease contracts, as discussed in relation to ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ), the Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 or related amendments and modifications issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by various standard setting bodies that may have an impact on the Company s accounting and reporting. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that certain of these new accounting requirements may have on the Company s accounting and related reporting and disclosures in the Company s consolidated financial statements: 
  ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments (Subtopic 825-10)     The amendments in this update require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The amendments in this update also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income (loss), the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. In addition, the amendments in this update require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the consolidated balance sheets or the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which replaces the existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 840,   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as either finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use ( ROU ) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize a straight-line total

lease expense. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 and are required to be applied on a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. 
  ASU No. 2016-05,   Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships     The amendments in this update clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship, provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. These provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses   (Topic 326) ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 requires more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans held for investment, held-to-maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investment in leases and other such commitments. ASU 2016-13 requires that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require the Company to measure all expected credit losses based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets and eliminates the  incurred loss  methodology in current GAAP. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ), which is intended to address diversity in practice related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues as well as application of the predominance principle (dependence on predominant source or use of receipt or payment) and are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. 
   
  NOTE 3   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  GAAP defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. GAAP emphasizes that fair value is intended to be a market-based measurement, as opposed to a transaction-specific measurement. 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, various techniques and assumptions can be used to estimate the fair value. Assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy, as follows: 
  Level 1   Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
  Level 2   Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active (markets with few transactions), inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs). 
  Level 3   Unobservable inputs, which are only used to the extent that observable inputs are not available, reflect the Company s assumptions about the pricing of an asset or liability. 
  The following describes the methods the Company uses to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities:  
  Credit facility and subordinate promissory note     The fair value is estimated by discounting the expected cash flows based on estimated borrowing rates available to the Company as of the measurement date. These financial instruments are valued using Level 2 inputs. As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of the Company s debt was   $33.1 million  ,  which approximated the carrying value on that date. The carrying and fair values exclude net deferred financing costs. 
  Other financial instruments      The Company considers the carrying values of its cash and cash equivalents, tenant and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, other liabilities, and due to affiliates in order to approximate their

fair values because of the short period of time between their origination and their expected realization as well as their highly-liquid nature. Due to the short-term maturities of these instruments, Level 1 inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. 
  Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize, or be liable for, on disposition of the financial assets and liabilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between fair value hierarchy levels. 

NOTE 4   REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT 
  2016 Property Acquisition 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired   one   office property for a purchase price of   $32.8 million   (the    2016     Acquisition   ). The Company purchased the   2016   Acquisition with net proceeds from the Offering and available borrowings. The purchase price allocation for the   2016   Acquisition is preliminary and subject to change as the Company finalizes the allocation, which the Company expects will be prior to the end of the current fiscal year.  
    
  The Company preliminarily allocated the purchase price of the   2016   Acquisition to the fair value of the assets acquired, as summarized in the table below. 
   
 ______________________ 
           (1) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average amortization period for the acquired in-place lease is   9.6   years for the   one   acquisition completed during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
     As the 2016 Acquisition was acquired during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded revenue for both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   of   $60,000   and a net loss of   $755,000   related to the 2016 Acquisition. In addition, the Company recorded   $755,000   of acquisition-related expenses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, which is included in acquisition-related expenses on the condensed consolidated unaudited statements of operations. 
  The following table summarizes selected financial information of the Company as if the   2016     Acquisition   was completed on January 1, 2016 for each period presented below. The table below presents the Company s estimated revenue and net loss, on a pro forma basis, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

The pro forma information for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was adjusted to exclude   $755,000   of acquisition-related expenses recorded during such period related to the   2016     Acquisition  . No such adjustment was made for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and may not be indicative of what actual results of operations would have been had the transaction occurred at the beginning of the period, nor does it purport to represent the results of future operations. 
   
  NOTE 5   CREDIT FACILITY AND SUBORDINATE PROMISSORY NOTE 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $32.3 million   of debt outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of   3.9%   and weighted average years to maturity of   2.3   years. 
  On September 23, 2016, the Company entered into a secured credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) with JPMorgan Chase, Bank N.A. ( JPMorgan Chase ), as administrative agent and a lender, and KeyBank, National Association ( KeyBank ) as a

lender under the credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ), that provides for borrowings of up to   $100.0 million   in revolving loans (the  Revolving Loans ). The Revolving Loans mature on September 23, 2019; however, the Company may elect to extend the maturity dates of such loans to September 23, 2021, subject to satisfying certain conditions described in the Credit Agreement.  
  Depending upon the type of loan specified and overall leverage ratio, the Credit Facility bears interest at (i) the one-month, two-month, three-month or six-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), as elected by the Company, multiplied by the statutory reserve rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus the applicable rate (the  Eurodollar Applicable Rate ), ranging from   2.20%   to   2.75%  , and the Company s leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). For base rate committed loans, the interest rate will be equal to a rate ranging from   1.20%   to   1.75%  , depending on the Company s leverage ratio, plus a per annum amount equal to the greater of: (i) JPMorgan Chase s Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement); (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus   0.50%  ; and (iii) one-month LIBOR multiplied by the statutory reserve rate plus   1.0%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount outstanding under the Revolving Loans totaled   $22.0 million   at an interest rate of   3.31%  . The Company had   $78.0 million   in unused capacity, subject to borrowing availability, as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, borrowing conditions and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including minimum net worth, debt service coverage and leverage ratio requirements and dividend payout and REIT status requirements. In particular, the Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth greater than or equal to   75%   of the issuance of equity from the date of the Credit Agreement, a leverage ratio no greater than   70%   and a fixed charge coverage ratio greater than   1.50  . The Company believes it was in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  In addition, during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company entered into a   $30.0 million   subordinate loan with an affiliate of the Company s advisor (the  Subordinate Promissory Note ). The Subordinate Promissory Note bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (a) one-month LIBOR, (b) the Credit Facility Margin (as defined in the Subordinate Promissory Note) and (c)   1.75%  , with accrued interest payable monthly in arrears and principal due upon maturity on   September 22, 2017  . The Subordinate Promissory Note had an interest rate of   5.05%   as of   September 30, 2016  . In the event the Subordinate Promissory Note is not paid off on the maturity date, the loan includes default provisions. The Subordinate Promissory Note has been approved by a majority of the Company s board of directors (including a majority of the independent directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction as fair, competitive and commercially reasonable and no less favorable to the Company than a comparable loan between unaffiliated parties under the same circumstances. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $10.3 million   of debt outstanding and   $19.7 million   available for borrowing under the Subordinate Promissory Note. 
   
  NOTE 6   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Litigation 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company may become subject to litigation and claims. The Company is not aware of any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Company s business, to which the Company may become a party or of which the Company s properties may become the subject.

In addition, the Company may own or acquire certain properties that are subject to environmental remediation. Generally, the seller of the property, the tenant of the property and/or another third party is responsible for environmental remediation costs related to a property. Additionally, in connection with the purchase of certain properties, the respective sellers and/or tenants may agree to indemnify the Company against future remediation costs. The Company also carries environmental liability insurance on its properties that provides limited coverage for any remediation liability and/or pollution liability for third-party bodily injury and/or property damage claims for which the Company may be liable. The Company is not aware of any environmental matters which it believes are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Selling commissions and dealer manager fees 
  In connection with the Offering, CCC, the Company s dealer manager, which is affiliated with CCI III Advisors, receives selling commissions of up to   7.0%   and   3.0%   of gross offering proceeds from the primary portion of the Offering for Class A Shares and Class T Shares, respectively, and before reallowance of selling commissions earned by participating broker-dealers. The Company has been advised that CCC intends to reallow   100%   of selling commissions earned to participating broker-dealers. In addition, up to   2.0%   of gross offering proceeds from the primary portion of the Offering for both Class A Shares and Class T Shares before reallowance to participating broker-dealers will be paid to CCC as a dealer manager fee. CCC, in its sole discretion, may reallow all or a portion of its dealer manager fee to participating broker-dealers. No selling commissions or dealer manager fees are paid to CCC or other participating broker-dealers with respect to shares sold pursuant to the DRIP. No selling commissions and dealer manager fees were paid during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Distribution and stockholder servicing fees 
  The Company will pay CCC a distribution and stockholder servicing fee for Class T Shares that is calculated on a daily basis in the amount of 1/365th of   1.0%   of the purchase price per share (or, once reported, the amount of the Company s estimated per share net asset value) of the Class T Shares sold in the primary portion of the Offering. The distribution and stockholder servicing fee will be paid monthly in arrears from cash flow from operations or, if the Company s cash flow from operations is not sufficient to pay the distribution and stockholder servicing fee, from borrowings in anticipation of future cash flow. An estimated liability for future distribution and stockholder servicing fees payable to CCC is recognized at the time each Class T Share is sold and included in due to affiliates in the condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets with a corresponding decrease to capital in excess of par value. The Company will cease paying the distribution and stockholder servicing fee with respect to Class T Shares at the earliest of (i) the end of the month in which the transfer agent, on behalf of the Company, determines that total distribution and stockholder servicing fees paid by a stockholder within his or her individual account would be equal to   4.0%   of the stockholder s total gross investment amount at the time of the purchase of the primary Class T Shares held in such account; (ii) the date on which the aggregate underwriting compensation from all sources equals   10.0%   of the gross proceeds from the sale of the Company s shares in the Offering, excluding shares sold pursuant to the DRIP; (iii) the fourth anniversary of the last day of the month in which the Offering (excluding the offering of shares pursuant to the DRIP) terminates; (iv) the date such Class T Share is no longer outstanding; and (v) the date the Company effects a liquidity event. CCC may, in its discretion, reallow to participating broker-dealers all or a portion of the distribution and stockholder servicing fee for services that such participating broker-dealers perform in connection with the distribution of Class T Shares.   No   distribution and stockholder servicing fees are paid to CCC or other participating broker-dealers with respect to shares sold pursuant to the DRIP. During the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , no distribution and stockholder servicing fees had been paid, as no Class T Shares had been sold as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Organization and offering expenses 
  All other organization and offering expenses associated with the sale of the Company s common stock (excluding selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees) are paid by CCI III Advisors or its affiliates and are reimbursed by the Company up to   1.0%   of aggregate gross offering proceeds. A portion of the other organization and offering expenses may be considered to be underwriting compensation. As of   September 30, 2016  , CCI III Advisors had paid organization and offering expenses in excess of the   1.0%   of aggregate gross offering proceeds in connection with the Offering. These excess amounts were not included in the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements of the Company because such amounts were not a liability of the Company as they exceeded   1.0%   of gross proceeds from the Offering. As the Company raises additional proceeds from the Offering, these amounts may become payable. 
  Acquisition fees and expenses 
  The Company pays CCI III Advisors or its affiliates acquisition fees of up to   2.0%   of: (i) the contract purchase price of each property or asset the Company acquires; (ii) the amount paid in respect of the development, construction or improvement of each asset the Company acquires; (iii) the purchase price of any loan the Company acquires; and (iv) the principal amount of any loan the Company originates. In addition, the Company reimburses CCI III Advisors or its affiliates for acquisition-related expenses incurred in the process of acquiring a property or the origination or acquisition of a loan, so long as the total acquisition fees and expenses relating to the transaction do not exceed   6.0%   of the contract purchase price.

Advisory fees  
   Pursuant to the advisory agreement, the Company pays CCI III Advisors a monthly advisory fee based upon the Company s monthly average invested assets, which is equal to the following amounts: (i) an annualized rate of   0.75%   paid on the Company s average invested assets that are between   $0   to   $2.0 billion  ; (ii) an annualized rate of   0.70%   paid on the Company s average invested assets that are between   $2.0 billion   and   $4.0 billion  ; and (iii) an annualized rate of   0.65%   paid on the Company s average invested assets that are over   $4.0 billion  .  
  Operating expenses 
  The Company reimburses CCI III Advisors or its affiliates for the operating expenses they paid or incurred in connection with the services provided to the Company, subject to the limitation that the Company will not reimburse CCI III Advisors or its affiliates for any amount by which the operating expenses (including the advisory fee) at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceed the greater of (i)   2.0%   of average invested assets, or (ii)   25.0%   of net income, other than any additions to reserves for depreciation, bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of assets for that period. The Company will not reimburse CCI III Advisors or its affiliates for personnel costs in connection with the services for which CCI III Advisors or its affiliates receive an acquisition fee, financing coordination fee or disposition fee. No operating expenses were reimbursed during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Financing coordination fees 
  If CCI III Advisors provides services in connection with the origination, assumption or refinancing of any debt to acquire properties or to make other permitted investments, the Company will pay CCI III Advisors a financing coordination fee equal to   1.0%   of the amount available and/or outstanding under such financing. However, CCI III Advisors will not be entitled to a financing coordination fee on any debt where a fee was previously received unless (i) the maturity date of the refinanced debt was scheduled to occur less than one year after the date of the refinancing and the new loan has a term of at least five years or (ii) the new loan is approved by a majority of our independent directors; and provided, further, that no financing coordination fee will be paid in connection with loans advanced by an affiliate of CCI III Advisors. 
  Disposition fees 
  If CCI III Advisors or its affiliates provide a substantial amount of services (as determined by a majority of the Company s independent directors) in connection with the sale of one or more properties (or the Company s entire portfolio), the Company will pay CCI III Advisors or its affiliates a disposition fee in an amount equal to up to one-half of the real estate or brokerage commission paid by the Company to third parties on the sale of such properties, not to exceed   1.0%   of the contract price of the properties sold; provided, however, in no event may the total disposition fees paid to CCI III Advisors, its affiliates, and unaffiliated third parties, exceed the lesser of the customary competitive real estate commission or an amount equal to   6.0%   of the contract sales price. In addition, if CCI III Advisors or its affiliates provides a substantial amount of services (as determined by a majority of the Company s independent directors) in connection with the sale of one or more assets other than properties, the Company may separately compensate CCI III Advisors or its affiliates at such rates and in such amounts as the Company s board of directors, including a majority of the independent directors, and CCI III Advisors agree upon, not to exceed an amount equal to   1.0%   of the contract price of the assets sold. During the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     no   disposition fees were incurred for any such services provided by CCI III Advisors or its affiliates.  
  Subordinated performance fees 
  The Company will pay a subordinated performance fee under one of the following alternative events: (1) if the Company s shares are listed on a national securities exchange, CCI III Advisors, or its affiliates, will be entitled to a subordinated performance fee equal to   15.0%   of the amount, if any, by which (i) the market value of the Company s outstanding stock plus distributions paid by the Company prior to listing, exceeds (ii) the sum of the total amount of capital raised from investors and the amount of distributions necessary to generate a   6.0%   annual cumulative, non-compounded return to investors; (2) if the Company is sold or its assets are liquidated, CCI III Advisors will be entitled to a subordinated performance fee equal to   15.0%   of the net sale proceeds remaining after investors have received, from regular distributions plus special distributions paid from proceeds of such sale, a return of their net capital invested and a   6.0%   annual cumulative, non-compounded return; or (3) upon termination of the advisory agreement, CCI III Advisors may be entitled to a subordinated performance fee similar to the fee to which it would have been entitled had the portfolio been liquidated (based on an independent appraised value of the portfolio) on the date of termination. During the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   no   subordinated performance fees were incurred related to any such events.

Such statements include, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies, and prospects and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as well as known and unknown risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated. Therefore, such statements are not intended to be a guarantee of our performance in future periods. Such forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as  may,   would,   could,   should,   expect,   intend,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   continue,  or other similar words. Forward-looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our management s view only as of the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. Additionally, we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results.

  The following are some, but not all, of the assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements: 
             
    We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all. 
                
    We are subject to risks associated with tenant, geographic and industry concentrations with respect to our properties. 
                
    Our properties, intangible assets and other assets may be subject to impairment charges. 
                
    We could be subject to unexpected costs or unexpected liabilities that may arise from potential dispositions and may be unable to dispose of properties on advantageous terms. 
                
    We are subject to competition in the acquisition and disposition of properties and in the leasing of our properties and we may be unable to acquire, dispose of, or lease properties on advantageous terms. 
                
    We could be subject to risks associated with bankruptcies or insolvencies of tenants or from tenant defaults generally. 
                
    We have substantial indebtedness, which may affect our ability to pay distributions, and expose us to interest rate fluctuation risk and the risk of default under our debt obligations. 
                
    We may be affected by the incurrence of additional secured or unsecured debt. 
                
    We may not be able to achieve profitability. 
                
    We may not generate cash flows sufficient to pay our distributions to stockholders or meet our debt service obligations.  
                
    We may be affected by risks resulting from losses in excess of insured limits.  
                
    We may fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
                
    Our sponsor may be unable to fully reestablish the financial network which previously participated in offerings sponsored by Cole Capital and/or regain the prior level of transaction and capital raising volume.

Definitions 
  We use certain defined terms throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have the following meanings: 
  The phrase  annualized rental income  refers to the straight line rental revenue under our leases on operating properties owned as of the respective reporting date, which includes the effect of rent escalations and any tenant concessions, such as free rent, and excludes any bad debt allowances and any contingent rent, such as percentage rent. Management uses annualized rental income as a basis for tenant, industry and geographic concentrations and other metrics within the portfolio. Annualized rental income is not indicative of future performance. 
  Under a  net lease,  the tenant occupying the leased property (usually as a single tenant) does so in much the same manner as if the tenant were the owner of the property. There are various forms of net leases, most typically classified as triple net or double net. Triple net leases typically require the tenant to pay all expenses associated with the property (  e.g.  , real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs). Double net leases typically require that the tenant pay all operating expenses associated with the property (  e.g.  , real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance), but excludes some or all major repairs (  e.g.  , roof, structure and parking lot). Accordingly, the owner receives the rent  net  of these expenses, rendering the cash flow associated with the lease predictable for the term of the lease. Under a net lease, the tenant generally agrees to lease the property for a significant term and agrees that it will either have no ability or only limited ability to terminate the lease or abate rent prior to the expiration of the term of the lease as a result of real estate driven events such as casualty, condemnation or failure by the landlord to fulfill its obligations under the lease. 
   
  Overview 
  We were formed on   May 22, 2014  , and we intend to qualify and elect to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016. We commenced principal operations on   September 22, 2016   when we satisfied the minimum offering conditions of our escrow agreement and issued approximately   275,000   shares of our common stock in the Offering. We have no paid employees and are externally advised and managed by CCI III Advisors. VEREIT indirectly owns and/or controls our external advisor, CCI III Advisors, our dealer manager, CCC, our property manager, CREI Advisors, and our sponsor, Cole Capital. 
  As we acquire additional commercial real estate, we will be subject to changes in real estate prices and changes in interest rates on any current variable rate debt, refinancings or new indebtedness used to acquire the properties. We may manage our risk of changes in real estate prices on future property acquisitions, when applicable, by entering into purchase agreements and loan commitments simultaneously, or through loan assumptions, so that our operating yield is determinable at the time we enter into a purchase agreement, by contracting with developers for future delivery of properties, or by entering into sale-leaseback transactions. We manage our interest rate risk by monitoring the interest rate environment in connection with our future property acquisitions, when applicable, or upcoming debt maturities to determine the appropriate financing or refinancing terms, which may include fixed rate loans, variable rate loans or interest rate hedges. If we are unable to acquire suitable properties or obtain suitable financing terms for future acquisitions or refinancing, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 
  Our operating results and cash flows are primarily influenced by rental income from our commercial property, interest expense on our indebtedness, and acquisition and operating expenses. Rental income accounted for   100%   of total revenue for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . As   100%   of our rentable square feet was under lease as of   September 30, 2016  , with a remaining lease term of   9.6   years, we believe our exposure to changes in commercial rental rates on our portfolio is substantially mitigated, except for vacancies caused by tenant bankruptcies or other factors. Our advisor regularly monitors the creditworthiness of our tenants by reviewing the tenants  financial results, credit rating agency reports, when available, on the tenant or guarantor, the operating history of the property with such tenant, the tenant s market share and track record within its industry segment, the general health and outlook of the tenant s industry segment, and other information for changes and possible trends. If our advisor identifies significant changes or trends that may adversely affect the creditworthiness of a tenant, it will gather a more in-depth knowledge of the tenant s financial condition and, if necessary, attempt to mitigate the tenant credit risk by evaluating the possible sale of the property, or identifying a possible replacement tenant should the current tenant fail to perform on the lease. 
   
  Portfolio Information 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   one   property comprising approximately   221,000   rentable square feet of income-producing necessity corporate office space located in   one   state, which was   100%   leased with a lease term remaining of   9.6   years. As we have only acquired one property, a discussion of same store sales is not considered meaningful and as such is not included in the results of operations.

Results of Operations 
  As we did not commence principal operations until   September 22, 2016  , comparative financial data is not presented for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Additionally, we acquired our first property on September 23, 2016 and as such, our operating results reflect only eight days of activity. 
  Revenue for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   consisted of rental income of   $60,000   related to our property, which accounted for   100%   of total revenue. 
  General and administrative expenses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   totaled   $34,000  , primarily consisting of advisor fees, legal fees, board of directors costs, and unused fees on the Credit Facility. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , depreciation and amortization expenses were   $60,000   and acquisition-related expenses totaled   $755,000  . 
  Advisory fees and expenses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   totaled   $5,400  . Pursuant to the advisory agreement with CCI III Advisors and based upon the amount of our current invested assets, we are required to pay to CCI III Advisors a monthly advisory fee equal to one-twelfth of   0.75%   of the average invested assets, up to   $2.0 billion  , one-twelfth of   0.70%   of the average invested assets over   $2.0 billion   up to   $4.0 billion   and one-twelfth of   0.65%   of assets over   $4.0 billion  . Additionally, we may be required to reimburse certain expenses incurred by CCI III Advisors in providing such advisory services, subject to limitations as set forth in the advisory agreement. 
  Our   2016     Acquisition   was financed with net proceeds from our Offering and borrowings from the Credit Facility and the Subordinate Promissory Note. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $53,000   of interest expense due to debt outstanding of   $32.3 million  . 
   
  Distributions 
  Our board of directors authorized a daily distribution, based on   366   days in the calendar year, of   $0.001639344   per Class A Share for stockholders of record of such class of shares as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on   September 23, 2016   and ending on December 31, 2016. Our board of directors authorized a daily distribution on Class T Shares to the Company s stockholders of record of such class of shares as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on the date that the first Class T Share is sold in the Offering and ending on December 31, 2016, equal to   $0.001639344   per Class T Share, less the per share distribution and stockholder servicing fees that are payable with respect to the Class T Shares (as calculated on a daily basis). As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had distributions payable of   $3,865  . 
  In addition, our board of directors authorized a daily distribution, based on 365 days in the calendar year, of $0.001643836  per Class A Share for stockholders of record of such class of shares as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on January 1, 2017 and ending on March 31, 2017. Our board of directors authorized a daily distribution on Class T Shares to our stockholders of record of such class of shares as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on January 1, 2017 and ending on March 31, 2017, equal to $0.001643836 per Class T Share, less the per share distribution and stockholder servicing fees that are payable with respect to the Class T Shares (as calculated on a daily basis). 
   
  Share Redemptions 
  Our share redemption program permits our stockholders to sell their shares back to us after they have held them for at least one year, subject to conditions and limitations. We may waive the one-year holding period requirement upon request due to a stockholder s death or bankruptcy or other exigent circumstances as determined by our advisor. In addition, our board of directors may choose to amend the terms of, suspend or terminate our share redemption program at any time upon 30 days  notice. We will not redeem in excess of 5.0% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the trailing 12 months prior to the end of the fiscal quarter for which the redemptions are being paid. Funding for the redemption of shares will be limited to the net proceeds we receive from the sale of shares under the DRIP, net of shares redeemed to date. In addition, we will generally limit quarterly redemptions to approximately 1.25% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the trailing 12-month period ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the redemptions are being paid, and to the net proceeds we receive from the sale of shares in the respective quarter under the DRIP.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  General  
  We expect to utilize funds from the Offering and future proceeds from secured or unsecured financing to complete future property acquisitions and for general corporate uses. Our operating cash flows will primarily be provided by the rental income received from leased properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had raised $2.5 million in gross proceeds from the Offering before offering costs, selling commissions and dealer manager fees of $27,473.  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

Our Credit Facility and Subordinate Promissory Note provide for aggregate borrowings of up to $130.0 million. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $97.7 million in unused capacity, subject to borrowing availability. As of   September 30, 2016  , we also had cash and cash equivalents of   $248,503  . 
  Short-term Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  We expect our operating cash flows to increase as we continue to acquire properties. On a short-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for the acquisition of real estate investments and the payment of acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses, distributions to stockholders and interest and principal on current and any future debt financings. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash flows provided by operations and proceeds from the Offering, as well as secured or unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders to finance our future acquisitions. We believe that the resources stated above will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for the foreseeable future, and we do not anticipate a need to raise funds from sources other than those described above within the next 12 months. 
  Long-term Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  On a long-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for the acquisition of real estate and real estate-related investments and the payment of tenant improvements, acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses, distributions and redemptions to stockholders and interest and principal on any current and future indebtedness. Generally, we expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through proceeds from net cash flows provided by operations and secured or unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders. 
  We expect that substantially all net cash flows from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after certain capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions, are paid; however, we may use other sources to fund distributions, as necessary, including proceeds from the Offering, borrowings on our Credit Facility and/or future borrowings on unencumbered assets. To the extent that cash flows from operations are lower due to fewer properties being acquired or lower than expected returns on the properties, distributions paid to our stockholders may be lower. We expect that substantially all net cash flows from the Offering or debt financings will be used to fund acquisitions, certain capital expenditures, repayments of outstanding debt or distributions to our stockholders. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $32.3 million   of debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of   3.9%  . See Note 5   Credit Facility and Subordinate Promissory Note to our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for certain terms of our debt outstanding. 
  Our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

(1) 
    The table does not include amounts due to CCI III Advisors or its affiliates pursuant to our advisory agreement because such amounts are not fixed and determinable.   
              (2) 
    Payment obligations for the Revolving Loans are based on the interest rate in effect of   3.3%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
      We expect to incur additional borrowings in the future to acquire additional properties and make other real estate-related investments. There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow against any single improved property. Our borrowings will not exceed 75% of the cost of our gross assets (or 300% of net assets) as of the date of any borrowing, which is the maximum level of indebtedness permitted under the North American Securities Administrators Association REIT Guidelines; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors. Our board of directors has adopted a policy to further limit our borrowings to 60% of the greater of cost (before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves) or fair  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

market value of our gross assets, unless the excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in the next quarterly report along with the justification for such excess borrowing.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our ratio of debt to total gross real estate assets net of gross intangible lease liabilities was   98.6%  , which exceeded the 60% and 75% limitations. A majority of our board of directors (including a majority of the independent directors) determined that, as a general policy, borrowing in excess of the 60% limitation is justified and in the best interests of us and our stockholders during our capital raising stage. A majority of our board of directors (including a majority of the independent directors) also determined that borrowing in excess of the 75% limitation is justified and in the best interests of the Company s shareholders until March 31, 2017, and may be extended or re-approved by our board of directors and our independent directors from time to time. The independent directors believed such borrowing levels are justified for the following reasons:  
             
    the borrowings enabled us to purchase an initial property and earn rental income more quickly; 
                
    the property acquisition was likely to increase the net offering proceeds from the Offering by allowing us to show potential investors actual acquisitions, thereby improving our ability to meet our objective of acquiring a diversified portfolio of properties to generate current income for investors and preserve investor capital; and 
                
    based on expected equity sales, the high leverage is likely to exceed our charter s guidelines only for a limited period of time. 
     Our management reviews net debt as part of its management of our overall liquidity, financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage, and we therefore believe that the presentation of net debt provides useful information to investors. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure used to show the Company s outstanding principal debt balance, excluding certain GAAP adjustments, such as premiums or discounts, less all cash and cash equivalents. As of   September 30, 2016  , our net debt leverage ratio, which is the ratio of net debt to total gross real estate assets net of gross intangible lease liabilities, if applicable, was   97.9%  . The following table provides a reconciliation of the credit facility and subordinate promissory note due to affiliate, net balance, as reported on our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet, to net debt as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

Cash Flow Analysis 
  Operating Activities.   Net cash   used in   operating activities was   $496,100   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily due to   $754,500   of acquisition costs for the 2016 Acquisition, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of   $237,800  . See     Results of Operations  for a more complete discussion of the factors impacting our operating performance.  
  Investing Activities.   Net cash   used in   investing activities was   $32.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , resulting from the purchase of the 2016 Acquisition. 
  Financing Activities.   Net cash   provided by   financing activities was   $33.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of   $2.5 million   and net proceeds from the Credit Facility and the Subordinate Promissory Note of   $32.3 million  . 
   
  Election as a REIT  
  We intend to qualify and elect to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016. To qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we must meet certain requirements relating to our organization, sources of income, nature of assets, distributions of income to our stockholders and recordkeeping. However, we cannot guarantee that we will meet these requirements, and may not elect to be taxed as a REIT for our taxable year ending December 31, 2016 if we do not meet such requirements. If we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders so long as we distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains).  
  If we do not elect to be taxed as a REIT, or if we otherwise fail to qualify as a REIT for any reason in a taxable year and applicable relief provisions do not apply, we will be subject to tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income, if any, at regular corporate rates. We will not be able to deduct distributions paid to our stockholders in any year in which we elect not to be taxed or fail to qualify as a REIT. If we elect to be taxed and fail to qualify as a REIT in any  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

taxable year, we also will be disqualified for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we intend to be organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the year ending December 31, 2016. As such, no provision for federal income taxes has been made in our accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements. We are subject to certain state and local taxes related to the operations of properties in certain locations, which have been provided for in our accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We consider our critical accounting policies to be the following: 
             
    Allocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate Assets; and 
                
    Recoverability of Real Estate Assets. 
     A complete description of such policies and our considerations is contained in the Registration Statement, and our critical accounting policies have not changed from September 22, 2016 to   September 30, 2016  . The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   and related notes thereto, which is contained in the Registration Statement. 
  Related-Party Transactions and Agreements 
  We have entered into agreements with CCI III Advisors and its affiliates, whereby we agree to pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, CCI III Advisors or its affiliates, such as acquisition and advisory fees and expenses, organization and offering costs, selling commissions, dealer manager fees and expenses, distribution and stockholder servicing fees, leasing fees and reimbursement of certain operating costs. See Note 7   Related-Party Transactions and Arrangements to our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees. 
  Conflicts of Interest 
  Affiliates of CCI III Advisors act as an advisor to, and our chief financial officer and our chief executive officer act as executive officers and/or directors of, Cole Credit Property Trust IV, Inc., Cole Credit Property Trust V, Inc., Cole Office   Industrial REIT (CCIT II), Inc., Cole Real Estate Income Strategy (Daily NAV), Inc., and/or other real estate offerings in registration, all of which are REITs offered, distributed and/or managed by affiliates of CCI III Advisors. As such, there are conflicts of interest where CCI III Advisors or its affiliates, while serving in the capacity as sponsor, general partner, officer, director, key personnel and/or advisor for VEREIT or another real estate program sponsored by Cole Capital, including other real estate offerings in registration, may be in conflict with us in connection with providing services to other real estate-related programs related to property acquisitions, property dispositions, and property management among others. The compensation arrangements between affiliates of CCI III Advisors and these other real estate programs sponsored by Cole Capital could influence the advice provided to us. See  Conflicts of Interest  included in the Registration Statement.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
     Market Risk 
  The market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or interest rates. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to variable-rate borrowings. To meet our short and long-term liquidity requirements, we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes in earnings and cash flows and to manage our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. We would not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We do not have any foreign operations and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.  
  In connection with the acquisition of our properties, we have obtained variable rate debt financing and are therefore exposed to changes in LIBOR. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an aggregate of   $32.3 million   of variable rate debt outstanding under the Subordinate Promissory Note and the Credit Facility, and a change of 50 basis points in interest rates would result in a change in interest expense of   $162,000   per annum. In the future, we may obtain additional variable rate debt financing to fund certain property acquisitions and may be further exposed to interest rate changes. Our objectives in managing interest rate risks will be to limit the impact of interest rate changes on operations and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we expect to borrow primarily at interest rates with the lowest margins available and, in some cases, with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates. 
  Credit Risk  
  Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of tenants are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to the Company, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. We have one tenant and are subject to tenant, geographic and industry concentrations and will be subject to such concentrations as we grow our portfolio. Any downturn of the economic conditions in our current tenant or in one or more of our future tenants, states or industries could result in a material reduction of our cash flows or material losses to us.  
  The factors considered in determining the credit risk of our current tenant and future tenants include, but are not limited to: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. We believe that the credit risk of our portfolio is reduced by the high quality of our existing tenant, reviews of prospective tenants  risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problems with our current or future tenants. 
   
  Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that no controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
  As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of   September 30, 2016   was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of   September 30, 2016  , were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
     On   July 14, 2014  , we sold   8,000   shares of common stock, at   $25.00   per share, to VEREIT, the indirect owner of our advisor and dealer manager. On September 22, 2016, our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (Registration No. 333-209128) for the offering of up to   $2.5 billion   in shares of common stock in the primary portion of the Offering, consisting of two classes of shares, Class A Shares at a price of   $10.00   per share (up to   $1.25 billion   in shares) and Class T Shares at a price of   $9.57   per share (up to   $1.25 billion   in shares), subject to reduction in certain circumstances, was declared effective under the Securities Act. The Registration Statement also covers the offering of up to   $1.0 billion   in shares of common stock pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan, under which stockholders may elect to have distributions reinvested in additional shares at a price of   $9.10   per share for both Class A Shares and Class T Shares, assuming a   $10.00   per Class A Share primary offering price and a   $9.57   per Class T Share primary offering price. 
  On September 22, 2016, we satisfied the conditions of the escrow agreement regarding the minimum offering amount under the Offering and issued   274,725   Class A Shares to VEREIT OP, resulting in gross proceeds of   $2.5 million  , and commenced principal operations.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had issued   274,725   shares of our common stock in the Offering for gross offering proceeds of   $2.5 million  . With the net offering proceeds and additional indebtedness, we acquired   $32.8 million   in real estate assets and incurred acquisition costs of   $755,000  . As of   November 7, 2016  , we have sold   274,725   Class A Shares and   no   Class T Shares in the Offering for gross offering proceeds of   $2.5 million  .

  Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  Cole Office   Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc., a Maryland corporation (the    Company   ), is registering for a public sale a maximum of $3,500,000,000 in shares (collectively, the    Shares    or the    Stock   ) of its common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the    Offering   ) consisting of (a) up to $2,500,000,000 in shares of common stock in the primary offering in any combination of the following two classes of common stock: Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (   Class A Shares   ), and Class T common stock, $0.01 par value per share (   Class T Shares   ), at an initial price of $10.00 per share and $9.57 per share, respectively (subject in certain circumstances to discounts based upon the volume of shares purchased and for certain categories of purchasers), and (b) up to $1,000,000,000 in Shares pursuant to the Company s distribution reinvestment plan at a purchase price during the Offering equal to the per share primary offering price net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, or $9.10 per share for both Class A Shares and Class T Shares, assuming a $10.00 per Class A Share primary offering price and a $9.57 per Class T Share primary offering price, all upon the other terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Prospectus (as defined in Section 1.1, below). Commencing with the date the Company calculates its net asset value (   NAV   ), which the Company shall calculate no later than 150 days following the date which is two years after the gross proceeds of the Shares sold have reached the minimum offering amount set forth in the Prospectus (the    Minimum Offering   ) and are disbursed to the Company pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (as defined in Section 3.5, below) (the    NAV Pricing Date   ), the per share price for Shares in our primary offering and our distribution reinvestment plan will vary annually and will be equal to the most recent NAV as determined by the Company divided by the number of Shares outstanding as of the date of the Company s most recent NAV determination, plus, in the case of the primary offering, applicable commissions and fees. The Company reserves the right to reallocate the Shares included in the Offering among the classes of Shares and between those offered to the public and those offered pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan. There shall be a minimum purchase by any one person of 100 Shares (except as otherwise indicated in the Prospectus or in any letter or memorandum from the Company to Cole Capital Corporation (the    Dealer Manager   )). Terms not defined in this Dealer Manager Agreement (the    Agreement   ) shall have the same meaning as in the Prospectus. In connection therewith, the Company hereby agrees with you, the Dealer Manager, as follows: 
  1.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRENTIES OF THE COMPANY  .  As an inducement to the Dealer Manager to enter into this Agreement, the Company represents and warrants to the Dealer Manager that: 
  1.1.

the Shares. Such registration statement, including any amendment thereto filed prior to the date hereof, has become effective. Copies of such registration statement and each amendment thereto have been or will be delivered to the Dealer Manager. The registration statement and prospectus contained therein, as finally amended at the effective date of the registration statement, are respectively hereinafter referred to as the    Registration Statement    and the    Prospectus  ,  except that if the Company files a Prospectus or a prospectus supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, or if the Company files a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, the term  Prospectus  includes the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or the prospectus included in such post-effective amendment.    Effective Date    shall mean each date and time that the Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment or amendments thereto became or becomes effective. 
  1.2.   On the Effective Date, the Registration Statement did, and when the Prospectus is first filed in accordance with Rule 424(b), the Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) will, comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act; on the Effective Date and on the date hereof, the Registration Statement did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; and on the date of any filing pursuant to Rule 424(b), the Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  
  1.3.

The offers and sales of the outstanding securities of the Company were at all relevant times either registered under the Securities Act, the applicable state securities or  blue sky  laws, or, based in part on the representations and warranties of the purchasers of such securities, exempt from such registration requirements. The holders of outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are not entitled to preemptive or other rights to subscribe for the Shares; and, except as set forth in the Prospectus and for the Company s distribution reinvestment plan, no options, warrants or other rights to purchase, agreements or other obligations to issue, or rights to convert any obligations into or exchange any securities for, shares of capital stock of or ownership interests in the Company are outstanding. 
  1.6.  At the time of the issuance of the Shares, the Shares will have been duly authorized and validly issued, and upon payment therefor, will be fully paid and nonassessable and will conform to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus.

  1.11.  No action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Company or its property is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened that (i) could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the performance of this Agreement by the Company or (ii) could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, prospects, earnings, business or properties of the Company, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Prospectus. 
  1.12.  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the issue and sale of the Shares nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company pursuant to (i) the charter or by-laws of the Company, (ii) the terms of any indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which the Company is a party or bound or to which its property is subject, or (iii) any statute, law, rule, or regulation, judgment, order or decree applicable to the Company of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties, except to the extent that the enforceability of the indemnity and/or contribution provisions contained in Section 4 of this Agreement may be limited under applicable securities laws.

  1.15.  The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus, will not be an  investment company  as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
  1.16.  To the best of the Company s knowledge, Deloitte   Touche LLP, who have certified certain of the financial statements filed with the SEC as part of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, is an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company as required by  
  
   3 

the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations thereof and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
  2.  COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY  .  The Company covenants and agrees with the Dealer Manager that: 
  2.1.  Prior to the termination of the offering of the Shares, the Company will file every amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that may be required by the SEC. The Company will cause the Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed. The Company will promptly advise the Dealer Manager (i) when the Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b), (ii) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Shares, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the occurrence of any such suspension or objection to the use of the Registration Statement and, upon such issuance, occurrence or notice of objection, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable. 
  2.2.  If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Shares is required to be delivered under the Securities Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made or the circumstances then prevailing not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Securities Act or the rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (i) prepare and file with the SEC, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; and (ii) supply any supplemented Prospectus to the Dealer Manager in such quantities as it may reasonably request. 
  2.3.  The Company will, at no expense to the Dealer Manager, furnish the Dealer Manager with such number of printed copies of the Registration Statement, including all supplements, amendments and exhibits thereto, as the Dealer Manager may reasonably request. It will similarly furnish to the Dealer Manager, and others designated by the Dealer Manager, as many copies as the Dealer Manager may reasonably request in connection with the offering of the Shares of: (a) the Prospectus in preliminary and final form and every form of supplemental or amended prospectus; (b) this Agreement; and (c) any other printed sales literature or other materials (provided that the use of said sales literature and other materials has been first approved for use by the Company and all appropriate regulatory agencies). 
  2.4.  The Company will endeavor in good faith, in cooperation with the Dealer Manager, to qualify the Shares for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Dealer Manager may reasonably designate and use all reasonable efforts to file and make such statements or reports at such times as are or may be required to continue the qualification of the Shares for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. The Company will furnish to the Dealer Manager a copy of such papers filed by the Company in connection with any such qualification.

3.  OBLIGATIONS AND COMPENSATION OF DEALER MANAGER  . 
  3.1.  The Company hereby appoints the Dealer Manager as its agent and principal distributor for the purpose of selling for cash up to a maximum of $3,500,000,000 in Shares (or such other amount as the Company allocates to the primary Offering of Shares as described in the first paragraph of this Agreement) through the dealers selected to participate in the distribution of Shares in the Offering who have executed Selected Dealer Agreements with the Dealer Manager (each, a    Dealer    and, collectively, the    Dealers   ), all of whom shall be members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (   FINRA   ). The Dealer Manager may also sell Shares for cash directly to its own clients and customers at the public offering price and subject to the terms and conditions stated in the Prospectus. The Dealer Manager hereby accepts such agency and distributorship and agrees to use its best efforts to sell the Shares on said terms and conditions. The Dealer Manager represents to the Company that (i) it is a member of FINRA; (ii) it and its employees and representatives have all required licenses and registrations to act under this Agreement; and (iii) it has established and implemented anti-money laundering compliance programs in accordance with applicable law, including applicable FINRA rules, SEC rules, and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, reasonably designed to detect and cause the reporting of suspicious transactions in connection with the sale of Shares of the Company. 
  3.2.  Promptly after the effective date of the Registration Statement, the Dealer Manager and the Dealers shall commence the offering of the Shares for cash to the public only in jurisdictions in which the Shares are registered or qualified for sale or in which such offering is otherwise permitted. The Dealer Manager and the Dealers will suspend or terminate offering of the Shares upon request of the Company at any time and will resume offering the Shares upon subsequent request of the Company. 
  3.3.  Except as provided in the  Plan of Distribution  section of the Prospectus, as compensation for the services rendered by the Dealer Manager, the Company agrees that it will pay to the Dealer Manager selling commissions in the amount of 7.0% of the gross proceeds of the Class A Shares sold and 3.0% of the gross proceeds of the Class T Shares sold, plus a dealer manager fee in the amount of 2.0% of the gross proceeds of the Shares sold to the public; provided, however, that there shall be no selling commissions and no dealer manager fees paid for sales of Shares under the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. In addition, the Company agrees that it will pay to the Dealer Manager a monthly distribution and stockholder servicing fee that will be calculated on a daily basis in an amount equal to 1/365th of 1.0% of the purchase price per share (or, once reported by the Company, the amount of the Company s NAV per share) of Class T Shares sold, excluding Class T Shares sold pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan. The Company will cease paying the distribution and stockholder servicing fee with respect to Class T Shares sold in the Offering at the earliest of (i) the date at which the aggregate underwriting compensation from all sources equals 10.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of Shares, excluding Shares sold pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan; (ii) the end of the month in which the transfer agent, on behalf of the Company, determines that total distribution and stockholder servicing fees paid by a stockholder within his or her individual account would be equal to 4.0% of the stockholder s total gross investment amount at the time of the purchase of the primary Class T shares held in such account; (iii) the date such Class T share is no longer outstanding; (iv) the fourth anniversary of the last day of the month in which the Offering (excluding the offering of shares pursuant to the Company s distribution reinvestment plan) terminates; and (v) the date the Company effects a liquidity event. The distribution and stockholder servicing fee relates to the share or shares sold. Payments to the Dealer Manager shall be made by the end of the week following the week in which Shares are sold by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Dealer Manager. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Dealer Manager will reallow all of the selling commissions to Dealers. The Dealer Manager also may reallow all or a portion of the dealer manager fee and the distribution and  
  
   5 

stockholder servicing fee to Dealers; provided, however, that with respect to any individual investment, the Dealer Manager will not re-allow the related distribution and stockholder servicing fee to a Dealer if such Dealer ceases to hold the account related to such investment. In addition, the Dealer Manager will not reallow the distribution and stockholder servicing fee to any Dealer if such Dealer has not executed a Selected Dealer Agreement with the Dealer Manager or if the Dealer s previously executed Selected Dealer Agreement with the Dealer Manager is terminated. In any instance in which the Dealer Manager does not re-allow the distribution and stockholder servicing fee to a Dealer, the Dealer Manager will return such fee to the Company. If, for any reason, a sale is cancelled or rescinded, the Dealer Manager shall return to the Company the selling commission, the dealer manager fee and the distribution and stockholder servicing fee paid to it with respect to such sale. The Company will not be liable or responsible to any Dealer for direct payment of commissions to such Dealer, it being the sole and exclusive responsibility of the Dealer Manager to make payment of commissions to Dealers. Notwithstanding the above, at its discretion, the Company may act as agent of the Dealer Manager by making direct payment of commissions to such Dealers without incurring any liability therefore. 
  3.4.  The Dealer Manager shall use and distribute, in conjunction with the offer and sale of any Shares, only the Prospectus and such sales literature and advertising as shall have been previously approved in writing by the Company. 
  3.5.  The Dealer Manager agrees to be bound by the terms of an escrow agreement among UMB Bank, N.A., as escrow agent (the    Escrow Agent   ), the Dealer Manager and the Company (the    Escrow Agreement   ), in a form reasonably acceptable to the parties thereto, as such agreement may be amended from time to time. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.3 above, no commissions, payments or amounts whatsoever will be paid to the Dealer Manager unless or until the gross proceeds of the Shares sold have reached the Minimum Offering and are disbursed to the Company pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Until the Minimum Offering is reached, investments will be held in escrow. If the Minimum Offering is not obtained within the time periods specified in the Prospectus, investments will be returned to the investors in accordance with the Prospectus. Furthermore, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.3 above, no commissions, payments or amounts whatsoever will be paid to the Dealer Manager with respect to sales of Shares to Pennsylvania residents unless or until the gross proceeds of the Shares sold in the Offering (including sales made to residents of other jurisdictions) have reached a minimum of $125,000,000 (the    Pennsylvania Minimum Offering   ) and are disbursed to the Company pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Until the Pennsylvania Minimum Offering is reached, investments from Pennsylvania residents will be held in escrow. If the Pennsylvania Minimum Offering is not obtained, Pennsylvania residents may request a return of their funds in accordance with the Prospectus. Similarly, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.3 above, no commissions, payments or amounts whatsoever will be paid to the Dealer Manager with respect to sales of Shares to residents of any other state that has imposed a minimum offering amount higher than the Minimum Offering (a    State-Required Minimum Offering   ) unless or until the gross proceeds of the Shares sold in the Offering (including sales made to residents of other jurisdictions) have reached a minimum of the applicable State-Required Minimum Offering and are disbursed to the Company pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Until the applicable State-Required Minimum Offering is reached, investments from residents of that state will be held in escrow. If the applicable State-Required Minimum Offering is not obtained prior to the termination of the Offering, the investments from residents of that state will be promptly returned to them in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. 
  3.6.  The Dealer Manager acknowledges that the Company may reimburse its advisor for underwriting expenses not covered by the selling commissions, dealer manager fee and distribution and stockholder servicing fee set forth in Section 3.3, but only to the extent that the total of such reimbursements for underwriting expenses and the selling commissions, dealer manager fee and  
  
   6 

distribution and stockholder servicing fee set forth in Section 3.3 is no more than 10.0% of the gross offering proceeds of the Shares sold in the Offering, excluding proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan. In no event will total underwriting compensation exceed 10.0% of the gross proceeds of the Shares sold in the Offering, excluding proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan. 
  4.  INDEMNIFICATION. 
  4.1.  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Dealer Manager and the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Dealer Manager, each person who controls the Dealer Manager within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the    Exchange Act   ), and each affiliate of the Dealer Manager (such directors, officers, employees, agents, controlling persons and affiliates being referred to collectively as    Dealer Manager Affiliates    and, individually, as a    Dealer Manager Affiliate   ) against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (   Losses   ), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Shares as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or in any blue sky application or other document executed by the Company or on its behalf specifically for the purpose of qualifying any or all of the Shares for sale under the securities laws of any jurisdiction (a    Blue Sky Application   ), or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such Losses or action; provided, however , that the Company shall not indemnify or hold harmless the Dealer Manager or any Dealer Manager Affiliates in any such case to the extent that any such Loss arises out of, or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission in the information relating to the Dealer Manager that appears in the following sections of the Prospectus or any amendment thereof: Prospectus Summary - Our Dealer Manager; Management -Dealer Manager; and Plan of Distribution - Cole Capital Corporation (collectively, the    Dealer Manager Sections   ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not indemnify or hold harmless the Dealer Manager or any Dealer Manager Affiliates in any manner that would be inconsistent with the provisions of Section II.G. of the Statement of Policy Regarding Real Estate Investment Trusts of the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc., effective May 7, 2007, as may be amended (the    NASAA Guidelines   ). In particular, but without limitation, the Company shall not be required to provide indemnity or hold harmless any person under this Section 4.1 for any Loss or expense unless: (i) the person seeking indemnification has determined, in good faith, that its course of conduct was in the best interests of the Company; (ii) the person seeking indemnification was acting on behalf of or performing services on behalf of the Company; (iii) the Loss or expense was not the result of negligence or misconduct on the part of the person seeking indemnification; and (iv) any Loss or expense is recoverable only out of the net assets of the Company and not from the personal assets of the Company s stockholders. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.  
  In addition, the Company shall not indemnify or hold harmless the Dealer Manager or any Dealer Manager Affiliates for liabilities arising from or out of a violation of state or federal securities laws, unless one or more of the following conditions are met:

              (c) 
    a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims against the indemnitee and finds that indemnification of the settlement and the related costs should be made, and the court considering the request for indemnification has been advised of the position of the SEC and of the published position of any state securities regulatory authority in which the securities were offered as to indemnification for violations of securities laws. 
     The advancement of Company funds to the Dealer Manager or any Dealer Manager Affiliate for legal expenses and other costs incurred as a result of any legal action for which indemnification is being sought shall be permissible only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: 
           (a) 
    the legal action relates to acts or omissions with respect to the performance of duties or services on behalf of the Company; 
              (b) 
    the legal action is initiated by a third party who is not a stockholder of the Company or the legal action is initiated by a stockholder of the Company acting in his or her capacity as such and a court of competent jurisdiction specifically approves such advancement; and 
              (c) 
    the Dealer Manager or the Dealer Manager Affiliate undertakes to repay the advanced funds to the Company, together with the applicable legal rate of interest thereon, in cases in which the Dealer Manager or the Dealer Manager Affiliate is found not to be entitled to indemnification. 
     4.2.  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Dealer, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Dealer, each person who controls any Dealer within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each affiliate of each Dealer (such directors, officers, employees, agents, controlling persons and affiliates being referred to collectively as    Dealer Affiliates    and, individually, as a    Dealer Affiliate   ) against any and all Losses, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Shares as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such Losses or action; provided, however, that the Company shall not indemnify or hold harmless a Dealer or any of its Dealer Affiliates in any such case if it is determined that such Dealer was at fault in connection with the Loss. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not indemnify or hold harmless the Dealer or any Dealer Affiliates in any manner that would be inconsistent with the provisions of Section II.G. of the NASAA Guidelines. In particular, but without limitation, the Company shall not indemnify or hold harmless a Dealer or any of its Dealer Affiliates for liabilities arising from or out of a violation of state or federal securities laws, unless one or more of the following conditions are met: 
  
   8 

(a) 
    there has been a successful adjudication on the merits of each count involving alleged securities law violations; 
              (b) 
    such claims have been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction; or 
              (c)

4.5.  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 or 4.4 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under Section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 or 4.4, as the case may be, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under such Section of this Agreement unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in such Section of this Agreement. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party s choice at the indemnifying party s expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be subject to approval by the indemnified party, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party s election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel) selected by the indemnifying party, subject to approval by the indemnified party not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel for the indemnified party (subject to approval by the indemnified party not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party may settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder but may not do so without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. 
  4.6.  If the right to indemnification provided for in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 herein would by its terms be available to a person hereunder, but is held to be unavailable by a court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses and expenses in respect thereof, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company, the Dealer Manager and the Dealer, as applicable, in connection with the statements, omissions or other circumstances which resulted in such Losses or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. 
  The relative fault of the Company, the Dealer Manager and the Dealer, as applicable, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the parties  relative intent, knowledge, and access to information. It is understood that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4.6 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 4.6. 
  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4, the Dealer Manager or Dealer shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the total price of the Shares sold by it. 
  
   10 

No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 
  For purposes of this Section 4, each Company Affiliate shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, each Dealer Manager Affiliate shall have the same rights to contribution as the Dealer Manager and each Dealer Affiliate of a particular Dealer shall have the same rights to contribution as that Dealer. 
  5.  SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS  .  The respective agreements, representations and warranties of the Company and the Dealer Manager set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (a) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Dealer Manager or any Dealer or any person controlling the Dealer Manager or any Dealer or by or on behalf of the Company or any person controlling the Company, and (b) the acceptance of any payment for the Shares. 
  6.  APPLICABLE LAW; VENUE  .

  8.2.  This Agreement may be amended only by the written agreement of the Dealer Manager and the Company. 
  9.  TERM  .

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to the Dealer Manager all commissions and fees to which the Dealer Manager is or becomes entitled under Section 3 at such time as such commissions become payable. In such event, participating Dealers shall

  11.  SUITABILITY OF INVESTORS  .  The Dealer Manager will offer Shares, and in its agreements with Dealers will require that the Dealers offer Shares, only to persons who meet the financial qualifications set forth in the Prospectus and will only make offers to persons in the states in which it is advised in writing by the Company that the Shares are qualified for sale or that such qualification is not required. In offering Shares, the Dealer Manager will, and in its agreements with Dealers, the Dealer Manager will require that the Dealers will, comply with the provisions of all applicable rules and regulations relating to suitability of investors, including without limitation, the provisions of Article III of the NASAA Guidelines.

In making the determinations as to suitability, the Dealer Manager shall be entitled to rely on the Dealers and/or information provided by the purchasers. In addition, the Dealer Manager shall make every reasonable effort to determine that the purchase of the Shares is a suitable and appropriate investment for each purchaser. The Dealer Manager shall be entitled to rely on representations as to suitability provided by the Dealer based on information provided by such purchaser to the Dealer. In making its suitability determination, the Dealer will consider, based on the information provided by the purchaser, such purchaser s age, investment objectives, investment experience, income, net worth, financial situation, and other investments held by such purchaser, and whether the purchaser: meets the state specific minimum income and net worth standards set forth in the Suitability Standards section of the Prospectus for purchasers resident in those states; can reasonably benefit from an investment in the Shares based on his overall investment objectives and portfolio structure; is able to bear the economic risk of the investment based on his overall financial situation; and has an apparent understanding of the fundamental risks of an investment in the Shares, the risk that he may lose his entire investment, the lack of liquidity of the Shares, the restrictions on transferability of the Shares, the background and qualifications of the Company s advisor, and the tax, including ERISA, consequences of an investment in the Shares. With respect to the maintenance of records required by the NASAA Guidelines, the Company agrees that the Dealer Manager can satisfy its obligations by contractually requiring such information to be maintained by the Dealers for at least six (6) years.

In such case, the Dealer will collect the proceeds of the subscribers  checks and issue a check for the aggregate amount of the subscription proceeds, without any reductions or offset, made payable in the manner described above. Transmittal of received investor funds will be made in accordance with the following procedures: 
           (a)

  ARTICLE III 
  COMPENSATION 
  3.01       Fees  . 
           (a) 
    Advisory Fee  . On the last day of each month, the Company shall pay to the Advisor a monthly Advisory Fee based upon the monthly Average Invested Assets. The Advisory Fee shall be calculated according to the following schedule: 

The Advisory Fee shall be applied according to the above schedule for each level of monthly Average Invested Assets, resulting in a blended annualized rate for fees paid in respect of Average Invested Assets in excess of $2 billion. For example, the annualized rate for fees paid in respect of Average Invested Assets of $5 billion is 0.71% (  i.e.   the quotient of (1) the sum of (x) the product of $2 billion multiplied by 0.75%, and (y) the product of $2 billion multiplied by 0.70%, and (z) the product of $1 billion multiplied by 0.65%, divided by (2) $5 billion). Any portion of the Advisory Fee may be deferred and paid in a subsequent period upon the mutual agreement of the parties hereto. 
           (b) 
    Acquisition Fees  . The Company shall pay the Advisor, or an Affiliate of the Advisor, a fee in the amount of 2.0% of the Contract Purchase Price of each Asset as Acquisition Fees. The total of all Acquisition Fees and any Acquisition Expenses shall be limited in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation. Acquisition Fees shall be paid as follows: (1) for real property (including properties where development/redevelopment is expected), at the time of acquisition, (2) for development/redevelopment projects (other than the initial acquisition of the real property), at the time a final budget is approved, and (3) for loans and similar assets (including without limitation mezzanine loans), quarterly based on the value of loans made or acquired. In the case of a development/redevelopment project subject to clause (2) above, upon completion of the development/redevelopment project, the Advisor shall determine the actual amounts paid. To the extent the amounts actually paid vary from the budgeted amounts on which the Acquisition Fee was initially based, the Advisor will pay or invoice the Company for 2.0% of the budget variance such that the Acquisition Fee is ultimately 2.0% of amounts expended on such development/redevelopment project. Any portion of the Acquisition Fee may be deferred and paid in a subsequent period upon the mutual agreement of the parties hereto. 
              (c) 
    Subordinated Performance Fee  . The Company shall pay the Advisor a Subordinated Performance Fee in connection with any one of the following events: 
              (1) 
    Upon Listing, the Advisor shall be entitled to a Subordinated Performance Fee in an amount equal to 15.0% of the amount by which (i) the Market Value of the Company s outstanding Shares plus distributions paid by the Company prior to Listing, exceeds (ii) the sum of (A) 100% of Invested Capital and (B) the total Distributions required to be paid to the Stockholders in order to pay the Stockholders  6.0% Return from inception through the date that Market Value is determined. The Company shall have the option to pay such fee in the form of cash, Shares, a non-interest bearing promissory note, or any combination of the foregoing. If the Company pays such fee with a non-interest bearing promissory note, payment in full shall be made from the Net Sales Proceeds of the  
     
   9 

first Sale completed by the Company after Listing. If the Net Sales Proceeds from the first Sale after Listing are insufficient to pay the promissory note in full, then the promissory note shall be paid in part with such Net Sales Proceeds, and in part from the Net Sales Proceeds from the next successive Sale until the amount owing pursuant to such promissory note is paid in full. If the promissory note has not been paid in full within five years from the date of Listing, then the Advisor, or its successors or assigns, may elect to convert the unpaid balance into Shares at a price per Share equal to the average closing price of the Shares over the ten trading days immediately preceding the date of such election. If the Shares are no longer Listed at such time as the promissory note becomes convertible into Shares as provided by this paragraph, then the price per Share, for purposes of conversion, shall equal the fair market value for the Shares as determined by the Board based upon the Appraised Value of the Assets as of the date of election. 
           (2) 
    Upon a Sale of the Company or all of, or substantially all of, the Company s Assets, the Advisor shall be entitled to the Subordinated Performance Fee in an amount equal to 15.0% of Net Sale Proceeds remaining after the Stockholders have received Distributions equal to the sum of the Stockholders  6.0% Return and 100% of Invested Capital. The Company shall have the option to pay such fee in the form of cash, Shares, a non-interest bearing promissory note, or any combination of the foregoing. 
              (3) 
    Upon termination of this Agreement, unless such termination is by the Company because of a material breach of this Agreement by the Advisor or occurs upon a Change of Control, the Advisor shall be entitled to receive a payment of the Subordinated Performance Fee equal to 15.0% of the amount, if any, by which (i) the Appraised Value of the Assets, including any applicable portfolio premium or discount, on the Termination Date, less the amount of all indebtedness secured by the Assets, plus the total Distributions paid to Stockholders from the Company s inception through the Termination Date, exceeds (ii) Invested Capital plus an amount equal to the Stockholders  6.0% Return from inception through the Termination Date. The Company shall pay such Subordinated Performance Fee at such time as the Company completes the first Sale after the Termination Date. Payment shall be made from the Net Sales Proceeds of such Sale. The Company shall have the option to pay such fee in the form of cash, Shares, a non-interest bearing promissory note, or any combination of the foregoing. If the Net Sales Proceeds from the first Sale after the Termination Date are insufficient to pay the Subordinated Performance Fee in full, then the Subordinated Performance Fee shall be paid in part with such Net Sales Proceeds, and in part from the Net Sales Proceeds from the next successive Sale until the Subordinated Performance Fee is paid in full. If the Subordinated Performance Fee has not been paid in full within five years from the Termination Date, then the Advisor, its successors or assigns, may elect to convert the balance of the fee into Shares at a price per Share equal to the average closing price of the Shares over the ten trading days immediately preceding the date of such election if the Shares are Listed at such time. If the Shares are not Listed at such time, the Advisor, its successors or assigns, may elect to convert the balance of the fee into Shares at a price per Share equal to the fair market value for the Shares as reasonably determined by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if termination occurs upon a Change of Control, the Advisor shall be entitled to payment of the Subordinated Performance Fee equal to 15.0% of the amount, if any, by which (i) the value of the Assets on the Termination Date as determined in good faith by the Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors, based upon such factors as the consideration paid in connection with the Change of Control and the most recent Appraised Value of the Assets, including any applicable portfolio premium or discount, less the amount of all indebtedness secured by the Assets, plus the total Distributions paid to Stockholders from the Company s inception through the Termination Date, exceeds (ii) Invested Capital plus an amount equal to the Stockholders  6.0% Return from inception through the Termination Date. No deferral of payment of the Subordinated Performance Fee may be made under this paragraph of this   Section 3.01(c)  . In the event that the Advisor disagrees with the valuation of Shares pursuant to this   Section 3.01(c)   where the Shares are not Listed for purposes of determining the number of Shares to be issued to the Advisor following the Advisor s election to convert the balance of the Subordinated Performance Fee owed to the Advisor, then the fair market value of such Shares shall be determined by an Independent Expert of equity value selected by the Advisor. 
     
   10 

(d) 
    Disposition Fee  . If the Advisor or an Affiliate of the Advisor provides a substantial amount of the services (as determined by a majority of the Independent Directors) in connection with the Sale of one or more Properties (or the Company s entire portfolio), the Advisor or such Affiliate shall receive a Disposition Fee equal to up to one-half of the real estate or brokerage commission paid to the Company by Persons not affiliated with the Advisor on the Sale of the Property, not to exceed 1% of the Contract Sales Price of each Property sold; provided, however, in no event may the total Disposition Fee paid to the Advisor or an Affiliate of the Advisor, and any Persons not affiliated with the Advisor, exceed the lesser of (i) the Competitive Real Estate Commission or (ii) 6.0% of the Contract Sales Price of a Property. 
              (e) 
    Financing Coordination Fee  . For services provided by the Advisor in connection with any Financing to acquire Property, the Company shall pay the Advisor a Financing Coordination Fee in the amount of 1% of the amount available and/or outstanding under such Financing; provided, however, (i) the Advisor shall not be entitled to such fee on any refinanced indebtedness or obligation where the Advisor previously received such a fee on the original indebtedness or obligation unless (1) the maturity date of the original indebtedness or obligation is scheduled to occur less than one year after the date of the refinanced indebtedness or obligation and the refinanced indebtedness or obligation has a term of at least five years or (2) the refinanced indebtedness or obligation is approved by a majority of the Independent Directors, and (ii) no such fee will be paid in connection with any loans advanced by an Affiliate of the Advisor.

In addition, with respect to any revolving line of credit, the Advisor shall receive Financing Coordination Fees only in connection with amounts being drawn for the first time and not upon any re-drawing of amounts that previously had been repaid by the Company.

The General Partner shall not issue any additional REIT Shares (other than REIT Shares issued in connection with an exchange made pursuant to Section 8.5 or pursuant to the proviso in this Section 4.2(a)(iii)) or rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities containing the right to subscribe for or purchase REIT Shares (collectively,    Additional Securities   ) other than to all holders of REIT Shares, unless (A) the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to issue to the General Partner (or to the General Partner and the Original Limited Partner), as the General Partner may designate, Partnership Interests or rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities of the Partnership having designations, preferences and other rights such that the economic interests are substantially similar to those of the Additional Securities, and (B) the General Partner (or the General Partner and the Original Limited Partner) contributes the net proceeds from the issuance of such Additional Securities and from any exercise of rights contained in such Additional Securities, directly and through the General Partner              

15 

(or the General Partner and the Original Limited Partner), to the Partnership (without limiting the foregoing, for example, the Partnership shall issue Partnership Interests consisting of Partnership Class A Units to the General Partner in connection with the General Partner s issuance of REIT Class A Shares, Partnership Class T Units to the General Partner in connection with the General Partner s issuance of REIT Class T Shares, and a class of Partnership Units with such designations, preferences, relative participating, optional or other special rights, powers and duties, rights as to allocations of items of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction and credit, rights to share in Partnership distributions, and rights upon dissolution and liquidation as correspond to the General Partner s issuance of a new class of REIT Shares);   provided, however  , that the General Partner is allowed to issue Additional Securities in connection with an acquisition of a Property, Mortgage or other asset to be held directly by the General Partner or indirectly through a Subsidiary, other than through the Partnership. Without limiting the foregoing, the General Partner is expressly authorized to issue Additional Securities for less than fair market value, and (except as permitted by the preceding proviso) to cause the Partnership to issue to the General Partner (or to the General Partner and the Original Limited Partner) corresponding Partnership Interests, so long as (1) the General Partner concludes in good faith that such issuance is in the best interests of the General Partner and the Partnership, including without limitation, the issuance of REIT Shares and corresponding Partnership Units pursuant to an employee share purchase plan providing for employee purchases of REIT Shares at a discount from fair market value or employee stock options that have an exercise price that is less than the fair market value of the REIT Shares, either at the time of issuance or at the time of exercise, and (2) the General Partner contributes directly or indirectly and through the Original Limited Partner all proceeds from such issuance to the Partnership. For example, in the event the General Partner issues REIT Shares of any class for a cash purchase price and contributes all of the net proceeds of such issuance to the Partnership, the General Partner shall be issued a number of additional Partnership Units having the same class designation as the issued REIT Shares equal to the product of (x) the number of such REIT Shares of that class issued by the General Partner, the net proceeds of which were so contributed, multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is 100%, and the denominator of which is the Conversion Factor for that class of Partnership Units in effect on the date of such contribution. 
  (b)       Certain Deemed Contributions of Proceeds of Issuance of REIT Shares  .  
  Subject to the permitted use of cash specified in Section 8.5(d), in connection with any and all issuances of REIT Shares, the General Partner shall make directly or indirectly and through the Original Limited Partner Capital Contributions to the Partnership of the proceeds from such issuances, provided, that if the proceeds actually received and contributed by the General Partner are less than the gross proceeds of such issuance as a result of any underwriter s discount or other fees or expenses paid or incurred in connection with such issuance, then the General Partner (or the General Partner together with the Original Limited Partner, as applicable) shall be deemed to have made Capital Contributions to the Partnership in the aggregate amount of the gross proceeds of such 

16 

issuance and the Partnership shall be deemed simultaneously to have paid such offering expenses in accordance with Section 6.5 and in connection with the required issuance of additional Partnership Units for such Capital Contributions pursuant to Section 4.2(a), and any such expenses shall be allocable solely to the class of Partnership Units issued to the General Partner (or the Original Limited Partner) at such time. 
  (c)       Original Limited Partner Deemed Contributions  . In the event the Original Limited Partner elects to waive any distribution of cash hereunder to be made to it pursuant to Section 5.2(a), then such amount shall be deemed to be an additional contribution of capital to the Partnership by the Original Limited Partner, which shall be added to the Original Limited Partner s Capital Contribution to the Partnership and the Original Limited Partner s Capital Account as established and maintained under Section 4.4, and such Original Limited Partner will be issued Partnership Class A Units in an amount equal to the quotient of the amount of cash distribution foregone divided by the NAV per Partnership Class A Unit. 
  4.3.   Additional Funding  . If the General Partner determines that it is in the best interests of the Partnership to provide for additional Partnership funds (   Additional Funds   ) for any Partnership purpose, the General Partner may (a) cause the Partnership to obtain such funds from outside borrowings, or (b) elect to have the General Partner or any of its Affiliates provide such Additional Funds to the Partnership through loans or otherwise. 
  4.4.   Capital Accounts  . A separate capital account (a    Capital Account   ) shall be established and maintained for each Partner in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). If (a) a new or existing Partner acquires an additional Partnership Interest in exchange for more than a   de minimis   Capital Contribution, (b) the Partnership distributes to a Partner more than a   de minimis   amount of Partnership property as consideration for the redemption of a Partnership Interest, or (c) the Partnership is liquidated within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), the General Partner shall revalue the property of the Partnership to its fair market value (as determined by the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, and taking into account Section 7701(g) of the Code) in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(iv)(f). When the Partnership s property is revalued by the General Partner, the Capital Accounts of the Partners shall be adjusted in accordance with Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) and (g), which generally require such Capital Accounts to be adjusted to reflect the manner in which the unrealized gain or loss inherent in such property (that has not been reflected in the Capital Accounts previously) would be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 5.1 if there were a taxable disposition of such property for its fair market value (as determined by the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, and taking into account Section 7701(g) of the Code) on the date of the revaluation. 
  4.5.   Percentage Interests  . If the number of outstanding Partnership Units increases or decreases during a taxable year, each Partner s Class Percentage Interest and Partnership Percentage Interest shall be adjusted by the General Partner effective as of the date of each such increase or decrease to a percentage equal to the number of Partnership Units of a class or series held by such Partner divided by the aggregate number of Partnership Units of such class or series outstanding after giving effect to such increase or decrease. If the Partners  Percentage Interests are adjusted pursuant to this Section 4.5, the Profit and Loss for the taxable year in which the 

17 

adjustment occurs shall be prorated between the part of the year ending on the day when the Partnership s property is revalued by the General Partner and the part of the year beginning on the following day and, as so divided, shall be allocated to the Partners based on their Percentage Interests before adjustment, and their adjusted Percentage Interests, respectively, either (a) as if the taxable year had ended on the date of the adjustment or (b) based on the number of days in each part. The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall determine which method shall be used to allocate Profit and Loss for the taxable year in which an adjustment occurs, as may be required or permitted under Section 706 of the Code. 
  4.6.   No Interest on Contributions  . No Partner shall be entitled to interest on its Capital Contribution. 
  4.7.   Return of Capital Contributions  . No Partner shall be entitled to withdraw any part of its Capital Contribution or its Capital Account or to receive any distribution from the Partnership, except as specifically provided in this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein, there shall be no obligation to return to any Partner or withdrawn Partner any part of such Partner s Capital Contribution for so long as the Partnership continues in existence. 
  4.8.   No Third-Party Beneficiary  . No creditor or other third party having dealings with the Partnership shall have the right to enforce the right or obligation of any Partner to make Capital Contributions or loans or to pursue any other right or remedy hereunder or at law or in equity, it being understood and agreed that the provisions of this Agreement shall be solely for the benefit of, and may be enforced solely by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. None of the rights or obligations of the Partners herein set forth to make Capital Contributions or loans to the Partnership shall be deemed an asset of the Partnership for any purpose by any creditor or other third party, nor may such rights or obligations be sold, transferred or assigned by the Partnership or pledged or encumbered by the Partnership to secure any debt or other obligation of the Partnership or of any of the Partners. In addition, it is the intent of the parties hereto that no distribution to any Limited Partner shall be deemed a return of money or other property in violation of the Act. However, if any court of competent jurisdiction holds that, notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, any Limited Partner is obligated to return such money or property, such obligation shall be the obligation of such Limited Partner and not of the General Partner. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a deficit Capital Account of a Partner shall not be deemed to be a liability of such Partner nor an asset or property of the Partnership. 
  Article V. 
  Profit and Loss; Distributions 
  5.1.   Allocation of Profit and Loss  . 
  (a)       General  . Subject to Section 4.4 and any rights provided for with respect to a class or of Partnership Units not specifically contemplated herein, and after giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Sections 5.1(c), 5.1(d), and 5.1(e), Profits and Losses will be allocated among the Partners in each taxable year (or portion thereof) as provided below. 

18 

(i)       Profit  . Profit shall be allocated as follows: 
  (1)     first to the Partners, pro rata, in amounts equal to the amount of cash distributed to the Partners pursuant to Section 5.2(a) with respect to such fiscal year;    (2)     second, to the extent the amount of Profit for such fiscal year exceeds the amount of cash distributed to the Partners pursuant to Section 5.2(a), such excess shall be allocated: 
  (A)     to the General Partner (on account of its General Partnership Interest) in an amount equal to the cumulative Loss allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.1(a)(ii)(3); and then 
  (B)     to the Limited Partners (including the General Partner in its capacity as a Limited Partner) in amounts and in proportion to the cumulative Loss allocated to the Partners pursuant to Section 5.1(a)(ii)(2); and 
  (3)     finally, the balance, if any, of Profit shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with and in proportion to their respective Partnership Percentage Interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, it is the intent of the Partners that allocations of Profit to the Limited Partners be such that the amount of Profit allocated to each Limited Partner be equal to the amount of income that would have been allocated to such Limited Partner with respect to the applicable fiscal period if such Limited Partner had owned REIT Shares equal in number to the number of Partnership Units owned by such Limited Partner during such fiscal period, and if, for any reason, the foregoing allocations of Profit result in any material variation from this concept, Profit shall be allocated to each Limited Partner in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of income that would have been allocated to such Limited Partner with respect to the applicable fiscal period if such Limited Partner had owned a number of REIT Shares equal to the product of the number of Partnership Units owned by such Limited Partner during such fiscal period multiplied by the Conversion Factor in effect. 
  (ii)       Loss  . Loss shall be allocated as follows: 
  (1)     first, to the Partners, pro rata, in accordance with and in proportion to their respective Partnership Interests, until the cumulative Loss allocated to each Partner under this Section 5.1(a)(ii)(1) equals the cumulative Profit allocated to each Partner under Section 5.1(a)(i)(3); 
  (2)     second to the Partners pro rata in an amount equal to each Partner s Capital Account balance prior to the allocation made under this Section 5.1(a)(ii)(2); and 

19 

(3)     third, to the General Partner on account of its General Partnership Interest to the extent that any further allocation of Loss to Limited Partners would result in any such Limited Partners having a deficit balance in their Capital Accounts. 
    
  (b)       Special Allocation of Expense of Distribution and Stockholder Servicing Fee and Other Class Specific Items  . If the Partnership directly or on behalf of the General Partner incurs any Distribution and Stockholder Servicing Fee, such amounts shall be specially allocated among the Partnership Class T Units to correspond with their appropriate share of such expenses. To the extent that any other items of income, gain, loss or deduction of the General Partner are allocable to a specific class or series of REIT Shares as provided in the General Partner s Prospectus, such items, or an amount equal thereto, shall be specially allocated to the class or series of Partnership Units corresponding to such class or series of REIT Shares. 
  (c)       Minimum Gain Chargeback  . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, (i) any expense of the Partnership that is a  nonrecourse deduction  within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-2(b)(1) shall be allocated in accordance with the Partners  respective Partnership Percentage Interests, (ii) any expense of the Partnership that is a  partner nonrecourse deduction  within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(2) shall be allocated to the Partner that bears the  economic risk of loss  of such deduction in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(1), (iii) if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-2(f)(1) for any Partnership taxable year, then, subject to the exceptions set forth in Regulations Section 1.704-2(f)(2), (3), (4) and (5), items of gain and income shall be allocated among the Partners in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and the ordering rules contained in Regulations Section 1.704-2(j), and (iv) if there is a net decrease in Partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) for any Partnership taxable year, then, subject to the exceptions set forth in Regulations Section 1.704-2(g), items of gain and income shall be allocated among the Partners, in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and the ordering rules contained in Regulations Section 1.704-2(j). A Partner s  interest in partnership profits  for purposes of determining its share of the nonrecourse liabilities of the Partnership within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3) shall be such Partner s Partnership Percentage Interest. 
  (d)       Qualified Income Offset  . If a Partner receives in any taxable year an adjustment, allocation, or distribution described in subparagraphs (4), (5), or (6) of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) that causes or increases a deficit balance in such Partner s Capital Account that exceeds the sum of such Partner s shares of Partnership Minimum Gain and Partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain, as determined in accordance with Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i), such Partner shall be allocated specially for such taxable year (and, if necessary, later taxable years) items of income and gain in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate such deficit Capital Account balance as quickly as possible as provided in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d); provided, that an allocation pursuant to this Section 5.1(d) shall be made only if such Partner would have a deficit Capital Account balance after all other     

20 

allocations provided for in Article V have been tentatively made as if this Section 5.1(d) were not in this Agreement. This Section 5.1(d) is intended to constitute a  qualified income offset  under Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. After the occurrence of an allocation of income or gain to a Partner in accordance with this Section 5.1(d), to the extent permitted by Regulations Section 1.704-1(b), items of expense or loss shall be allocated to such Partner in an amount necessary to offset the income or gain previously allocated to such Partner under this Section 5.1(d). 
  (e)       Limitation on Loss Allocations  . Loss shall not be allocated to a Limited Partner to the extent that such allocation would cause a deficit in such Partner s Capital Account (after reduction to reflect the items described in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) and (6)) to exceed the sum of such Partner s shares of Partnership Minimum Gain and Partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain. Any Loss in excess of that limitation shall be allocated to the General Partner. After the occurrence of an allocation of Loss to the General Partner in accordance with this Section 5.1(e), to the extent permitted by Regulations Section 1.704-1(b), Profit shall be allocated to the General Partner in an amount necessary to offset the Loss previously allocated to the General Partner under this Section 5.1(e). 
  (f)       Allocations Between Transferor and Transferee  . If a Partner transfers any part or all of its Partnership Interest, the distributive shares of the various items of Profit and Loss allocable among the Partners during such fiscal year of the Partnership shall be allocated between the transferor and the transferee Partner either (i) as if the Partnership s fiscal year had ended on the date of the transfer, or (ii) based on the number of days of such fiscal year that each was a Partner without regard to the results of Partnership activities in the respective portions of such fiscal year in which the transferor and the transferee were Partners. The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall determine which method shall be used to allocate the distributive shares of the various items of Profit and Loss between the transferor and the transferee Partner. 
  (g)       Definition of Profit and Loss  . 
  (i)        Profit    and    Loss    and any items of income, gain, expense, or loss referred to in this Agreement shall be determined in accordance with federal income tax accounting principles, as modified by Regulations Section 1.704-(b)(2)(iv), except that Profit and Loss shall not include items of income, gain and expense that are specially allocated pursuant to Sections 5.1(b), 5.1(c), 5.1(d), or 5.1(e). 
  (ii)     All allocations of income, Profit, gain, Loss, and expense (and all items contained therein) for federal income tax purposes shall be identical to all allocations of such items set forth in this Section 5.1, except as otherwise required by Section 704(c) of the Code and Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4). The General Partner shall have the authority, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the need for consent from any Partner, to elect the method or methods to be used by the Partnership for allocating items of income, gain, expense and 

21 

deductions as required by Section 704(c) of the Code, including election of a method that may result in one or more Partners receiving or being allocated a disproportionately larger share of items of Partnership income, gain, expense or deduction, and any such election shall be binding on all Partners. 
  5.2.   Distributions of Cash  . 
     (a)     Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5.2 and to the terms of any Partnership Unit Designation, the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to distribute cash on a quarterly (or, at the election of the General Partner, more frequent) basis, in an amount determined by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion, to the Partners who are Partners on the Partnership Record Date with respect to such quarter (or other distribution period) in the following manner: 
  (i)     first, with respect to any Partnership Interests that are entitled to any   preference in   distribution, in accordance with the rights of such class(es) or series of Partnership Interests (and, within such class(es) or series,   pro rata   in proportion to the respective Class Percentage Interests on such Partnership Record Date); and 
  (ii)     second, with respect to any Partnership Interest that are not entitled to any preference in distribution, in accordance with the rights of such class or series of Partnership Interests (and, within such class or series,   pro rata   in proportion to the respective Class Percentage Interests on such Partnership Record Date). 
  If a new or existing Partner acquires an additional Partnership Interest in exchange for a Capital Contribution on any date other than a Partnership Record Date, the cash distribution attributable to such additional Partnership Interest relating to the Partnership Record Date next following the issuance of such additional Partnership Interest shall be reduced to the proportion thereof which equals the quotient of (a) the number of days that such additional Partnership Interest is held by such Partner during such period divided by (b) the number of days between such Partnership Record Date and the immediately preceding Partnership Record Date. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the Original Limited Partner may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to defer any distribution to be made to it, in which case the amount so deferred shall be deemed to be an additional Capital Contribution made on behalf of the Original Limited Partner under Section 4.2(c), to be distributed to the Original Limited Partner upon liquidation of the Partnership under Section 5.6, or at such time as the Original Limited Partner withdraws from the Partnership. 
  (b)     To the extent amounts distributed to the General Partner are attributable to amounts received from a Property in which the General Partner or a Subsidiary of the General Partner holds a direct or indirect interest (other than through the Partnership) (an    Outside Interest   ), (i) amounts distributed to the General Partner under this Agreement will be reduced so as to take into account amounts received pursuant to the Outside 

22 

Interest, and (ii) the amounts distributed to the Limited Partners will be increased by the same amount, so that the overall effect of the distribution is to distribute what would have been distributed under Section 5.2(a) had such Outside Interest been held through the Partnership (treating any distribution made in respect of the Outside Interest as if such distribution had been received by the General Partner). 
  (c)     To the extent the payment of the Distribution and Stockholder Servicing Fee reduces cash otherwise available for distribution, such cash available for distribution shall be deemed increased by the amount of Distribution and Stockholder Servicing Fee for purposes of Section 5.2(a), but the amount equal to the Distribution and Stockholder Servicing Fee paid will reduce the distributions with respect to the Partnership Class T Units associated with the REIT Class T Shares intended to bear the cost of the Distribution and Stockholder Servicing Fee. For example, assume the Partnership has $9,920,000 available to distribute under Section 5.2(a), has 2,000,000 Partnership Class T Units and 2,000,000 Partnership Class A Units outstanding, and had paid, on behalf of the General Partner, $80,000 on account of the Distribution and Stockholder Servicing Fee associated with REIT Class T Shares. Cash available for purposes of applying Section 5.2(a) will be deemed to be $10,000,000 ($9,920,000 + $80,000), which will initially get apportioned in accordance with the Partnership Percentage Interests, or $5,000,000 to the Partnership Class T Units (2,000,000 Partnership Class T Units / 4,000,000 total Partnership Units) and $5,000,000 to the Partnership Class A Units (2,000,000 Partnership Class A Units / 4,000,000 total Partnership Units). Thereafter, $4,920,000 ($5,000,000 less the $80,000 for the Distribution and Stockholder Servicing Fee) would be distributed on account of the Partnership Class T Units (or $2.46 per Partnership Class T Unit). And $5,000,000 would be distributed on account of the Partnership Class A Units (or $2.50 per Partnership Class A Unit). Similar adjustments to cash available for distribution, and a concomitant increase or decrease in distributions with respect to Partnership Interests, shall be made for any other items of income, gain, loss or deduction of the General Partner that are allocable to a specific class or series Partnership Units in the manner contemplated by Section 5.1(b). 
  (d)     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner is authorized to take any action that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to cause the Partnership to comply with any withholding requirements established under the Code or any other federal, state or local law including, without limitation, the requirements of Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of the Code. To the extent that the Partnership is required to withhold and pay over to any taxing authority any amount resulting from the allocation or distribution of income to a Partner or its assignee (including by reason of Section 1446 of the Code), either (i) if the actual amount to be distributed to the Partner or assignee equals or exceeds the amount required to be withheld by the Partnership, the amount withheld shall be treated as a distribution of cash in the amount of such withholding to such Partner or assignee, or (ii) if the actual amount to be distributed to the Partner or assignee is less than the amount required to be withheld by the Partnership, the amount required to be withheld shall be treated as a loan (a    Partnership Loan   ) from the Partnership to the Partner or assignee on the day the Partnership pays over such amount to a taxing authority. A Partnership Loan shall be payable on demand and may, at the discretion of the General Partner, be repaid through 

23 

withholding by the Partnership with respect to subsequent distributions to the applicable Partner or assignee. In the event that a Limited Partner (a    Defaulting Limited Partner   ) fails to pay any amount owed to the Partnership with respect to the Partnership Loan within 15 days after demand for payment thereof is made by the Partnership on the Limited Partner, the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, may elect to make the payment to the Partnership on behalf of such Defaulting Limited Partner. In such event, on the date of payment, the General Partner shall be deemed to have extended a loan (a    General Partner Loan   ) to the Defaulting Limited Partner in the amount of the payment made by the General Partner and shall succeed to all rights and remedies of the Partnership against the Defaulting Limited Partner as to that amount. Without limitation, the General Partner shall have the right to receive any distributions that otherwise would be made by the Partnership to the Defaulting Limited Partner until such time as the General Partner Loan has been paid in full, and any such distributions so received by the General Partner shall be treated as having been received by the Defaulting Limited Partner and immediately paid to the General Partner. Any amounts treated as a Partnership Loan or a General Partner Loan pursuant to this Section 5.2(d) shall bear interest at the lesser of (A) the base rate on corporate loans at large United States money center commercial banks, as published from time to time in The Wall Street Journal, or (B) the maximum lawful rate of interest on such obligation, such interest to accrue from the date the Partnership or the General Partner, as applicable, is deemed to extend the loan until such loan is repaid in full. 
  (e)     To the extent not utilized for expenses of the Partnership or for investment in additional Properties, the General Partner may, in its discretion, cause the Partnership to distribute Net Capital Proceeds in such amount as shall be determined by the General Partner in its discretion in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.2(a). 
  (f)     In no event may a Partner receive a distribution of cash with respect to a Partnership Unit if such Partner is entitled to receive a cash dividend as the holder of record of a REIT Share for which all or part of such Partnership Unit has been or will be exchanged. 
  5.3.   REIT Distribution Requirements  . The General Partner shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the Partnership to distribute amounts sufficient to enable the General Partner to pay stockholder dividends that will allow the General Partner to (a) meet its distribution requirement for qualification as a REIT as set forth in Section 857 of the Code and (b) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability imposed by the Code. 
  5.4.   No Right to Distributions in Kind  . No Partner shall be entitled to demand property other than cash in connection with any distributions by the Partnership. 
  5.5.   Limitations on Return of Capital Contributions  . Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Article V, no Partner shall have the right to receive and the General Partner shall not have the right to make a distribution that includes a return of all or part of a Partner s Capital Contributions, unless after giving effect to the return of a Capital Contribution, the sum of all Partnership liabilities, other than the liabilities to a Partner for the return of its Capital Contribution, does not exceed the fair market value of the Partnership s assets. 

24 

5.6.   Distributions Upon Liquidation  . Upon liquidation of the Partnership, after payment of, or adequate provision for, debts and obligations of the Partnership, including any Partner loans, any remaining assets of the Partnership shall be distributed to all Partners with positive Capital Accounts in accordance with their respective positive Capital Account balances. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Capital Account of each Partner shall be determined after all adjustments made in accordance with Sections 5.1 and 5.2 resulting from Partnership operations and from all sales and dispositions of all or any part of the Partnership s assets have been made. To the extent deemed advisable by the General Partner, appropriate arrangements (including the use of a liquidating trust) may be made to assure that adequate funds are available to pay any contingent debts or obligations. 
  5.7.   Substantial Economic Effect  . It is the intent of the Partners that the allocations of Profit and Loss under this Agreement have substantial economic effect (or be consistent with the Partners  interests in the Partnership in the case of the allocation of losses attributable to nonrecourse debt) within the meaning of Section 704(b) of the Code as interpreted by the Regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. Article V and other relevant provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent. If, for any reason, the General Partner deems it necessary in order to comply with the Code, the General Partner may, and is hereby authorized and directed to, allocate income, gain, loss, deduction or credit (or items thereof) arising in any year differently than as provided for in this Article V if, and to the extent, (i) that allocating income, gain, loss, deduction or credit (or item thereof) would cause the determinations and allocations of each Partner s distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit (or item thereof) not to be permitted by the Code and any Regulations promulgated thereunder, or (ii) such allocation would be inconsistent with a Partner s interest in the Partnership taking into consideration all facts and circumstances. Any allocation made pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall be deemed to be a complete substitute for any allocation otherwise provided for in this Agreement, and no further amendment of this Agreement or approval by any Partner shall be required to effectuate such allocation. In making any such allocations (   New Allocations   ) under this Section, the General Partner is authorized to act in reliance upon advice of counsel to the Partnership or the Partnership s regular certified public accountants that, in their opinion, after examining the relevant provisions of the Code and any current or future proposed or final Regulations thereunder, the New Allocations are necessary in order to ensure that, in either the then-current year or in any preceding year, each Partner s distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit (or items thereof) are determined and allocated in accordance with the Code and the Partner s interests in the Partnership. New Allocations made by the General Partner in reliance upon the advice of counsel and accountants as described above shall be deemed to be made in the best interests of the Partnership and all of the Partners consistent with the duties of the General Partner hereunder and any such New Allocations shall not give rise to any claim or cause of action by any Partner against the Partnership or the General Partner. 

25 

Article VI. 
  Rights, Obligations and Powers of the General Partner 
  6.1.   Management of the Partnership  . 
  (a)     Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the General Partner shall have full, complete and exclusive discretion to manage and control the business of the Partnership for the purposes herein stated, and shall make all decisions affecting the business and assets of the Partnership. Subject to the restrictions specifically contained in this Agreement, the powers and obligations, as the context requires, of the General Partner shall include, without limitation, the authority to take the following actions on behalf of the Partnership:

  (viii)     to lease all or any portion of any of the Partnership s assets, whether or not the terms of such leases extend beyond the termination date of the Partnership and whether or not any portion of the Partnership s assets so leased are to be occupied by the lessee, or, in turn, subleased in whole or in part to others, for such consideration and on such terms as the General Partner may determine;

  (xx)     to establish Partnership reserves for working capital, capital expenditures, contingent liabilities, or any other valid Partnership purpose; 
  (xxi)     to merge, consolidate or combine the Partnership with or into another Person, subject to the provisions of Article XII;

  (b)     Except as otherwise provided herein, to the extent the duties of the General Partner require expenditures of funds to be paid to third parties, the General Partner shall not have any obligations hereunder except to apply Partnership funds to the extent that Partnership funds are reasonably available to it for the performance of such duties, and nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize or require the General Partner, in its capacity as such, to expend its own funds for payment to third parties or to undertake any liability or obligation directly on its account for or on behalf of the Partnership. 
  (c)     Any actions taken by the General Partner pursuant to its authority under this Agreement on behalf of the Partnership regarding the approval of any transaction between the Partnership and the Sponsor, Advisor, a member of the board of directors of CCIT III, or any Affiliate of the foregoing, shall require a finding by a majority of the 

28 

members of the board of directors of CCIT III that such actions are fair and reasonable to CCIT III and the Partnership on terms and conditions not less favorable to CCIT III or the Partnership, as applicable, than those available from unaffiliated third parties. 
    
  6.2.   Delegation of Authority  . The General Partner may delegate any or all of its powers, rights and obligations hereunder, and may appoint, employ, contract or otherwise deal with any Person (including without limitation officers or other agents of the Partnership or the General Partner appointed by the General Partner) for the transaction of the business of the Partnership, which Person may, under supervision of the General Partner, perform any acts or services for the Partnership as the General Partner may approve. 
  6.3.   Indemnification of Indemnitees  . 
    (a)     The Partnership shall indemnify an Indemnitee from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Partnership as set forth in this Agreement in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, as a result of acting on behalf of or performing services for the Partnership, only if it is determined that (i) the Indemnitee acted in good faith and (ii) that the Indemnitee reasonably believed that the act or omission was in the Partnership s best interests, or if the act or omission was outside the Indemnitee s official capacity acting on behalf of the Partnership, that the act or omission was at least not opposed to the Partnership s best interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Indemnitee shall be liable, responsible and accountable, and the Partnership shall not be liable to an Indemnitee (other than for reasonable expenses advanced pursuant to Section 6.3(c) below), with respect to a proceeding in which (i) the Indemnitee is found liable on the basis that the Indemnitee improperly received personal benefit, whether or not the benefit resulted from an action taken in the Indemnitee s official capacity, or (ii) the Indemnitee is found liable to the Partnership or the Limited Partners. The Partnership shall not indemnify or hold harmless the Indemnitee if the loss or liability was the result of the Indemnitee s gross negligence or willful misconduct (in the case of an Indemnitee who was an Independent Director (as defined in the Articles of Incorporation)) or was the result of the Indemnitee s negligence or misconduct (in the case of all other Indemnitees). The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order or settlement does not create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of conduct set forth in this Section 6.3(a). The termination of any proceeding by conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, or an entry of an order of probation prior to judgment, does not alone determine that the Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified in this Section 6.3(a). Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership. 
    (b)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the provisions of Section 6.3(a), the Partnership shall not provide indemnification for any loss, liability or expense arising from or out of an alleged violation of federal or state securities laws by an Indemnitee unless one or more of the following conditions are met: (i) there has been a 

29 

successful adjudication on the merits of each count involving alleged securities law violations as to the particular Indemnitee, (ii) such claims have been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction as to the particular Indemnitee, or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims against a particular Indemnitee and finds that indemnification of the settlement and the related costs should be made, and the court considering the request for indemnification has been advised of the position of the SEC and of the published position of any state securities regulatory authority in which securities of the Partnership were offered or sold as to indemnification for violations of securities laws. 
  (c)     The Partnership shall pay or reimburse reasonable legal expenses and other costs incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of final disposition of a proceeding if all of the following are satisfied: (i) the proceeding relates to acts or omissions with respect to the performance of duties for services on behalf of the Partnership, (ii) the Indemnitee provides the Partnership with written affirmation of the Indemnitee s good faith belief that the Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Partnership as authorized in this Section 6.3, (iii) the legal proceeding was initiated by a third party who is not a stockholder of the General Partner or Limited Partner, or if by a stockholder of the General Partner or Limited Partner acting in his or her capacity as such, a court of competent jurisdiction approves such advancement, and (iv) the Indemnitee provides the Partnership with a written agreement to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the Partnership, together with the applicable legal rate of interest thereon, if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnitee did not comply with the requisite standard of conduct and is not entitled to indemnification. 
   (d)     The Indemnification provided by this Section 6.3 shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as a matter of law or otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity. 
   (e)     The Partnership may purchase and maintain insurance or establish other arrangements, including without limitation trust arrangements and letters of credit on behalf of or to secure indemnification obligations owed to the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the General Partner shall determine against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses that may be incurred by such Person in connection with the Partnership s activities, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement. 
    (f)     For purposes of this Section 6.3, (i) the Partnership shall be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan whenever the performance by the Indemnitee of its duties to the Partnership also imposes duties on the Indemnitee, or otherwise involves services by the Indemnitee to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; (ii) excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute fines within the meaning of this Section 6.3; and (iii) actions taken or omitted by the Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries 

30 

of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose which is not opposed to the best interests of the Partnership. 
     
  (g)     In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement. 
    (h)     An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Section 6.3 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 
    (i)     The provisions of this Section 6.3 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights in or be for the benefit of any other Persons. 
    (j)     Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Section 6.3, nor the adoption or amendment of any other provision of this Agreement inconsistent with this Section 6.3, shall apply to or affect in any respect the applicability of this Section 6.3 with respect to any act or failure to act that occurred prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption. 
    (k)     Notwithstanding the preceding, the indemnification provided under this Section 6.3 shall be limited to the extent it would provide greater indemnification than would be allowed under Article XII of the Articles of Incorporation. 
  6.4.   Liability of the General Partner  . 
  (a)   Generally  . 
  (i)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the General Partner shall not be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership or any Partners for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of errors in judgment or any act or omission if the General Partner acted in good faith. The General Partner shall not be in breach of any duty that the General Partner may owe to the Limited Partners or the Partnership or any other Persons under this Agreement or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity, provided the General Partner, acting in good faith, abides by the terms of this Agreement. 
  (ii)     In addition, to the extent the General Partner or any officer, director, employee, agent or stockholder of the General Partner performs its duties in accordance with the standards provided by the Act, such Person or Persons shall have no liability by reason of being or having been the General Partner, or by reason of being an officer, director, employee, agent or stockholder of the General Partner. To the maximum extent that the Act and the general laws of the State of Delaware, in effect from time to time, permit limitation of the liability of general partners of a limited partnership, the General Partner and its officers, directors, employees, agents and stockholders shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for money damages   except   to the extent that (1) the General Partner or its officers, directors, employees, agents or stockholders actually received an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services, in which case the liability shall not exceed the amount of the benefit or profit in money, property or services actually 

31 

received; or (2) a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the General Partner or one or more of its officers, directors, employees, agents or stockholders is entered in a proceeding based on a finding in the proceeding that the action or failure to act of the General Partner or one or more of its officers, directors, employees, agents or stockholders was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and was material to the cause of action adjudicated in the proceeding. 
  (iii)     Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Section 6.4(a), nor the adoption or amendment of any other provision of this Agreement inconsistent with this Section 6.4(a), shall apply to or affect in any respect the applicability of the preceding sentence with respect to any act or failure to act which occurred prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption. 
  (b)     The Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that the General Partner is acting on behalf of the Partnership, itself and its stockholders collectively, that the General Partner is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the Limited Partners (including, without limitation, the tax consequences to Limited Partners or the tax consequences of some, but not all, of the Limited Partners) in deciding whether to cause the Partnership to take (or decline to take) any actions. In the event of a conflict between the interests of its stockholders on the one hand and the Limited Partners on the other, the General Partner shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the conflict in a manner not adverse to either its stockholders or the Limited Partners; provided, however, that for so long as the General Partner directly owns a controlling interest in the Partnership, any such conflict that the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines cannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either its stockholders or the Limited Partners shall be resolved in favor of its stockholders. The General Partner shall not be liable for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred, or benefits not derived by Limited Partners in connection with such decisions, provided that the General Partner has acted in good faith. 
  (c)     Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in Section 6.1, the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to it under this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its agents. The General Partner shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent appointed by it in good faith. 
  (d)     Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or the Act, any action of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or any decision of the General Partner to refrain from acting on behalf of the Partnership, undertaken in the good faith belief that such action or omission is necessary or advisable in order to (i) protect the ability of the General Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT or (ii) prevent the General Partner from incurring any taxes under Section 857, Section 4981, or any other provision of the Code, is expressly authorized under this Agreement and is deemed approved by all of the Limited Partners. 

32 

(e)     Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.4 or any provision shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on the General Partner s liability to the Partnership and the Limited Partners under this Section 6.4 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when claims relating to such matters may arise or be asserted. 
  6.5.   Reimbursement of General Partner  . 
  (a)     Except as provided in this Section 6.5 and elsewhere in this Agreement (including the provisions of Article V regarding distributions, payments, and allocations to which it may be entitled), the General Partner shall not be compensated for its services as general partner of the Partnership. 
  (b)     The Partnership shall be responsible for and shall pay all expenses relating to the Partnership s ownership of its assets and its operations. The General Partner shall be reimbursed on a monthly basis, or such other basis as the General Partner may determine in its sole and absolute discretion, for all Administrative Expenses. The Partners acknowledge that all such expenses of the General Partner are deemed to be for the benefit of the Partnership. Such reimbursement shall be in addition to any reimbursement made as a result of indemnification pursuant to Section 6.3 hereof. In the event that certain expenses are incurred for the benefit of the Partnership and other entities, such expenses will be allocated to the Partnership and such other entities in such a manner as the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion deems fair and reasonable. All payments and reimbursements hereunder shall be characterized for federal income tax purposes as expenses of the Partnership incurred on its behalf, and not as expenses of the General Partner. 
  6.6.   Outside Activities  . Subject to the Articles of Incorporation and any agreements entered into by the General Partner or its Affiliates with the Partnership or a Subsidiary, or any officer, director, employee, agent, trustee, Affiliate or stockholder of the General Partner, the General Partner shall be entitled to and may have business interests and engage in business activities in addition to those relating to the Partnership, including business interests and activities substantially similar or identical to those of the Partnership. Neither the Partnership nor any of the Limited Partners shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement in any such business ventures, interests or activities. None of the Limited Partners or any other Person shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement or the partnership relationship established hereby in any such business ventures, interests or activities, and the General Partner shall have no obligation pursuant to this Agreement to offer any interest in any such business ventures, interests and activities to the Partnership or any Limited Partner, even if such opportunity is of a character which. if presented to the Partnership or any Limited Partner, could be taken by such Person. 
  6.7.   Employment or Retention of Affiliates  . 
     (a)     Any Affiliate of the General Partner may be employed or retained by the Partnership and may otherwise deal with the Partnership (whether as an advisor, buyer, 

33 

lessor, lessee, manager, property management agent, asset manager, furnisher of goods or services, broker, agent, lender or otherwise) and may receive from the Partnership any compensation, price, or other payment therefor which the General Partner determines to be fair and reasonable. 
    
  (b)     The Partnership may lend or contribute to its Subsidiaries or other Persons in which it has an equity investment, and such Persons may borrow funds from the Partnership, on terms and conditions established in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner. The foregoing authority shall not create any right or benefit in favor of any Subsidiary or any other Person. 
  (c)     The Partnership may transfer assets to Joint Ventures, limited liability companies, other partnerships, corporations or other business entities in which it is or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and subject to such conditions as the General Partner deems to be consistent with this Agreement and applicable law. 
  (d)     Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, neither the General Partner nor any of its Affiliates shall sell, transfer or convey any property to, or purchase any property from, the Partnership, directly or indirectly, except pursuant to transactions that are on terms that are fair and reasonable to the Partnership. 
  6.8.   Title to Partnership Assets  . Partnership assets, whether real, personal or mixed and whether tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to be owned by the Partnership as an entity, and no Partner, individually or collectively, shall have any ownership interest in such Partnership assets or any portion thereof; provided, that title to any or all of the Partnership assets may be held in the name of the Partnership, the General Partner or one or more nominees, as the General Partner may determine, including Affiliates of the General Partner. The General Partner hereby declares and warrants that any Partnership assets for which legal title is held in the name of the General Partner or any nominee or Affiliate of the General Partner shall be held by such Person for the use and benefit of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided, that the General Partner shall use its best efforts to cause legal title to such assets to be vested in the Partnership as soon as reasonably practicable. All Partnership assets shall be recorded as the property of the Partnership in its books and records, irrespective of the name in which legal title to such Partnership assets is held. 
  6.9.   Miscellaneous  . In the event the General Partner redeems any REIT Shares, then the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to purchase from the General Partner or the Original Limited Partner a number of Partnership Units (of a class corresponding to the class of REIT Shares redeemed) determined by, and based upon, the application of the applicable Conversion Factor on the same terms upon which the General Partner redeemed such REIT Shares. Moreover, if the General Partner makes a cash tender offer or other offer to acquire REIT Shares, then the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to make a corresponding offer to the General Partner or the Original Limited Partner to acquire an equal number of Partnership Units (of a class corresponding to the class of REIT Shares solicited) held by the General Partner. In the event any REIT Shares are redeemed by the General Partner pursuant to such offer, the Partnership shall redeem an equivalent number of the General Partner s or the Original Limited Partner s Partnership Units (of a class corresponding to the class of REIT Shares  

34 

redeemed) for an equivalent purchase price based on the application of the applicable Conversion Factor. 
    
  6.10.   Reliance by Third Parties  . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the General Partner has full power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all assets of the Partnership and to enter into any contracts on behalf of the Partnership, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with the General Partner as if it were the Partnership s sole party in interest, both legally and beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby waives any and all defenses or other remedies which may be available against such Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the General Partner in connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any Person dealing with the General Partner or its representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of this Agreement have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or expedience of any act or action of the General Partner or its representatives. Each and every certificate, document, or other instrument executed on behalf of the Partnership by the General Partner or its representatives shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (i) at the time of the execution and delivery of such certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was in full force and effect, (ii) the Person executing and delivering such certificate, document or instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of the Partnership, and (iii) such certificate, document or instrument was duly executed and delivered in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and is binding upon the Partnership. 
                           
  Article VII. 
  Changes in General Partner 
  7.1.   Transfer of the General Partner s Partnership Interest  . 
  (a)     The General Partner shall not transfer all or any portion of its General Partnership Interest or withdraw as General Partner except as provided in or in connection with a transaction contemplated by Sections 7.1(c), 7.1(d), or 7.1(e). 
  (b)     The General Partner agrees that the Partnership Units that equate to a 0.1% Partnership Percentage Interest are designated as Partnership Units representing a General Partnership Interest. 
  (c)     Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.1(d) or 7.1(e), the General Partner shall not engage in any merger, consolidation or other combination with or into another Person or sale of all or substantially all of its assets (other than in connection with a change in the General Partner s state of incorporation or organizational form), which, in any such case, results in a change of control of the General Partner (a    Transaction   ), unless: 
  (i)     the consent of Partners holding more than 50% of the Partnership Percentage Interests is obtained; or 
  (ii)     as a result of such Transaction, all Partners are granted the right to receive for each Partnership Unit an amount of cash, securities, or other property 

35 

equal to the product of the Conversion Factor applicable to each Partnership Unit and the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property paid in the Transaction to a holder of one REIT Share (of a class corresponding to the Partnership Unit held by each Limited Partner) in consideration of the transfer of one such REIT Share; provided, that if, in connection with the Transaction, a purchase, tender, or exchange offer (   Offer   ) shall have been made to and accepted by the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding REIT Shares voting together as a single class, each holder of Partnership Units shall be given the option to exchange its Partnership Units for the greatest amount of cash, securities, or other property which a Limited Partner would have received had it (A) exercised its Exchange Right and (B) sold, tendered, or exchanged pursuant to the Offer the REIT Shares received upon exercise of the Exchange Right immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer; or 
  (iii)     the General Partner is the surviving entity in the Transaction and either (A) the holders of REIT Shares do not receive cash, securities, or other property in the Transaction or (B) all Limited Partners (other than the General Partner or any Subsidiary) receive an amount of cash, securities, or other property (expressed as an amount per REIT Share) that is no less than the product of the applicable Conversion Factor and the greatest amount of cash, securities, or other property (expressed as an amount per REIT Share) received in the Transaction by any holder of REIT Shares corresponding to the class of Partnership Units. 
  (d)     Notwithstanding Section 7.1(c), the General Partner may merge with or into or consolidate with another entity if immediately after such merger or consolidation (i) substantially all of the assets of the successor or surviving entity (the    Survivor   ), other than Partnership Units held by the General Partner, are contributed, directly or indirectly, to the Partnership as a Capital Contribution in exchange for Partnership Units with a fair market value equal to the value of the assets so contributed as determined by the Survivor in good faith and (ii) the Survivor expressly agrees to assume all obligations of the General Partner, as appropriate, hereunder. Upon such contribution and assumption, the Survivor shall have the right and duty to amend this Agreement as set forth in this Section 7.1(d). The Survivor shall in good faith arrive at a new method for the calculation of the Cash Amount, the REIT Shares Amount and the Conversion Factor for a Partnership Unit, in each case with respect to each class of Partnership Unit, after any such merger or consolidation so as to approximate the existing method for such calculation as closely as reasonably possible. Such calculation shall take into account, among other things, the kind and amount of securities, cash, and other property that was receivable upon such merger or consolidation by a holder of REIT Shares or options, warrants or other rights relating thereto, and which a holder of each applicable class of Partnership Units could have acquired had such Partnership Units been exchanged immediately prior to such merger or consolidation. Such amendment to this Agreement shall provide for adjustments to such method of calculation, which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for herein with respect to the applicable Conversion Factor. The Survivor also shall in good faith modify the definition of REIT Shares; amend or delete, as applicable, the definitions of REIT Class A Shares and REIT Class T Shares; add, as applicable definitions for any new classes of  

36 

REIT Shares; make corresponding additions, deletions, or amendments with respect to Partnership Units; and make such amendments to Section 8.5 so as to approximate the existing rights and obligations set forth in Section 8.5 as closely as reasonably possible. The above provisions of this Section 7.1(d) shall similarly apply to successive mergers or consolidations permitted hereunder. 
  In respect of any transaction described in the preceding paragraph, the General Partner is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to structure such transaction to avoid causing the Limited Partners to recognize a gain for federal income tax purposes by virtue of the occurrence of or their participation in such transaction, provided, such efforts are consistent with the exercise of the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Cole Office   Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc. to the stockholders of the General Partner under applicable law. 
  (e)     Notwithstanding Section 7.1(c), 
  (i)     a General Partner may transfer all or any portion of its General Partnership Interest to (A) a wholly owned Subsidiary of such General Partner or (B) the owner of all of the ownership interests of such General Partner, and following a transfer of all of its General Partnership Interest, may withdraw as General Partner; and 
  (ii)     the General Partner may engage in a transaction not required by law or by the rules of any national securities exchange on which the REIT Shares are listed to be submitted to the vote of the holders of the REIT Shares. 
  7.2.   Admission of a Substitute or Additional General Partner  . A Person shall be admitted as a substitute or additional General Partner of the Partnership only if the following terms and conditions are satisfied: 
   (a)     the Person to be admitted as a substitute or additional General Partner shall have accepted and agreed to be bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by executing a counterpart and such other documents or instruments as may be required or appropriate in order to effect the admission of such Person as a General Partner, a certificate evidencing the admission of such Person as a General Partner shall have been filed for recordation and all other actions required by Section 2.5 in connection with such admission shall have been performed; 
  (b)     if the Person to be admitted as a substitute or additional General Partner is a corporation or a partnership, it shall have provided the Partnership with evidence satisfactory to counsel for the Partnership of such Person s authority to become a General Partner and to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement; and 
  (c)     counsel for the Partnership shall have rendered an opinion (relying on such opinions from other counsel in the state or any other jurisdiction as may be necessary) that the admission of the Person to be admitted as a substitute or additional General Partner is in conformity with the Act, and that none of the actions taken in connection with the admission of such Person as a substitute or additional General 

37 

Partner will cause (i) the Partnership to be classified other than as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, unless the Partnership is then treated as a disregarded entity (in which case such admission shall not cause the Partnership to be classified as other than a disregarded entity or, at the General Partner s election, a partnership for federal income tax purposes), or (ii) the loss of any Limited Partner s limited liability. 
  7.3.   Effect of Bankruptcy, Withdrawal, Death or Dissolution of a General Partner  . 
     (a)     Upon the occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy as to a General Partner (and its removal pursuant to Section 7.4(a)) or the death, withdrawal, removal or dissolution of a General Partner (except that, if a General Partner is, on the date of such occurrence, a partnership, the withdrawal, death, dissolution, Event of Bankruptcy as to, or removal of a partner in, such partnership shall be deemed not to be an Event of Bankruptcy or dissolution of such General Partner if the business of such General Partner is continued by the remaining partner or partners thereof), the Partnership shall be dissolved and terminated unless the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section 7.3(b). The merger of the General Partner with or into any entity that is admitted as a substitute or successor General Partner pursuant to Section 7.2 shall not be deemed to be the withdrawal, dissolution or removal of the General Partner. 
  (b)     Following the occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy as to a General Partner (and its removal pursuant to Section 7.4(a)) or the death, withdrawal, removal or dissolution of a General Partner (except that, if a General Partner is, on the date of such occurrence, a partnership, the withdrawal, death, dissolution, Event of Bankruptcy as to, or removal of a partner in, such partnership shall be deemed not to be an Event of Bankruptcy or dissolution of such General Partner if the business of such General Partner is continued by the remaining partner or partners thereof), the Limited Partners, within 90 days after such occurrence, may elect to continue the business of the Partnership for the balance of the term specified in Section 2.4 by selecting, subject to Section 7.2 and any other applicable provisions of this Agreement, a substitute General Partner by consent of Partners holding a majority of the Partnership Units in the Partnership. If the Limited Partners elect to continue the business of the Partnership and admit a substitute General Partner, the relationship with the Partners and of any Person who has acquired an interest of a Partner in the Partnership shall be governed by this Agreement. 
  7.4.   Removal of a General Partner  . 
  (a)     Upon the occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy as to, or the dissolution of, a General Partner, such General Partner shall be deemed to be removed automatically; provided, however, that if a General Partner is on the date of such occurrence a partnership, the withdrawal, death, dissolution, Event of Bankruptcy as to or removal of a partner in such partnership shall be deemed not to be an Event of Bankruptcy or dissolution of the General Partner if the business of such General Partner is continued by the remaining partner or partners thereof. The Limited Partners may not remove the General Partner, with or without cause. 

38 

(b)     If a General Partner has been removed pursuant to this Section 7.4 and the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section 7.3, such General Partner shall promptly transfer and assign its General Partnership Interest to the substitute General Partner approved by Partners holding a majority of the Partnership Units in the Partnership in accordance with Section 7.3(b) and otherwise admitted to the Partnership in accordance with Section 7.2. At the time of assignment, the removed General Partner shall be entitled to receive from the substitute General Partner the fair market value of the General Partnership Interest of such removed General Partner as reduced by any damages caused to the Partnership by such General Partner s removal. Such fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser mutually agreed upon by the General Partner and Limited Partners holding more than 50% of the Partnership Percentage Interests of the Limited Partners within 10 days following the removal of the General Partner. In the event that the parties are unable to agree upon an appraiser, the removed General Partner and Limited Partners holding more than 50% of the Partnership Percentage Interests of the Limited Partners shall each select an appraiser. Each such appraiser shall complete an appraisal of the fair market value of the removed General Partner s General Partnership Interest within 30 days of the General Partner s removal, and the fair market value of the removed General Partner s General Partnership Interest shall be the average of the two appraisals; provided, however, that if the higher appraisal exceeds the lower appraisal by more than 20% of the amount of the lower appraisal, the two appraisers, no later than 40 days after the removal of the General Partner, shall select a third appraiser who shall complete an appraisal of the fair market value of the removed General Partner s General Partnership Interest no later than 60 days after the removal of the General Partner. In such case, the fair market value of the removed General Partner s General Partnership Interest shall be the average of the two appraisals closest in value. 
  (c)     The General Partnership Interest of a removed General Partner, during the time after removal until the date of transfer under Section 7.4(b), shall be converted to that of a special Limited Partner; provided, however, such removed General Partner shall not have any rights to participate in the management and affairs of the Partnership, and shall not be entitled to any portion of the income, expense, Profit, gain or Loss allocations or cash distributions allocable or payable, as the case may be, to the Limited Partners. Instead, such removed General Partner shall receive and be entitled only to retain distributions or allocations of such items that it would have been entitled to receive in its capacity as General Partner, until the transfer is effective pursuant to Section 7.4(b). 
  (d)     All Partners shall have given and hereby do give such consents, shall take such actions and shall execute such documents as shall be legally necessary and sufficient to effect all the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.4. 
  Article VIII. 
  Rights and Obligations of the Limited Partners 
  8.1.   Management of the Partnership  . The Limited Partners shall not participate in the management or control of Partnership business, nor shall they transact any business for or on behalf of the Partnership, nor shall they have the power to sign for or bind the Partnership, such powers being vested solely and exclusively in the General Partner. 
    
  8.2.   Power of Attorney  . Each Limited Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, who may act for each Limited Partner and in its name, place and stead, and for its use and benefit, sign, acknowledge, swear to, deliver, file or record, at the appropriate public offices, any and all documents, certificates, and instruments as may be deemed necessary or desirable by  
  
    39 

the General Partner to carry out fully the provisions of this Agreement and the Act in accordance with their terms, which power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive the death, dissolution or legal incapacity of the Limited Partner, or the transfer by the Limited Partner of any part or all of its Partnership Interest. 
  8.3.   Limitation on Liability of Limited Partners  . No Limited Partner in its capacity as such shall be liable for any debts, liabilities, contracts or obligations of the Partnership. A Limited Partner shall be liable to the Partnership only to make payments of its Capital Contribution, if any, as and when due hereunder. After its Capital Contribution is fully paid, no Limited Partner shall, except as otherwise required by the Act, be required to make any further Capital Contributions or other payments or lend any funds to the Partnership. 
  8.4.   Ownership by Limited Partner of Corporate General Partner or Affiliate  . No Limited Partner shall at any time, either directly or indirectly, own any stock or other interest in the General Partner or in any Affiliate thereof, if such ownership by itself or in conjunction with other stock or other interests owned by other Limited Partners would, in the opinion of counsel for the Partnership, jeopardize the classification of the Partnership as a partnership (or as a disregarded entity, as the case may be) for federal income tax purposes. The General Partner shall be entitled to make such reasonable inquiry of the Limited Partners as is required to establish compliance by the Limited Partners with the provisions of this Section 8.4. 
  8.5.   Exchange Right  . 
  (a)     Subject to Sections 8.5(b), 8.5(c), 8.5(d), and 8.5(e), and subject to the potential modification of any rights or obligations provided for herein by agreement(s) between the Partnership and any one or more Limited Partners with respect to Partnership Units held by them, each Limited Partner shall have the right (the    Exchange Right   ) to require the Partnership to redeem on a Specified Exchange Date all or a portion of the Partnership Units held by such Limited Partner (such Partnership Units, the    Tendered Units   ) at an exchange price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount to be paid by the Partnership; provided, that such Partnership Units shall have been outstanding for at least one year. The Exchange Right shall be exercised pursuant to the delivery of an Exchange Notice to the Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) by the Limited Partner who is exercising the Exchange Right (the    Exchanging Partner    provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be obligated to satisfy such Exchange Right if the General Partner elects to purchase the Partnership Units subject to the Exchange Notice pursuant to Section 8.5(b); and provided further, that no Limited Partner may deliver more than two Exchange Notices during each calendar year. A Limited Partner may not exercise the Exchange Right for less than 1,000 Partnership Units or, if such Limited Partner holds less than 1,000 Partnership Units, all of the Partnership Units held by such Partner. The Exchanging Partner shall have no right, with respect to any Partnership Units so exchanged, to receive any distribution paid with respect to such Partnership Units if the record date for such distribution is on or after the Specified Exchange Date. 
    
  (b)     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.5(a), a Limited Partner that exercises the Exchange Right shall be deemed to have also offered to sell the Tendered Units to the General Partner, and the General Partner may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to purchase directly and acquire such Tendered Units by paying to the Exchanging Partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Shares Amount, as elected by the General Partner (in its sole and absolute discretion), on the Specified Exchange Date, whereupon the General Partner shall acquire the Tendered Units and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the owner of such Tendered Units. If the  
  
    40 

General Partner shall elect to exercise its right to purchase Tendered Units under this Section 8.5(b) with respect to an Exchange Notice, it shall so notify the Exchanging Partner within five business days after the receipt by the General Partner of such Exchange Notice. Unless the General Partner (in its sole and absolute discretion) shall exercise its right to purchase Tendered Units from the Exchanging Partner pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), the General Partner shall have no obligation to the Exchanging Partner or the Partnership with respect to the Exchanging Partner s exercise of an Exchange Right. In the event the General Partner shall exercise its right to purchase Tendered Units with respect to the exercise of an Exchange Right in the manner described in the first sentence of this Section 8.5(b), the Partnership shall have no obligation to pay any amount to the Exchanging Partner with respect to such Exchanging Partner s exercise of such Exchange Right, and each of the Exchanging Partner and the General Partner shall treat the transaction between the General Partner and the Exchanging Partner for federal income tax purposes as a sale of the Exchanging Partner s Tendered Units to the General Partner. Each Exchanging Partner agrees to execute such documents as the General Partner may reasonably require in connection with the issuance of REIT Shares to such Exchanging Partner upon exercise of its Exchange Right. 
  (c)     Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 8.5(a) and 8.5(b), a Limited Partner shall not be entitled to exercise the Exchange Right if the delivery of REIT Shares to such Partner on the Specified Exchange Date by the General Partner pursuant to Section 8.5(b) (regardless of whether or not the General Partner would in fact exercise its rights under Section 8.5(b)) would (i) result in such Partner or any other person owning, directly or indirectly, REIT Shares in excess of the ownership limitations described in the Articles of Incorporation and calculated in accordance therewith, (ii) result in REIT Shares being owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution), except as provided in the Articles of Incorporation, (iii) result in the General Partner being  closely held  within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code, (iv) cause the General Partner to own, directly or constructively, 10% or more of the ownership interests in a tenant of the General Partner s, the Partnership s, or a Subsidiary Partnership s real property within the meaning of Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code (except to the extent the General Partner determines that such ownership would be permitted pursuant to Section 856(d)(8), or (v) cause the acquisition of REIT Shares by such Partner to be  integrated  with any other distribution of REIT Shares for purposes of complying with the registration provisions of the Securities Act. The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, may waive any of the restrictions on exchange set forth in this Section 8.5(c); provided, however, that in the event any such restriction is waived, the Exchanging Partner shall be paid the Cash Amount. 

41 

(d)     Any Cash Amount to be paid to an Exchanging Partner pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall be paid on the Specified Exchange Date; provided, however, that the General Partner may elect to cause the Specified Exchange Date to be delayed for up to 180 days to the extent required for the General Partner to cause additional REIT Shares to be issued to provide financing to be used to make such payment of the Cash Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner agrees to use its best efforts to cause the closing of the acquisition of Tendered Units hereunder to occur as quickly as reasonably possible. 
  (e)     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner shall place appropriate restrictions on the ability of the Limited Partners to exercise their Exchange Rights as and if deemed necessary to ensure that the Partnership does not constitute a  publicly traded partnership  under Section 7704 of the Code. If and when the General Partner determines that imposing such restrictions is necessary, the General Partner shall give prompt written notice thereof (a    Restriction Notice   ) to each of the Limited Partners, which notice shall be accompanied by a copy of an opinion of counsel to the Partnership which states that, in the opinion of such counsel, restrictions are reasonably necessary in order to avoid the Partnership being treated as a  publicly traded partnership  under Section 7704 of the Code. 
  (f)     Each Limited Partner covenants and agrees with the General Partner that all Tendered Units shall be delivered to the Partnership or the General Partner, as the case may be, free and clear of all liens; and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the General Partner nor the Partnership shall be under any obligation to acquire Tendered Units that are or may be subject to any liens. Each Limited Partner further agrees that, if any state or local property transfer tax is payable as a result of the transfer of its Tendered Units to the Partnership or the General Partner, such Limited Partner shall assume and pay such transfer tax. 
  8.6.   Duties and Conflicts  . The General Partner recognizes that the Limited Partners and their Affiliates have or may have other business interests, activities and investments, some of which may be in conflict or competition with the business of the Partnership, and that such Persons are entitled to carry on such other business interests, activities and investments. The Limited Partners and their Affiliates may engage in or possess an interest in any other business or venture of any kind, independently or with others, on their own behalf or on behalf of other entities with which they are affiliated or associated, and such Persons may engage in any activities, whether or not competitive with the Partnership, without any obligation to offer any interest in such activities to the Partnership or to any Partner. Neither the Partnership nor any Partner shall have any right, by virtue of this Agreement, in or to such activities, or the income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of such activities, even if competitive with the business of the Partnership, and such activities shall not be deemed wrongful or improper. 

42 

Article IX. 
  Transfers of Limited Partnership Interests 
  9.1.   Purchase for Investment  . 
  (a)     Each Limited Partner hereby represents and warrants to the General Partner and to the Partnership that the acquisition of its Partnership Interest is made as a principal for its account for investment purposes only and not with a view to the resale or distribution of such Partnership Interest. 
  (b)     Each Limited Partner agrees that it will not sell, assign or otherwise transfer its Partnership Interest or any fraction thereof, whether voluntarily or by operation of law or at judicial sale or otherwise, to any Person who does not make the representations and warranties to the General Partner set forth in Section 9.1(a) above. 
  9.2.   Restrictions on Transfer of Limited Partnership Interests  . 
  (a)     Subject to the provisions of Sections 9.2(b), 9.2(c), and 9.2(d), no Limited Partner may offer,     or any of such Limited Partner s economic rights as a Limited Partner, whether voluntarily or by operation of law or at judicial sale or otherwise (collectively, a    Transfer   ), without the consent of the General Partner, which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole and absolute discretion. Any such purported transfer undertaken without such consent shall be considered to be null and void ab initio and shall not be given effect. The General Partner may require, as a condition of any Transfer to which it consents, that the transferor assume all costs incurred by the Partnership in connection therewith. 
  (b)     No Limited Partner may withdraw from the Partnership other than (i) as a result of a permitted Transfer (i.e., a Transfer consented to as contemplated by Section 9.2(a) above or Section 9.2(c) below or a Transfer made pursuant to Section 9.5 below) of all of its Partnership Units pursuant to this Article IX; or (ii) pursuant to an exchange of all of its Partnership Units pursuant to Section 8.5 above. Upon the permitted Transfer or redemption of all of a Limited Partner s Partnership Units, such Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited Partner. 
  (c)     Subject to Sections 9.2(d), 9.2(e), and 9.2(f), a Limited Partner may Transfer, with the consent of the General Partner, all or a portion of its Limited Partnership Interest to (i) a parent or parent s spouse, natural or adopted descendants, a spouse of any such descendant, a brother or sister, or a trust created by such Limited Partner for the benefit of such Limited Partner and/or any such person(s), for which trust such Limited Partner or any such person(s) is a trustee, (ii) a corporation controlled by a Person or Persons named in (i) above, or (iii) if the Limited Partner is an entity, its beneficial owners. 
  (d)     No Limited Partner may effect a Transfer of its Limited Partnership Interest, in whole or in part, if, in the opinion of legal counsel for the Partnership, such proposed Transfer would require the registration of the Limited Partnership Interest under  

43 

the Securities Act, or would otherwise violate any applicable federal or state securities or blue sky law (including investment suitability standards). 
  (e)     No Transfer by a Limited Partner of its Limited Partnership Interest, in whole or in part, may be made to any Person if (i) in the opinion of legal counsel for the Partnership, the transfer would result in the Partnership s being treated as an association taxable as a corporation (other than a qualified REIT subsidiary within the meaning of Section 856(i) of the Code), (ii) in the determination of the General Partner, after consultation with legal counsel for the Partnership, it would adversely affect the ability of the General Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT or subject the General Partner to any additional taxes under Section 857 or Section 4981 of the Code, or (iii) such transfer is effectuated through an  established securities market  or a  secondary market  (or the substantial equivalent thereof) within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code. 
  (f)     No transfer of a Limited Partnership Interest, in whole or in part, may be made to a lender to the Partnership or any Person who is related (within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.752-4(b)) to any lender to the Partnership whose loan constitutes a nonrecourse liability (within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.752-1(a)(2)), without the consent of the General Partner, which may be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion; provided, that as a condition to such consent the lender will be required to enter into an arrangement with the Partnership and the General Partner to exchange or redeem for the Cash Amount any Partnership Units in which a security interest is held simultaneously with the time at which such lender would be deemed to be a partner in the Partnership for purposes of allocating liabilities to such lender under Section 752 of the Code. 
  (g)     Any Transfer in contravention of any of the provisions of this Article IX shall be void and ineffectual and shall not be binding upon, or recognized by, the Partnership. 
  (h)     Prior to the consummation of any Transfer under this Article IX, the transferor and/or the transferee shall deliver to the General Partner such opinions, certificates and other documents as the General Partner shall request in connection with such Transfer. 
  9.3.   Admission of Substitute Limited Partner  . 
  (a)     Subject to the other provisions of this Article IX, an assignee of a Limited Partnership Interest (which shall be understood to include any purchaser, transferee, donee or other recipient of any disposition of such Limited Partnership Interest) shall be deemed admitted as a Limited Partner only with the consent of the General Partner and upon the satisfactory completion of the following: 
  (i)     the assignee shall have accepted and agreed to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement by executing a counterpart or an amendment thereof, including a revised   Exhibit A  , and such other documents or 

44 

instruments as the General Partner may require in order to effect the admission of such Person as a Limited Partner; 
  (ii)     to the extent required, an amended Certificate evidencing the admission of such Person as a Limited Partner shall have been signed, acknowledged and filed for record in accordance with the Act; 
  (iii)     the assignee shall have delivered a letter containing the representation set forth in Section 9.1(a) and the agreement set forth in Section 9.1(b); 
  (iv)     if the assignee is a corporation, partnership or trust, the assignee shall have provided the General Partner with evidence satisfactory to counsel for the Partnership of the assignee s authority to become a Limited Partner under the terms and provisions of this Agreement; 
  (v) the assignee shall have executed a power of attorney containing the terms and provisions set forth in Section 8.2 or shall have specifically agreed to be bound by the provisions of Section 8.2; 
  (vi) the assignee shall have paid all legal fees and other expenses of the Partnership and the General Partner and filing and publication costs (including reasonably attorney s fees and expenses) in connection with its substitution as a Limited Partner; and 
  (vii) the assignee shall have obtained the prior written consent of the General Partner to its admission as a Substitute Limited Partner, which consent may be given or denied in the exercise of the General Partner s sole and absolute discretion. 
  (b)     For the purpose of allocating Profit and Loss and distributing cash received by the Partnership, a Substitute Limited Partner shall be treated as having become, and appearing in the records of the Partnership as, a Partner upon the filing of the Certificate described in Section 9.3(a)(ii) or, if no such filing is required, the later of the date specified in the transfer documents or the date on which the General Partner has received all necessary instruments of transfer and substitution. 
  (c)     The General Partner shall cooperate with the Person seeking to become a Substitute Limited Partner by preparing the documentation required by this Section 9.3 and making all official filings and publications. The Partnership shall take all such action as promptly as practicable after the satisfaction of the conditions in this Article IX to the admission of such Person as a Limited Partner of the Partnership. 
  9.4.   Rights of Assignees of Limited Partnership Interests  . 
  (a)     Subject to the provisions of Sections 9.1 and 9.2, except as required by operation of law, the Partnership shall not be obligated for any purposes whatsoever to 

45 

recognize the assignment by any Limited Partner of its Limited Partnership Interest until the Partnership has received notice thereof. 
  (b)     Any Person who is the assignee of all or any portion of a Limited Partner s Limited Partnership Interest, but who does not become a Substitute Limited Partner and desires to make a further assignment of such Limited Partnership Interest, shall be subject to all the provisions of this Article IX to the same extent and in the same manner as any Limited Partner desiring to make an assignment of its Limited Partnership Interest. 
    
  9.5.   Effect of Bankruptcy, Death, Incompetence or Termination of a Limited Partner  . The occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy as to a Limited Partner, the death of a Limited Partner, or a final adjudication that a Limited Partner is incompetent (which term shall include, but not be limited to, insanity) shall not cause the termination or dissolution of the Partnership, and the business of the Partnership shall continue if an order for relief in a bankruptcy proceeding is entered against a Limited Partner, the trustee or receiver of his estate or, if he dies, his executor, administrator or trustee, or, if he is finally adjudicated incompetent, his committee, guardian or conservator, and any such Person shall have the rights of such Limited Partner for the purpose of settling or managing his estate property and such power as the bankrupt, deceased or incompetent Limited Partner possessed to assign all or any part of his Limited Partnership Interest and to join with the assignee in satisfying conditions precedent to the admission of the assignee as a Substitute Limited Partner. 
  9.6.   Joint Ownership of Interests  . A Limited Partnership Interest may be acquired by two individuals as joint tenants with right of survivorship, provided, that such individuals either are married or are related and share the same personal residence. The written consent or vote of both owners of any such jointly-held Limited Partnership Interest shall be required to constitute the action of the owners of such Limited Partnership Interest; provided, however, that the written consent of only one joint owner will be required if the Partnership has been provided with evidence satisfactory to the counsel for the Partnership that the actions of a single joint owner can bind both owners under the applicable laws of the state of residence of such joint owners. Upon the death of one owner of a Limited Partnership Interest held in a joint tenancy with a right of survivorship, the Limited Partnership Interest shall become owned solely by the survivor as a Limited Partner and not as an assignee. The Partnership need not recognize the death of one of the owners of a jointly held Limited Partnership Interest until it shall have received notice of such death. Upon notice to the General Partner from either owner, the General Partner shall cause the Limited Partnership Interest to be divided into two equal Limited Partnership Interests, which shall thereafter be owned separately by each of the former joint owners.

46 

any financial statements of the Partnership for the three most recent years; and (e) all documents and information required under the Act. Any Partner or its duly authorized representative, and any stockholder of the General Partner, upon paying the costs of collection, duplication and mailing, shall be entitled to inspect or copy such records during ordinary business hours. 
  10.2.   Custody of Partnership Funds; Bank Accounts  . 
  (a)     All funds of the Partnership not otherwise invested shall be deposited in one or more accounts maintained in such banking or brokerage institutions as the General Partner shall determine, and withdrawals shall be made only on such signature or signatures as the General Partner may, from time to time, determine. 
  (b)     All deposits and other funds not needed in the operation of the business of the Partnership may be invested by the General Partner in investment grade instruments (or investment companies whose portfolio consists primarily thereof), government obligations, certificates of deposit, bankers  acceptances and municipal notes and bonds. The funds of the Partnership shall not be commingled with the funds of any other Person except for such commingling as may necessarily result from an investment in those investment companies permitted by this Section 10.2(b) or from an investment in a Joint Venture, partnership, limited liability company or other business as contemplated by Article III. 
  10.3.   Fiscal and Taxable Year  . The fiscal and taxable year of the Partnership shall be the calendar year. 
  10.4.   Annual Tax Information and Report  . The General Partner will use its commercially reasonable efforts to supply within 75 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Partnership to each person who was a Limited Partner at any time during such year the tax information necessary to file such Limited Partner s individual tax returns as shall be reasonably required by law, and in all events the General Partner shall furnish such information within the time required by applicable law. 
  10.5.   Tax Matters Partner; Partnership Representative; Tax Elections; Special Basis Adjustments  . 
  (a)     For tax returns filed with respect to fiscal years beginning before the Effective Date of the Budget Act Partnership Audit Provisions, for the purposes of the Code, the General Partner shall serve as the tax matters partner of the Partnership (the    Tax Matters Partner   ) under Section 6231 of the Code (as in effect prior to such section s amendment by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74) (the    2015 Budget Act   )). Each Partner hereby consents to the General Partner serving as the Tax Matters Partner and agrees upon request of the General Partner to execute, certify, acknowledge, deliver, swear to, file and record at the appropriate public offices such further documents as may be necessary or appropriate to evidence such consent. References to Sections of the Code in this Section 10.5(a) refer to Code sections before amendment by the 2015 Budget Act. The Tax Matters Partner may: 

47 

(i)     agree to extend any statute of limitations with respect to the Partnership or any Subsidiary under Section 6229 of the Code; 
  (ii) file a request for administrative adjustment (including a request for substituted return treatment) under Section 6227 of the Code; 
    
  (iii) file a petition for judicial review, or any appeal with respect to any judicial determination, under Section 6226 or 6228 of the Code; 
  (iv) take any action to consent to, or to refuse to consent to, a settlement reflected in a decision of a court; or 
  (v) enter into any tax settlement agreement affecting the Partnership or any Subsidiary. 
  (b)     For tax returns filed with respect to fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017 (the    Effective Date of the Budget Act Partnership Audit Provisions   ), the General Partner shall take such reasonable actions as it believes will enhance the avoidance of the application to the Partnership of the provisions of Sections 6221 through 6241 of the Code, as amended by the 2015 Budget Act. If, however, such provisions do apply to the Partnership, the General Partner shall also act as the partnership representative (   Partnership Representative   ) for purposes of said Sections 6221 through 6241 of the Code. Each Partner hereby consents to the General Partner serving as the Partnership Representative and agrees upon request of the General Partner to execute, certify, acknowledge, deliver, swear to, file and record at the appropriate public offices such further documents as may be necessary or appropriate to evidence such consent. The Partnership Representative will be authorized to represent the Partnership (at the Partnership s expense) in connection with all examinations of the Partnership s affairs by tax authorities, including resulting administrative and judicial proceedings, and to (i) sign consents, enter into settlement and other agreements with such authorities with respect to any such examinations or proceedings and (ii) expend the Partnership s funds for professional services incurred in connection therewith. In such event, the Partnership Representative shall duly and timely elect under Code Section 6226 of the Code to require each Person who was a Partner during the taxable year of Partnership that was audited to personally bear any tax, interest and penalty resulting from adjustments based on such audit and shall notify each such Person (and the Internal Revenue Service) of their share of such audit adjustments and, if for any reason, the Partnership is liable for a tax, interest, addition to tax or penalty as a result of such an audit, each Person who was a Partner during the taxable year of the Partnership that was audited, even if such Person is no longer a Partner (unless a Substitute Limited Partner has agreed to bear such liability in an appropriate document evidencing a transfer), shall pay to the Partnership an amount equal to such Person s proportionate share of such liability, as determined by the General Partner, based on the amount each such Person should have borne (computed at the tax rate used to compute the Partnership s liability) had the Partnership s tax return for such taxable year reflected the audit adjustment, and the expense for the Partnership s payment of such tax, interest, addition to tax and penalty shall be specially allocated to such Persons (or their successors) in such proportions.

The taking of any action and the incurring of any expense by the General Partner in its capacity as the Tax Matters Partner or Partnership Representative, in connection with any such proceeding, except to the extent required by law, is a matter in the sole discretion of the Tax Matters Partner (or Partnership Representative) and the provisions on protection and indemnification of set forth in Section 6.3 above will be fully applicable to the General Partner when acting in its capacity as the Tax Matters Partner or Partnership Representative.

  Amendment of Agreement; Meetings 
  11.1.   Amendment  . The General Partner s consent shall be required for any amendment to this Agreement. The General Partner, without the consent of the Limited Partners, may amend this Agreement in any respect; provided, however, that the following amendments shall require the consent of the General Partner and the holders of a majority of the Partnership Units: 
  (a)     any amendment affecting the operation of the Conversion Factor or the Exchange Right (except as provided in Sections 8.5(d) or 7.1(d)) in a manner adverse to the Limited Partners; 
  (b)     any amendment that would adversely affect the rights of the Limited Partners to receive the distributions payable to them hereunder, other than with respect to the issuance of additional Partnership Units pursuant to Section 4.2; 
  (c)     any amendment that would alter the Partnership s allocations of Profit and Loss to the Limited Partners, other than with respect to the issuance of additional Partnership Units pursuant to Section 4.2; or 
  (d)     any amendment that would impose on the Limited Partners any obligation to make additional Capital Contributions to the Partnership. 
  The foregoing notwithstanding, the approval of any amendment to this Agreement that shall be part of a plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion involving the Partnership or the Partnership Interests shall be governed by Article XII. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Partners acknowledge that this Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically amended and the General Partner is authorized to amend this Agreement to the extent provided in Section 4.1 hereof. 
  11.2.   Meetings of Partners  . 
  (a)     The Partners may but shall not be required to hold any annual, periodic or other formal meetings. Meetings of the Partners may be called by the General Partner or by any Limited Partner or Limited Partners holding at least 10% of the Partnership Units. 
  (b)     Subject to Section 11.2(k), the Partner or Partners calling the meeting may designate any place within the State of Delaware as the place of meeting for any meeting of the Partners; and Partners holding at least a majority of the Partnership Units in the Partnership may designate any place outside the State of Delaware as the place of meeting for any meeting of the Partners. If no designation is made, or if a special meeting is called, the place of meeting shall be the principal place of business of the Partnership. 
  (c)     Except as provided in Section 11.2(d), written notice stating the Meeting Medium, the place, day and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called shall be delivered not less than ten (10) nor more than ninety (90) 

50 

days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the Partner or Partners calling the meeting, to each Partner entitled to vote at such meeting and to each Partner not entitled to vote who is entitled to notice of the meeting. 
  (d)     Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, with respect to any meeting of the Partners, any Partner who in person or by proxy shall have waived in writing notice of the meeting, either before or after such meeting, or who shall attend the meeting in person or by proxy, shall be deemed to have waived notice of such meeting unless such Partner attends for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, and does so object to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. 
  (e)     If Partners holding a majority of the Partnership Units shall meet at any time and place, either within or outside of the State of Delaware, in person or by proxy or through any Meeting Medium, and consent to the holding of a meeting at such time and place, such meeting shall be valid without call or notice, and at such meeting lawful action may be taken. 
  (f)     For the purpose of determining Partners entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of Partners or any adjournment thereof, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed shall be the record date. When a determination of Partners entitled to vote at any meeting of Partners has been made as provided in this Section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof. 
  (g)     Partners holding at least a majority of the Partnership Units entitled to vote at a meeting, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of Partners. In the absence of a quorum at any such meeting, Partners holding at least a majority of Partnership Units so represented may adjourn the meeting to another time and place. Any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting may be transacted at any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present. No notice of an adjourned meeting need be given if the time and place are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is for more than 120 days. The Partners present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal during such meeting of that number Partnership Units whose absence would cause less than a quorum to be present. 
  (h)     If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of Partners holding a majority of the Partnership Units entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall be binding on all Partners, unless the vote of a greater or lesser proportion or number of Partnership Units or Partners is otherwise required by applicable law or by this Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein or required under applicable law, Partners who have an interest (economic or otherwise) in the outcome of any particular matter upon which the Partners  vote or consent is required may vote or consent upon any such matter and their Partnership Units, vote or consent, as the case may be, shall be counted in the determination of whether the requisite matter was approved by the Partners. 

51 

(i)     At all meetings of Partners, a Partner may vote in person or by proxy executed in writing by the Partner or by the Partner s duly authorized attorney-in-fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the General Partner before or at the time of the meeting. No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy.(j)     Action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of Partners may be taken without a meeting if the action is evidenced by one or more written consents or approvals describing the action taken and signed by sufficient Partners or Partners holding sufficient Partnership Units, as the case may be, to approve such action had such action been properly voted on at a duly called meeting of the Partners. Action taken under this Section 11.2(j) is effective when the requisite Partners or Partners with the requisite Partnership Units, as the case may be, have signed the consent or approval, unless the consent specifies a different effective date. 
  (k)     Any meeting of Partners may be held in person, by telephone conference, by webcast or by other electronic means where all Partners participating can hear one another through such medium (a    Meeting Medium   ). Any Partner may vote at any meeting of the Partners held in any Meeting Medium by participating through such Meeting Medium or by e-mail or other means designed to ensure such Partner s vote is communicated to the General Partner. Any vote of the Partners may be held by any of the foregoing means or by written consent of the Partners, each of which may be referred to as a  meeting  of the Partners.

Any such plan of merger, plan of exchange, or plan of conversion shall otherwise comply with the requirements of this Agreement and the Act. 

52 

(b)    Any merger pursuant to a plan of merger described in Section 12.1(a)(i) shall be conditioned upon the merger being permitted by the laws under which each other entity that is a party to the merger is incorporated or organized or by the constituent documents of such other entity that are not inconsistent with such laws. Any exchange pursuant to a plan of exchange described in Section 12.1(a)(ii) shall be conditioned upon the issuance of shares or other interests of the acquiring foreign limited partnership or other entity being permitted by the laws under which such foreign limited partnership or other entity is incorporated or organized or is not inconsistent with such laws. Any conversion pursuant to a plan of conversion described in Section 12.1(a)(iii) shall be conditioned upon such conversion being permitted by, or not inconsistent with, the laws of the jurisdiction in which the converted entity is to be incorporated, formed or organized and the incorporation, formation or organization of the converted entity is effected in compliance with such laws. 
  (c)     The Partnership may adopt a plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion if the General Partner acts upon and the holders of a majority of the outstanding Partnership Units (if required by Section 12.2 below) approve the plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion in the manner prescribed in Section 12.2 below. 
  12.2.   Approval of Plan of Merger, Exchange or Conversion  .

  (i)     the General Partner shall adopt a resolution recommending that the plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion be approved by the holders of the outstanding Partnership Units, unless the General Partner determines that for any reason it should not make that recommendation, in which case the General Partner shall adopt a resolution directing that the plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion be submitted to the holders of the outstanding Partnership Units for approval without recommendation; and 
  (ii)     the Partners entitled to vote on the plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion must approve the plan as set forth in Section 12.2(e). 
  (c)     The General Partner may condition its submission to the holders of the outstanding Partnership Units of a plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion, and the effectiveness of such plan, on any basis, including without limitation that a specified percentage of the Partnership Units in excess of a majority of the Partnership Percentage Interests be required for the approval of the plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion. 
  (d)     The General Partner shall notify each Limited Partner, whether or not entitled to vote, of the meeting of at which the plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion is to be submitted for approval in accordance with this Section 12.2, Section 11.2, and applicable law.

  (f)     Unless applicable law otherwise requires (in which case the approval requirements of the preceding provisions of this Section 12.2 shall continue to be required), (1) approval by the Partners on a plan of exchange shall not be required, and the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.2 do not apply, if the Partnership is the acquiring entity in the plan of exchange, and (2) approval by the Partners on a plan of merger or a plan of conversion shall not be required and the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.2 do not apply, if: 
  (i)     a limited partnership is the sole surviving or resulting entity;

  (iv)     the General Partner adopts a resolution approving the plan of merger or plan of conversion. 
  (g)     After a plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion is approved, and at any time before the merger, exchange or conversion has become effective, the plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion may be abandoned (subject to any contractual rights by any of the entities that are a party thereto), without action by the Partners, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion or, if no such procedures are set forth in the plan, in the manner determined by the General Partner. 
  12.3.   Rights of Dissenting Limited Partners  . 
  (a)     In the absence of fraud in the transaction, the remedy provided by this Section 12.3 to a Limited Partner voting against any merger, exchange or conversion or objecting to a merger, exchange or conversion approved by the written consent of Partners (a    Dissenting Limited Partner   ) is the exclusive remedy for the recovery of the value of his Limited Partnership Interest or money damages with respect to the transaction. If the existing, surviving, or new corporation or limited partnership (foreign or domestic) or other entity, as the case may be, complies with the requirements of this 

54 

Section 12.3, any Dissenting Limited Partner who fails to comply with the requirements of this Section 12.3 shall not be entitled to bring suit for the recovery of the value of his Limited Partnership Interests or money damages with respect to the transaction. A  Dissenting Limited Partner  in respect of any merger, exchange or conversion shall expressly exclude any Limited Partner who votes in favor of the related plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion or who abstains or fails to timely vote therefor. In the event of a plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion approved by written consent, a  Dissenting Limited Partner  in respect of any related merger, exchange or conversion shall expressly exclude Limited Partners who provide such written consent and Limited Partners who fail to object to the merger, exchange or conversion and demands payment for such Limited Partner s Limited Partnership Interest in writing to the General Partner within twenty (20) days after notice to the Limited Partners of the receipt by the Partnership of written consents sufficient to approve such merger, exchange or conversion. All such Limited Partners who are not included within the definition of Dissenting Limited Partner in respect of any merger, exchange or conversion shall participate in the merger, exchange or conversion according to the approved plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion. 
  (b)     Any Dissenting Limited Partner who has opted for payment for his Limited Partnership Interests shall not thereafter be entitled to vote or exercise any other rights of a Limited Partner except the right to receive payment for his Limited Partnership Interests and the right to maintain an appropriate action to obtain relief on the ground that the transaction would be or was fraudulent. Limited Partnership Interests of Dissenting Limited Partners for which payment has been made shall not thereafter be considered outstanding for the purposes of any subsequent vote of the Partners. 
  (c)     Within twenty (20) days after a Dissenting Limited Partner votes against any plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion which is approved by a vote of the Partners, or in connection with a Limited Partner s objection to any plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion approved by the written consent of the Partners, the Dissenting Limited Partner may demand by written notice to the General Partner that payment for his Limited Partnership Interest be made. Upon receipt of such a payment demand, the General Partner shall (i) make a notation on the records of the Partnership that such demand has been made and (ii) within a reasonable period of time after the later of the receipt of a payment demand or the consummation of the merger, exchange or conversion, cause the Partnership to pay to the Dissenting Limited Partner the fair value of such Dissenting Limited Partner s Partnership Interest without interest. The fair value of a Dissenting Limited Partner s Partnership Interest shall be an amount equal to the Dissenting Limited Partner s pro rata share (as would be determined under Section 5.6 if the Partnership were liquidating) of the appraised value of the net assets of the Partnership based on an appraisal of all assets of the Partnership from a Competent Independent Expert. The assets of the Partnership shall be appraised on a consistent basis. The appraisal shall be based on an evaluation of all relevant information and shall include the current value of the Partnership s assets as of the date immediately prior to the proposed merger, exchange or conversion. The appraisal shall assume an orderly liquidation of the Partnership s assets over a twelve (12) month period, shall consider other balance sheet items, and shall be net of the assumed cost of sale. The terms of the 

55 

engagement of the appraiser shall clearly state that the engagement is for the benefit of the Partnership and its Partners. A summary of the independent appraisal, including all material assumptions underlying the appraisal, shall be provided to Dissenting Limited Partners in connection with the payment of the fair value of their Limited Partnership Interests. 
  (d)     If a Dissenting Limited Partner shall fail to make a payment demand within the period provided in Section 12.3(c) or, in respect of a plan of merger, plan of exchange or plan of conversion approved by written consent of the Partners, shall fail to provide notice of dissent within the period set forth in Section 12.3(a), such Dissenting Limited Partner and all persons claiming under him shall be conclusively presumed to have approved and ratified the merger, conversion or exchange and shall be bound thereby, the right of such Dissenting Limited Partner to be paid the fair value of his Limited Partnership Interest shall cease, and his status as a Limited Partner shall be restored without prejudice to any proceedings which may have been taken during the interim, and such Dissenting Limited Partner shall be entitled to receive any distributions made to Limited Partners in the interim.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, where, pursuant to a soliciting dealer s internal supervisory procedures, final and internal supervisory review is conducted at a different location than that at which subscription documents and instruments of payment are received from Subscribers, by the end of the next business day after receipt by the soliciting dealer of a subscription agreement and instrument of payment for the Offering, such subscription document and instrument of payment will be transmitted by the soliciting dealer to the office of the soliciting dealer conducting such final internal supervisory review (the    Final Review Office   ). By the end of the next business day following receipt by the Final Review Office of the subscription agreement and instrument of payment, if the subscription is suitable and the paperwork is in good order, the Final Review Office will (x) send the subscription documents to the Dealer Manager, and the Dealer Manager, the Company or their respective agents will send to the Escrow Agent each Subscriber s name, address, number of shares purchased, and purchase price remitted, and (y) transmit the instrument of payment from such Subscribers for deposit with the Escrow Agent in accordance with the deposit procedures set forth above. The Escrow Agent agrees to maintain the funds contributed by the Pennsylvania Subscribers and the Washington Subscribers in a manner in which they each may be separately accounted for on the records of Escrow Agent so that the requirements of Section 3 of this Agreement can be met. The Escrow Account will be established and maintained in such a way as to permit the interest income calculations described in paragraph 7. The Company shall, and shall cause its agents to, cooperate with the Escrow Agent in separately accounting for Pennsylvania and Washington subscription proceeds in the Escrow Account, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon information provided by the Company or its agents in this regard. 
  2.     The Escrow Agent agrees to promptly process for collection the instruments of payment upon deposit into the Escrow Account. Deposits shall be held in the Escrow Account until such funds are disbursed in accordance with paragraph 3 hereof. Prior to disbursement of the funds deposited in the Escrow Account, such funds shall not be subject to claims by creditors of the Escrow Agent, the Company, the Dealer Manager, any soliciting dealer or any of their respective affiliates. If any of the instruments of payment are returned to the Escrow Agent for nonpayment prior to receipt of the Required Capital or, in connection with subscriptions from Pennsylvania Subscribers or Washington Subscribers, the Pennsylvania Required Capital or the Washington Required Capital, respectively, the Escrow Agent shall promptly notify the Dealer Manager and the Company in writing via mail, email or facsimile of such nonpayment, and is authorized to debit the Escrow Account in the amount of such returned payment as well as any interest earned on the amount of such payment. 
  3.     (a)     (i) Subject to the provisions of subparagraphs 3(b)-3(g) below, once the collected funds in the Escrow Account, less any funds received from Pennsylvania Subscribers and the Washington Subscribers, are an amount equal to or greater than the Required Capital, the Escrow Agent shall promptly notify the Company and, upon receiving written instruction from the Company, (A) promptly disburse to the Company, by check, ACH or wire transfer, the funds in the Escrow Account representing the gross purchase price for the Stock less any funds received from Pennsylvania Subscribers and the Washington Subscribers, and (B) within five business days after the first business day of the succeeding month, disburse to the Company any interest thereon pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph 3(g). After such time the Escrow Account shall remain open and the Company shall continue to cause subscriptions for the  
  
   2 

Stock to be deposited therein until the Company informs the Escrow Agent in writing to cease depositing subscriptions received from Subscribers other than Pennsylvania Subscribers and Washington Subscribers, and thereafter any subscription documents and instruments of payment received by the Escrow Agent from Subscribers other than Pennsylvania Subscribers and Washington Subscribers shall be forwarded directly to the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term  collected funds  shall mean all funds received by the Escrow Agent that have cleared normal banking channels and are in the form of cash or cash equivalent. After the satisfaction of the aforementioned provisions of this paragraph 3(a)(i), in the event the Company receives subscriptions made payable to the Escrow Agent (other than subscriptions from Pennsylvania Subscribers and Washington Subscribers), such subscription proceeds may continue to be received in this account generally, but to the extent such proceeds shall not be subject to escrow due to the satisfaction of the aforementioned provisions of this paragraph 3(a)(i), such proceeds are not subject to this Escrow Agreement and at the instruction of the Company to the Escrow Agent shall be transferred from the Escrow Account or deposited directly into, as the case may be, a commercial deposit account in the name of the Company (the    Deposit Account   ) that has been previously established by the Company, unless otherwise directed by the Company. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it shall do all things necessary in order to establish the Deposit Account, which, if established with the Escrow Agent, shall be subject to the Escrow Agent s usual account guidelines and regulations, prior to its use. No provisions of this Escrow Agreement shall apply to the Deposit Account. 
  (ii) regardless of any release of funds from the Escrow Account from Subscribers other than Washington Subscribers and Pennsylvania Subscribers, the Company, the Dealer Manager and soliciting dealers shall continue to forward instruments of payment received from Washington Subscribers for deposit into the Escrow Account to the Escrow Agent until such time as the Company notifies the Escrow Agent in writing that (1) total subscription proceeds (including the amount then in the Escrow Account from Washington Subscribers, but less any funds received from Pennsylvania Subscribers) equal or exceed the Washington Required Capital or (2) total subscription proceeds (including the amount then in the Escrow Account from Washington Subscribers and Pennsylvania Subscribers) equal or exceed the Pennsylvania Required Capital. Promptly after receipt by the Escrow Agent of either such notice, the Escrow Agent shall (A) disburse to the Company, by check, ACH or wire transfer, the funds then in the Escrow Account representing the gross purchase price for the Stock from Washington Subscribers, and (B) within five business days after the first business day of the succeeding month, disburse to the Company any interest thereon pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph 3(g). Following such disbursements, any instruments of payment received by the Escrow Agent from Washington Subscribers shall not be subject to this Escrow Agreement and shall be deposited directly into the Deposit Account, as instructed in writing by the Company pursuant to subparagraph 3(a)(i) above. 
  (iii) regardless of any release of funds from the Escrow Account from Subscribers other than Pennsylvania Subscribers, the Company, the Dealer Manager and soliciting dealers shall continue to forward instruments of payment received from Pennsylvania Subscribers for deposit into the Escrow Account to the Escrow Agent until such time as the Company notifies the Escrow Agent in writing that total subscription proceeds (including the amount then in the Escrow Account from Washington Subscribers and Pennsylvania Subscribers) equal or exceed the Pennsylvania Required Capital. Promptly after receipt by the Escrow Agent of such notice, the Escrow Agent shall (A) disburse to the Company, by check, ACH or wire transfer, the funds then in the Escrow Account representing the gross purchase price for the Stock from Pennsylvania Subscribers, and (B) within five business days after the first business day of the succeeding month, disburse to the Company any interest thereon pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph 3(g). Following such disbursements, the Escrow Agent shall close the Escrow Account, and thereafter any instruments of payment received by the Escrow Agent from Pennsylvania Subscribers shall  
  
   3 

not be subject to this Escrow Agreement and shall be deposited directly into the Deposit Account, as instructed in writing by the Company pursuant to subparagraph 3(a)(i) above. 
  (b)     Within four business days of the close of business on the date that is one year following the effective date of the Offering (the Company will notify the Escrow Agent of the effective date of the Offering) (the    Expiration Date   ), the Escrow Agent shall promptly notify the Company if it is not in receipt of evidence of deposits for the purchase of Stock providing for aggregate offering proceeds that equal or exceed the Required Capital. Within ten days following the date of such notice, the Escrow Agent shall promptly return directly to each Subscriber the collected funds deposited in the Escrow Account on behalf of such Subscriber (unless earlier disbursed in accordance with paragraph 3(c)), or shall return the instruments of payment delivered, but not yet processed for collection prior to such time, in either case, together with interest income (which interest shall be paid within five business days after the first business day of the succeeding month) in the amounts calculated pursuant to paragraph 7 for each Subscriber at the address provided by the Dealer Manager or the Company or their respective agents to the Escrow Agent, which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon. Notwithstanding the above, in the event the Escrow Agent has not received an executed IRS Form W-9 at such time for each Subscriber, the Escrow Agent shall remit an amount to the Subscribers in accordance with the provisions hereof, withholding the applicable percentage for backup withholding required by the Internal Revenue Code, as then in effect, from any interest income on subscription proceeds (determined in accordance with paragraph 7) attributable to each Subscriber for whom the Escrow Agent does not possess an executed IRS Form W-9. However, the Escrow Agent shall not be required to remit any payments until the Escrow Agent has collected funds represented by such payments. 
  (c)     Notwithstanding subparagraphs 3(a) and 3(b) above, if the Escrow Agent is not in receipt of evidence of subscriptions accepted on or before the close of business on such date that is 120 days after the effective date of the Offering (the    Initial Escrow Period   ), and instruments of payment dated not later than that date, for the purchase of Stock providing for total purchase proceeds from all sources not affiliated with the Company that equal or exceed the Pennsylvania Required Capital, the Escrow Agent shall promptly notify the Company. Thereafter, the Company shall send to each Pennsylvania Subscriber by certified mail within ten (10) calendar days after the end of the Initial Escrow Period a notification in the form of   Exhibit A   attached hereto. If, pursuant to such notification, a Pennsylvania Subscriber requests the return of his or her subscription funds within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the notification (the    Request Period   ), the Escrow Agent shall, within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of such request, refund directly to each Pennsylvania Subscriber the collected funds deposited in the Escrow Account on behalf of such Pennsylvania Subscriber or shall return the instruments of payment delivered, but not yet processed for collection prior to such time, to the address provided by the Dealer Manager or the Company or their respective agents to the Escrow Agent, which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, together with interest income (which interest shall be paid within five business days after the first business day of the succeeding month) in the amounts calculated pursuant to paragraph 7. Notwithstanding the above, if the Escrow Agent has not received an executed IRS Form W-9 for such Pennsylvania Subscriber, the Escrow Agent shall thereupon remit an amount to such Pennsylvania Subscriber in accordance with the provisions hereof, withholding the applicable percentage for backup withholding required by the Internal Revenue Code, as then in effect, from any interest income earned on subscription proceeds (determined in accordance with paragraph 7) attributable to such Pennsylvania Subscriber. However, the Escrow Agent shall not be required to remit such payments until the Escrow Agent has collected funds represented by such payments. 
  (d)     The subscription funds of Pennsylvania Subscribers who do not request the return of their subscription funds within the Request Period shall remain in the Escrow Account for successive 120-day  
  
   4 

escrow periods (a    Successive Escrow Period   ), each commencing automatically upon the termination of the prior Successive Escrow Period, and the Company and Escrow Agent shall follow the notification and payment procedure set forth in subparagraph 3(c) above with respect to the Initial Escrow Period for each Successive Escrow Period until the occurrence of the earliest of (i) the Expiration Date (if the Company has not received the Required Capital on or before the Expiration Date), (ii) the receipt and acceptance by the Company of subscriptions for the purchase of Stock with total purchase proceeds that equal or exceed the Pennsylvania Required Capital and the disbursement of the funds from Pennsylvania Subscribers from the Escrow Account on the terms specified herein, or (iii) all funds held in the Escrow Account from Pennsylvania Subscribers having been returned to the Pennsylvania Subscribers in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
  (e)     In the event that the Offering is terminated prior to the receipt of the Washington Required Capital, the Company shall notify the Escrow Agent of the termination of the Offering. Within ten days following the date of such notice, the Escrow Agent shall promptly return directly to each Washington Subscriber the collected funds deposited in the Escrow Account on behalf of such Washington Subscriber, or shall return the instruments of payment delivered, but not yet processed for collection prior to such time, in either case, together with interest income (which interest shall be paid within five business days after the first business day of the succeeding month) in the amounts calculated pursuant to paragraph 7 for each such Washington Subscriber at the address provided by the Dealer Manager or the Company or their respective agents to the Escrow Agent, which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon. Notwithstanding the above, in the event the Escrow Agent has not received an executed IRS Form W-9 at such time for any Washington Subscriber, the Escrow Agent shall remit an amount to such Washington Subscriber in accordance with the provisions hereof, withholding the applicable percentage for backup withholding required by the Internal Revenue Code, as then in effect, from any interest income earned on subscription proceeds (determined in accordance with paragraph 7) attributable to such Washington Subscriber. However, the Escrow Agent shall not be required to remit such payments until the Escrow Agent has collected funds represented by such payments. 
  (f)     If the Company rejects any subscription for which the Escrow Agent has collected funds, the Escrow Agent shall, upon the written request of the Company, promptly issue a refund to the rejected Subscriber at the address provided by the Dealer Manager or the Company or their respective agents, which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon. If the Company rejects any subscription for which the Escrow Agent has not yet collected funds but has submitted the Subscriber s check for collection, the Escrow Agent shall promptly return the funds in the amount of the Subscriber s check to the rejected Subscriber, at the address provided by the Dealer Manager or the Company or their respective agents, which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, after such funds have been collected. If the Escrow Agent has not yet submitted a rejected Subscriber s check for collection, the Escrow Agent shall promptly remit the Subscriber s check directly to the Subscriber. 
  (g)     At any time after funds are disbursed upon the Company s acceptance of subscriptions pursuant to subparagraph 3(a) above, on the fifth business day following the first business day of the next succeeding month following the date of such acceptance, the Escrow Agent shall promptly provide directly to the Company the amount of the interest payable to the Company. However, the Escrow Agent shall not be required to remit any payments until the Escrow Agent has collected the funds represented by such payments. 
  In the event that instruments of payment are returned for nonpayment, the Escrow Agent is authorized to debit the Escrow Account in accordance with paragraph 2 hereof. 
  
   5 

4.     The Escrow Agent shall provide to the Company monthly statements (or more frequently as reasonably requested by the Company) which include, without limitation, if such amounts are not available to the Company at least daily pursuant to the  UMBDirect  program, the account balance in the Escrow Account, the account balance of the funds in the Escrow Account from Pennsylvania Subscribers, the account balance of the funds in the Escrow Account from Washington Subscribers, and the activity in the Escrow Account and, separately, the activity involving Pennsylvania Subscribers and Washington Subscribers since the last report. The Escrow Agent will provide access to its  UMBDirect  program to allow the Company to view account balances for the Escrow Account and the funds in the Escrow Account from Pennsylvania Subscribers and Washington Subscribers at any time. 
  5.     Prior to the disbursement of funds deposited in the Escrow Account in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 hereof, the Escrow Agent shall invest all of the funds deposited as well as earnings and interest derived therefrom in the Escrow Account in the  Short-Term Investments  specified below at the written direction of the Company, unless the costs to the Company for the making of such investment are reasonably expected to exceed the anticipated interest earnings from such investment in which case the funds and interest thereon shall remain in the Escrow Account until the balance in the Escrow Account reaches the minimum amount necessary for the anticipated interest earnings from such investment to exceed the costs to the Company for the making of such investment, as determined by the Company based upon applicable interest rates. In the absence of written direction from the Company, the Escrow Agent shall invest and reinvest all funds in UMB Money Market Special, a UMB Bank interest-bearing money market account. 
   Short-Term Investments  include obligations of, or obligations guaranteed by, the United States government or bank money-market accounts or certificates of deposit of national or state banks that have deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (including certificates of deposit of any bank acting as a depository or custodian for any such funds) which mature on or before the Expiration Date, unless such instrument cannot be readily sold or otherwise disposed of for cash by the Expiration Date without any dissipation of the offering proceeds invested. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,   Exhibit B   hereto sets forth specific Short-Term Investments that shall be deemed permissible investments hereunder. 
  The following securities are not permissible investments: 
    
           (a) 
    money market funds; 
              (b) 
    corporate equity or debt securities; 
              (c) 
    repurchase agreements; 
              (d) 
    bankers  acceptances; 
              (e) 
    commercial paper; and 
              (f) 
    municipal securities. 
     It is hereby expressly agreed and stipulated by the parties hereto that the Escrow Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion hereunder and shall have no investment or management responsibility and, accordingly, shall have no duty to, or liability for its failure to, provide investment recommendations or investment advice to the parties hereto. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Escrow Agent shall never be required to use, advance or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or the exercise of any of its rights and powers hereunder, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 9. 
  
   6 

6.     The Escrow Agent is entitled to rely upon written instructions received from the Company or the Dealer Manager or their respective agents that the Escrow Agent reasonably believes are valid or genuine; provided that, if in the Escrow Agent s opinion, any instructions from the Company or the Dealer Manager or their respective agents are unclear, the Escrow Agent may request clarification from the Company or the Dealer Manager or their respective agents, as applicable, prior to taking any action, and if such instructions continue to be unclear, the Escrow Agent may rely upon written instructions from the Company s legal counsel in distributing or continuing to hold any funds. However, the Escrow Agent shall not be required to disburse any funds attributable to instruments of payment that have not been processed for collection, until such funds are collected and then shall disburse such funds in compliance with the disbursement instructions from the Company or the Dealer Manager or their respective agents. 
  7.     If (a) the Offering terminates prior to receipt of the Required Capital, the Pennsylvania Required Capital or the Washington Required Capital, or (b) one or more Pennsylvania Subscribers elects to have his or her subscription returned in accordance with paragraph 3, interest income earned in the Escrow Account on subscription proceeds deposited in the Escrow Account (the    Escrow Income   ) shall be remitted to the applicable Subscribers at the addresses provided by the Dealer Manager or the Company or their respective agents to the Escrow Agent, which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, in accordance with paragraph 3 and without any deductions for escrow expenses. The Company shall reimburse the Escrow Agent for all escrow expenses. If the Escrow Agent remits interest income pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be responsible for any necessary federal tax reporting associated with such income; provided, however, that the Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any other tax reporting associated with this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall remit all such Escrow Income in accordance with paragraph 3. If the Company chooses to leave the Escrow Account open to Subscribers other than Pennsylvania Subscribers and Washington Subscribers after receiving the Required Capital, then it shall make regular acceptances of such subscriptions therein, but no less frequently than monthly, and the Escrow Income from the last such acceptance shall be calculated and remitted to the Company pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 3(g). 
  8.     The Escrow Agent shall receive compensation from the Company as set forth in   Exhibit C   attached hereto, which such Exhibit C is hereby incorporated by reference. 
  9.     In performing any of its duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability to anyone for any damages, losses, or expenses, except for damages, losses, or expenses arising from or related to the willful misconduct, breach of trust, or gross negligence of Escrow Agent. Accordingly, the Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability with respect to any action taken or omitted (a) in good faith upon advice of the Escrow Agent s counsel given with respect to any questions relating to the Escrow Agent duties and responsibilities under this Agreement, or (b) in reliance upon any instrument, including any written instrument or instruction provided for in this Agreement, not only as to its due execution and validity and effectiveness of its provisions but also as to the truth and accuracy of information contained therein, which the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, to have been signed or presented by a proper person or persons and to conform to the provisions of this Agreement. 
  10.     The Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless against any and all unaffiliated third party losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys  fees and disbursements, that may be imposed on or incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with acceptance of appointment as the Escrow Agent hereunder, or the performance of the duties hereunder, including any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving the subject matter hereof, except where such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses result from willful misconduct, breach of trust, or gross negligence of Escrow Agent. 
  
   7 

11.     In the event of a dispute between the parties hereto sufficient in the Escrow Agent s discretion to justify doing so, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to tender into the registry or custody of any court of competent jurisdiction all money or property in its hands under this Agreement, together with such legal pleadings as deemed appropriate, and thereupon be discharged from all further duties and liabilities under this Agreement. In the event of any uncertainty as to the duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent may refuse to act under the provisions of this Agreement pending order of a court of competent jurisdiction and shall have no liability to the Company or to any other person as a result of such action. Any such legal action may be brought in such court, as the Escrow Agent shall determine to have jurisdiction thereof. The filing of any such legal proceedings shall not deprive the Escrow Agent of its compensation earned prior to such filing. 
  12.     All communications and notices required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered personally or by messenger or by overnight delivery service or when received via telecopy or other electronic transmission, in all cases addressed to the person for whom it is intended at such person s address set forth below or to such other address as a party shall have designated by notice in writing (including by e-mail) to the other party in the manner provided by this paragraph:

The application of said funds into a deposit account or to forward such funds directly to the Company, in either case directed by the Company shall be a full acquittance to the Escrow Agent, who shall not be responsible for the application of said funds thereafter. 
  18.

The Escrow Agent, or its agent, shall complete an OFAC search, in compliance with its policy and procedures, of each subscription check and shall inform the Company if a subscription check fails the OFAC search. The Company shall provide a copy of each subscription check in order that the Escrow Agent, or its agent, may perform such OFAC search.

    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;
