INTRODUCTION 

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

MMA   Capital Management, LLC, the registrant, was organized in 1996 as a Delaware limited liability company.    Unless the context otherwise requires,   and   w  hen used in this     R  eport  , the    Company,       MMA,       we,       our    or    us    refer  s   to   MMA Capital Management, LLC and its subsidiaries  . 

The Company partners with institutional capital to create and manage investments in affordable housing and renewable energy.  We invest for   our own account and co-invest with our institutional capital partners.  We derive revenue from returns on our investments as well as asset management, performance and other fees from the investments  ,     funds and ventures we manage.  

T  he Company operate  s   through three reportable segments       United States (   U.S.   )   Operations, International Operations and Corporate Operations.   

U.S. Operations 

Our U.S. Operations segment consists of three business lines: Leveraged Bonds,   Low Income Housing Tax Credit (   LIHTC   )    a  nd Energy Capital and Other Investments (previously referred to as  Other Investments and Obligations  in the Company s 2015 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q).  

Leveraged Bonds 

In our Leveraged Bonds business   line  ,     we primarily own and manage bonds   for our own account   that   financ  e   affordable   housing and infrastructure in the   U  .  S.             

The   bonds held by the Company are   primarily   fixed rate   and   unrated  .    Our   bonds   are   also   generally   tax-exempt and   collateralized by affordable multifamily rental properties  .    S  ubstantially all of the rental units in   these multifamily   properties  , which may be subsidized by the government,     have   tenant income   and rent     restriction  s  .         

The   Company also has a small  er     portfolio   of other real estate   bonds  .  This   portfolio   include  s     municipal bond  s   that finance the development of infrastructure   for   a    mixed-use commercial development and   is   secured by incremental tax revenues generated from the   development  .    Our other real estate bonds also include senior investments in a trust collateralized by a pool of tax-exempt municipal bonds that finance a variety of non-profit projects such as healthcare and educational facilities, as well as a subordinated investment in a collateralized mortgage backed security that finances multifamily housing.   

The   Company has financed its ownership of a majority of its investments in bonds through total return swap (   TRS   )   agreements  .  These financing arrangements, which enable the Company to retain the economic risks and rewards of underlying   fixed rate   bond positions, generally require the Company to pay a variable rate of interest that resets on a weekly basis.  The Company has also executed TRS   agreements   to synthetically acquire the total return of multifamily bonds that it did not own.    However, as further discussed in Notes to Consolidated   Financial Statements   Note 5,  Debt  and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 6,    Derivative Instruments,  the Company   has hedged some of its   interest   rate risk.  

Table     1   provides   key metrics related to all bonds   in which we have an economic interest,   including   bonds that are not recognized for financial statement purposes but for which the Company maintains economic risks and rewards through TRS   agreement  s that the Company accounts for as derivatives as of September 30, 2016 (such bonds and TRS   agreement  s are collectively referred to as the    Bond Portfolio   )  .    See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 5,  Debt  and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 6,  Derivative Instruments  for more information about how TRS   agreement  s are reported in the Company s financial statements.

Table   1  :  Bond Portfolio - Summary 

(1) 

Non-performing is defined as bonds that are 30 days or more past due in either principal or interest.      

(2) 

This amount includes subordinated bonds with must-pay coupons with a  n     unpaid principal balance (   UPB   )   of $  7.6   million and a fair value of $  12.5   million.      

(3) 

Subordinated cash flow bonds do not have must-pay coupons and are payable out of available cash flow only. A portion of the debt service has been collected on these bonds over the preceding 12 months  .       H  owever, debt service is not calculated on these bonds as non-payment of debt service is not a default.       

(4) 

The weighted     average pay rate represents the cash interest payments collected on the bonds as a percentage of the bonds  average UPB for the preceding 12 months for the population of bonds at September 30, 2016.     

(5) 

Debt service coverage is calculated on a rolling 12-month basis using property level information as of the prior quarter-end for those bonds with must pay coupons that are collateralized by multi-family properties.       

(6) 

The weighted     average coupon and pay rate of the multifamily tax-exempt bonds and total bond portfolio excludes the population of subordinated cash flow bonds where non-payment of debt service is not a default.      

(7) 

Includes 10 bonds financed by TRS   agreement  s and accounted for as derivatives. These 10 bonds had a UPB of $  86  .1   million and a fair value of $  90.0   million and were subject to TRS   agreement  s with a notional amount of $  8  7  .5   million.  This amount also includes an additional   nine   bonds financed by TRS   agreement  s accounted for as a secured borrowing.  These bonds had a UPB of $  96  .3   million and a fair value of $  103.2   million and were subject to TRS   agreement  s with a notional amount of $  87.  4   million.       

(8) 

Amounts included within this table e  xclude   an investment in a performing multifamily tax-exempt bond that has   a UPB of $  12.3   million   as of September 30, 2016.  This bond has been excluded from this table because the   real estate partnership   has been consolidated by the Company for financial reporting purposes.       

(9) 

As of June 30, 2016, the Bond Portfolio contained 35 bonds   of which 29 multifamily tax-exempt bonds   were   collateralized by 22 affordable multifamily rental properties.     

The fair value of the Bond Portfolio as a percentage of its UPB improved from 102.4% as of June 30, 2016 to   104.9  % as of September 30, 2016.    T  he weighted     average debt service coverage ratio improved from    1  .07x   as of   June    3  0  , 2016 to   1.09  x   as of   September   30, 2016.     

Exposure of the Bond Portfolio to Increases in Market Yields and Capitalization Rates 

The   Bond Portfolio   is exposed to market risk, which is the potential for adverse changes in value resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates or credit spreads.        The fair value of the bonds is influenced both by the performance of the underlying real estate assets (i.e.,   as   a proxy for creditworthiness) and long  -  term tax-exempt interest rates and credit spreads (i.e., generally as long  -t  erm rates and/or credit spreads rise, bonds become less valuable). 

In   Table   2  , we   measure the Bond Portfolio s sensitivity to increases in market yields and terminal capitalization rates by measuring how its fair value would hypothetically change as a result of   a  n instantaneous   100 basis point increase in the market yield and terminal capitalization rate assumptions that were originally used to measure the fair value of our Bond Portfolio as reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  In estimating such impacts, we also assumed that expected future cash flows   and   the credit quality   associated with the Bond Portfolio remained constant relative to projections that were   assumed   in fair value measurements used to report carrying values in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   

4   

The fair value sensitivity of the Bond Portfolio is calculated using internal models that require standard assumptions regarding market yields and other inputs that are used to measure the fair value of such instruments for financial reporting purposes.  Valuation assumptions are derived based on the characteristics of the underlying structure of instruments in the Bond Portfolio and other factors.  Refer to   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 7,  Fair Value  for more information about our methods that are used to measure fair value. 

Table   2   displays   the change in fair value of the Bond Portfolio as measured on the last day of each period presented using   the   assumptions described above.

LIHTC    

In our LIHTC business line  ,     we primarily own and manage   limited partner (   LP   )     and   general partner (   GP   )   investments in affordable housing communities in the U.S.    In this regard, w  e provide asset management and administrative services to   a limited liability company formed   in 2015   by the Company and a commercial bank (   TC Fund I   )     that acquired   limited partnership   interests   either   directly or through fund investments   in   approximately   650 affordable properties  .  We also   acquired several direct real estate investments in connection with the formation of TC Fund I  .    Through this business line, we also have loan receivables from, and an option to purchase, a tax credit asset manager.    W  e have   ma  de   other guarantees   through this business line   to   some of our   institutional clients   related to the receipt of tax credits and the performance of the underlying assets  .         

TC Fund I 

As   consideration for providing asset management and administrative services to TC Fund I, the Company is entitled to an asset management fee of 2% per annum on the initial capital contribution of $211 million by an investor with whom the Company partnered to form TC Fund I.  This amount accrues quarterly in advance, bears interest at 6% per annum compounded annually and is to be paid solely from cash flows received by TC Fund I from its portfolio of   limited partnership   investments.  Asset management fees are generally payable to the Company by TC Fund I after payments are made by TC Fund I to: 1) repay any tax credit losses funded by the investor; 2) redeem any investor member voluntary loans; 3) to repay any mandatory loans made by the Company to fund investor tax credit losses; 4) to pay any expense loans; 5) to establish any required reserves; and 6) to pay any accrued guarantee fees.    By their nature, investments of TC Fund I are expected to break-even from an operating cash flow perspective.  In this regard, excess cash flows to limited partners are generated primarily from residual events that come at the end of the tax compliance period and are   generally   outside of the control of the Company in terms of if, and when, they occur. 

A  s of September 30, 2016, the   Company   wa  s contractually due $3.2   million for   asset management and administrative   services rendered   to TC Fund I   through such date.  However, such amount has not yet been recognized in the Company s financial statements   because it was assessed to not be reasonably assured of collection  .  The Company s   assessment in this case   considers various factors that include, but are not limited to, the length of time   until   the Company expects to receive payment and the priority of payment of such fees relative to other interests in TC Fund I.    The Company assesses   each reporting period   whether asset management fees that are legally due are reasonably assured of collection. 

In connection with the formation of TC Fund I, t  he Company has also provided a limited guarantee of tax credits that are expected to be generated by TC Fund I s portfolio of investments.  In consideration for providing   this   guarantee, the Company is contractually entitled to   receive   $4.2 million   in guarantee fees   from TC Fund I  .  The Company recognized a guarantee fee receivable for such amount in its financial statements on December 31, 2015.  This receivable bears interest at 6% per annum, compound  s   annually, and will be paid solely from cash flows received by TC Fund I from its portfolio of   limited partnership     investments.     

To cover certain costs associated with the organization of TC Fund I, the Company lent $5.3 million to TC Fund I upon its formation.  This loan legally accrues interest at 9.5% per annum  ,   compound  s   annually and will be repaid solely from cash flows that are received by TC Fund I from its portfolio of limited partnership interests.    As of September 30, 2016,   this loan, which had a carrying value of $  0.2   million, was on non  -  accrual status   given, among other factors, the timing and amount of cash flow projections for this loan and its payment priority in TC Fund I s waterfall  .    The   non-accrual status   of this loan is   re-assessed by the Company each reporting period.  

5   

Direct Real Estate Investments 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company own  ed     three   real estate investments that it acquired on December 31, 2015 in connection with the formation of TC Fund I.  These investments, which consisted of   three   99% limited partnership inter  ests, had a carrying value of $8.3   million at September 30, 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company also owned   a 1.0% general partnership interest in an entity that owns an affordable multifamily property that served as collateral for one of our bond investments.  The acquisition of such general partner interest resulted in the   consolidation   of   this partnership and, as a result, the Company recognized the   affordable multifamily property,   which had a carrying value of $14.5   million at September 30, 2016  . 

Interests in a Tax Credit Asset Manager 

In 2014, prior to the formation of TC Fund I, the Company sold substantially all of its LIHTC business to a tax credit asset manager.  As part of this transaction, the Company provided a subordinated loan and received an option to purchase the tax credit asset manager in the future. 

The UPB of   the subordinated   loan   to the tax credit asset manager   was $13.0 million as of September 30, 2016.  This loan is non-amortizing and has a maturity date of June 30, 2025.    This loan bears   interest at a base rate of 11% that is paid quarterly and contingent interest up to an additional 13%.  Since origination, the Company has received principal and interest payments of $6.3 million.    The receipt of such amounts are reported by us as a deferred gain in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets (or classified in  Other Liabilities ) since   the conveyance could not be treated as a sale for financial reporting purposes.         

The option price to acquire the tax credit asset manager is   $12.0 million  ,   subject to various purchase price adjustments.  The tax credit asset manager originates and manages debt and equity investments on behalf of third party investors and for its own account.  Our purchase option of the tax credit manager may be exercised between September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2024, though it may be accelerated for certain events. 

Other Guarantees 

Prior to the sale of substantially all of our tax credit equity business   in 2014  , we  syndicated  tax credits by forming LIHTC Funds that purchased directly or indirectly the limited partnership interests in multiple Lower Tier Property Partnerships (   LTPPs   ).      We raised capital from institutional investors, which comprised virtually all of the equity of the LIHTC Funds, and the LIHTC Funds used this capital, and sometimes interim debt financing, to purchase the limited partner interests in the LTPPs.      We were the general partner of, and managed, the LIHTC Funds, and usually retained an interest of between 0.01% and 1.0% in each of them.      The remaining 99.0% to 99.99% interest in each LIHTC Fund was typically held by one or more large financial institutions. 

We provided two general types of guarantees in connection with these transactions: (1) LIHTC Fund level guarantees where the Company, directly and indirectly, guaranteed the investors      return on investment (   Guaranteed Funds   ); and (2) individual indemnifications to specific investors in non-guaranteed LIHTC Funds related to the performance of specific   LTPPs  .       Because the LTPPs and the LIHTC Funds (as well as any intermediate entities) are pass-through entities for federal income tax purposes, the equity owners of the LIHTC Funds receive the tax benefit of the credits generated by the Lower Tier Property Partnerships.   In order for the investors in the Guaranteed Funds to benefit from low-income housing tax credits, the LTPPs in which these entities invest must operate affordable housing properties in compliance with a number of requirements in the Code and the regulations under it.  Failure to comply continuously with these requirements throughout a 15-year recapture period could result in loss of the right to those low-income housing tax credits, including recapture of credits that were already taken, potentially creating a liability under our guarantees.  The execution of these guarantees caused the Company to consolidate the Guaranteed Funds for financial reporting purposes. 

As c  onsideration for providing these guarantees, the Company received upfront guarantees fees of $  28.9   million   that were initially deferred for financial reporting purposes and that are amortized into earnings over the contractual life of such obligations.  However,   because the Guaranteed Funds have been consolidated by the Company for reporting purposes, certain fees and other payments received from such consolidated entities are not classified as revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations but rather are reflected as income that is allocated to us from consolidated funds and ventures. 

When the Company sold its tax credit equity business in 2014 to   a tax credit asset manager, it agreed to indemnify the tax credit asset manager   from investor claims related to those guarantees and, therefore, we continue to be obligated on our guarantees to investors in these funds.       

Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 7,  Fair Value  for more information about the fair value measurement of certain of our contractual rights and obligations that we maintain through our LIHTC business line.

Diluted common shareholders  equity   (   Book Value   )   per share increased to $  21.3  4   at   September   30, 2016, which represents a  n     increase of   8.  8  %  , or $  1.7  2   per share   of   B  ook   V  alue  ,   compared to what we reported   a  t     June    3  0  ,    2016.    Most of this growth, or $1.  69   per share, was attributable to comprehensive income from core operations and bond valuations while the balance, or $0.03 per share, was driven by purchases of common shares made by the Company at prices below its Book Value per share.

Net interest income reported for the three months ended   September   30, 2016   increased   compared to that reported for the three months ended   September   30, 2015 primarily   due to an increase in the UPB of solar loans that were directly   invested in   by the Company   in 2016  . 

Net interest income reported for the   nine   months   ended   September    3  0  , 201  6   declined compared to that reported for the   nine   months   ended   September     3  0  , 201  5   primarily as a result of   (i)   the sale or redemption of certain bond holdings   and   (ii)     the full redemption of a bridge loan in the second quarter of 2015  .    This     decline   was partially offset by   an increase in interest income that was driven by an increase in the UPB of solar loans that were directly   invested in   by the Company in 2016  .             

Fee and Other Income  

Fee and Other Income includes income on our preferred stock investment, asset management fees and reimbursements as well as other miscellaneous income.

Fee and other income   reported for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 declined compared to that reported for the three months     ended   September   30, 2015   primarily as a result of   the redemption of the Company s investment in preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2015.        This decline was partially offset by a  n   increase in asset management fees and reimbursements that was primarily   attributable to     $0.  3   million of   property management   fees   earned by   IHS PM and   $0.  3   million in reimbursements that w  ere   rec  ognized   in the   third   quarter of 2016 from our Solar Joint Venture.             

Fee and other income   reported for the   nine   months   ended   September    3  0  , 201  6     declined   compared to that reported for the   nine   months   ended   September    3  0  , 201  5     primarily as a result of   the redemption of the Company s investment in preferred stock   in   the fourth quarter of 2015.        This decline was partially offset by a  n   increase in asset management fees and reimbursements that was driven primarily by   $  1.2   million   of property management fees earned by   IHS PM and   $0.  8   million in reimbursements   rec  ognized     from our Solar Joint Venture   during the   nine   months   ended   2016  .

(   MFH   ) subordinate  d   debt  , which   was restructured during the second quarter of 2015.    The reported decline in   other interest expense   was also partially attributable to   the   paydown of certain debt outstanding that was used to fund   the Company s investment in preferred stock  , which was redeemed in full in   the fourth quarter of 2015.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Liquidity 

Our principal sources of liquidity include  :     (1)   cash and cash equivalents  ; (2)   cash flows from   operating   activities; and (3) cash flows from   investing activities.   

Summary of Cash Flows 

At   September    3  0  , 201  6   and   December   31, 201  5  , we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $  21.7   million and $  21.8   million, respectively, and   we believe   that cash generated from   operating and   investing activities, along with available cash and cash equivalents will be   sufficient to   fund our normal operating needs and   meet our obligations as they become due. 

D  uring periods presented in this Report, we consolidated certain funds and ventures for financial reporting purposes and, therefore, cash flow activities for such funds and ventures were reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.    In this regard, c  ash balances of CFVs are classified as  Restricted cash  in our Consolidated Balance Sheets because the Company does not have legal   title to such   balances. 

Table 1  6   provides a consolidated view of the change in cash and cash equivalents of the Company for the periods presented, though changes in such balances that are attributable to CFVs are separately identified in such disclosure.     

C  hanges in net cash flows that are reported in Tables 1  7  ,    1  8   and 1  9   are   ex  clusive of changes in restricted cash balances of CFVs. 

Table   1  6  :  Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents

Operating   A  ctivities 

Table 1  7   provides information about net cash flows   provided by, or used in,   operating activities for the   periods presented.        C  ash flows from operating activities include, but   are   not limited to, interest income on our investments and asset management fees.    

Table 1  7  :  Net Cash Flows   Associated With   Operating Activities 

Net cash flows provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $1  2.2   million compared to that reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase was primarily attributable to distributions from investments in partnerships, a decline in originations of loans held for sale and an increase in asset management fees received. 

During the first nine months of 2016, we received $7.4 million of distributions from investments in partnerships while we received no distributions from such investments in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  These distributions included $2.6 million that we received from the sale of real estate that was owned by a partnership in which the Company held a 50% limited partner interest and $4.1 million that we received in connection with our equity investment in the Solar Joint Venture.  

Through the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has not funded any loans held for sale.  As a result, net cash flows used in such operating activities have declined.   

The Company experienced an increase in asset management fees and reimbursements received of $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to amounts received during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase   was driven primarily by additional fees of $1.2 million relating to IHS PM and an additional $1.0 million in reimbursements from our Solar Joint Venture that were received during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Increases in cash flows provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease in preferred stock dividends.  This decline is attributable to the redemption of the Company s investment in preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2015.   

The Company also experienced a $1.4 million increase in cash used in operating activities attributable to salaries and benefits.  This increase was primarily a result of higher employee incentive compensation paid by the Company in the first quarter of 2016, as well as the hiring of new employees associated with our Energy Capital and Other Investment  s   business line.

Investing   A  ctivities 

Table   1  8   provides information about   net   c  ash   f  lows   used in, or   provided by,   investing activities for the   periods presented.        C  ash flows from investing activities include, but are not limited to, principal payments and sales proceeds received on bonds and proceeds from the sale of real estate and other investments.     

Table   1  8  :  Net Cash Flows   Associated With   Investing Activities 

Net cash flows   provided by   investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016   de  creased by $5  1.3   million compared to that reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease was primarily attributable to originations of loans held for investment, changes in restricted cash and proceeds from the sale of real estate, which were partially offset by a decline in cash used for investments in property partnerships and real estate. 

Through the first nine months of 2016, the Company used $41.1 million of cash for originations of loans held for investment while the Company only used $0.4 million for such assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

The Company received proceeds from the sale of real estate and other investments of $2  7.0   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The decline in proceeds received is due   to   less sales activity in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015  .   

Through the first nine months of 2016, the Company s balance of restricted cash increased $18.8 million.  This increase was primarily attributable to cash collateral that was pledged during the third quarter of 2016 in connection with execution of a total return swap.      

Decreases in cash flows provided by investing activities were partially offset by a $23.6 million decrease in cash flows used in investments in property partnerships and real estate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to amounts used during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease was primarily attributable to a $25.0 million investment in our Solar Joint Venture during the third quarter of 2015.   

Financing   A  ctivities 

Table     19   provides information about net cash flows   provided by  , or us  ed in,   financing activities for the   periods presented.   

Table   19  :  Net Cash Flows   Associated With   Financing Activities 

Net cash flows used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016   de  creased by $11.7 million compared to that reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    This   de  crease was primarily due to $37.2 million of cash used for repayment of borrowings during the first nine months of 2015 compared to   only   $14.8 million   that was   used   for the same purpose   during the   first nine months of   2016.  

20   

De  creases in cash flows used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were partially offset by a $9.0 million decrease in proceeds   received   from borrowing   activity  .        This   decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in proceeds generated from total return swap financing arrangements entered into by the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the amount of cash generated by the Company from such purposes during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Additionally, cash used by the Company for the purchase of treasury stock increased by $1.2 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to that reported for the first nine months of 2015. 

Capital Resources 

Our debt obligations primarily include liabilities that we recognized in connection with the execution of TRS   agreement  s that we use to finance a portion of our investments in bonds, as well as subordinated debentures and notes payable that were not incurred for purposes other   than   to finance our interest  -  bearing assets.  Each of the major types of our debt obligations is further discussed below. 

Table   2  0     summarizes t  he carrying values and weighted   average   effective   interest rates of the Company s debt obligations that were outstanding at   September     3  0  , 201  6  .  See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements        Note   5  ,  Debt,  for more information   about these contractual commitments  . 

Table   2  0  :  Asset Related Debt and Other Debt 

(1) 

Asset related debt is debt that finances interest-bearing assets.  The interest expense from this debt is included in  Net interest income  on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.       

(2) 

Other debt is debt that does not finance interest-bearing assets.  The interest expense from this debt is included in  Interest expense  under  Operating and other expenses  on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.     

(3) 

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 1  3  ,  Consolidated Funds and Ventures,  for more information.     

Notes Payable and Other Debt   Bond Related 

These debt obligations pertain to bonds that are classified as available-for-sale and that were financed by the Company through   TRS   agreement  s  .  See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   Note   5  ,  Debt,  for more information.   

Notes Payable and Other Debt   Non-Bond Related 

At   September    3  0  , 201  6  , this debt obligation relates primarily to amounts recognized by the Company in connection with a conveyance of solar loans to the Solar Joint Venture.  See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   Note   5  ,  Debt,  for more information.   

21   

Subordinated debt 

At   September    3  0  , 201  6  , the Company had subordinate  d   debt   with a   UPB     of   $  121.2   million   and   carrying value of $  130.0   million  .      The     w  eighted     average   yield   of   this   debt was   3.3  %.  The carrying value   of   this   debt   includes $  11.5   million of net   premiums   that   will amortize   into net interest income   as a reduction to debt expense over the life of the debt  .    These   impacts will be   offset by   $  2.7   million   of unamortized debt issuance costs that will amortize as an increase to   interest   expense over the remaining life of the debt.   

Notes payable and other   debt 

At   September   30, 2016, the Company had notes payable and other debt with a UPB of $  13.8   million.  See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 5,  Debt,  for more information.

Other Capital Resources 

Common   Shares 

On December 14, 2015, the Board authorized a 2016 share repurchase program (   2016 Plan   ) for up to   6  00,000   shares and on December 31, 2015, the Company adopted a Rule 10b5-1 Plan implementing the Board s authorization.    During the   third   quarter of 2016, the Company repurchased   64,762   shares at an average price of $  18.38  .    Between   October   1, 2016 and   November     2  , 2016, we repurchased   92,052   shares at an average price   of $  18.17  .        As of   November     2  , 201  6, the Company had repurchased   564,022   mi  llion shares at an average of $  16.68   since the   inception of the   2016 P  lan  .    Effective at the filing of this Report and until mod  ified by further action by the B  oard  , t  he maximum price at which management is authorized to purchase shares is $  21.34   per share.   

Dividend Policy 

The Board   makes determinations regarding dividends based on management s recommendation, which is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including our common shareholders  equity, business prospects and available cash.  We do not expect to pay a   dividend for the foreseeable future.  

22   

Tax   Benefits Rights Agreement  

Effective    M  ay 5, 2015, the Company adopted a   Tax Benefits Rights Agreement (   Rights Plan   )   designed to help preserve the Company s   net operating losses (   NOLs   )  .  In connection with adopting the Rights Plan, the Company declared a distribution of one right per common share to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2015.  The rights do not trade apart from the current common shares until the distribution date, as defined in the Rights Plan.  Under the Rights Plan,   the acquisition by an investor (or group of related investors) of   greater than a 4.9% stake in the Company,   could result in   all existing shareholders other than the new 4.9% holder   having the right   to acquire new shares for a nominal cost, thereby significantly diluting the ownership interest of the acquiring person.  The Rights Plan runs for a period of five years, or until the Board determines the plan is no longer required, whichever comes first.   

As of     September    3  0  , 2016, there was one shareholder whose ownership interest in the Company exceeded 4.9% (5.5%).    T  his shareholder s ownership stake grew to exceed the 4.9% threshold as a result of the Company   s   repurchase   of   its own shares   and, as a result, did not trigger a distribution of rights under the Rights Plan  .

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements is based on the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (   GAAP   ), which requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classification of the amounts in our consolidated financial statements.  These estimates and assumptions require us to make difficult, complex and subjective judgments involving matters that are inherently uncertain.  We base our accounting estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on judgments that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances known to us at the time.      Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.  We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed those policies with our Audit Committee. 

We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions.  Management has discussed any significant changes in judgments and assumptions in applying our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.  See  Risk Factors  in our 2015 Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with the need for management to make judgments and estimates in applying our accounting policies and methods.  We have identified three of our accounting policies as critical because they involve significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition.  These policies govern: 

Fair value measurement of our investments in bonds     

Consolidation of funds and ventures; and      

Income taxes.     

See    M  anagement s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    in our 2015 Form 10-K for a discussion of these critical accounting   policies   and estimates.

Note 1       S  ummary of Significant Accounting Policies    

O  rganization 

MMA Capital Management, LLC, the registrant, was organized in 1996 as a Delaware limited liability company.  Unless the context otherwise requires, and when used in this Report, the    Company,       MMA,       we,       our    or    us    refers to MMA Capital Management, LLC and its subsidiaries. 

The Company partners with institutional capital to create and manage investments in affordable housing and renewable energy.    We invest for   our own account and   co-invest with our institutional capital partners.  We derive revenue from returns on our investments as well as asset management, performance and other fees from the investments  ,     funds and ventures we manage.  

The Company operates through three reportable segments  . 

United States (   U.S.   )   Operations   consists of three business lines: Leveraged Bonds,   Low Income Housing Tax Credit (   LIHTC   )   and Energy Capital and Other Investments (previously referred to as  Other Investments and Obligations  in the Company s 2015 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q).     In our Leveraged Bonds business line, we primarily own and manage bonds   for our own account   that finance affordable housing and infrastructure in the U.S  .    In our LIHTC business line, we primarily own and manage limited partner (   LP   ) and general partner (   GP   ) investments in affordable housing communities in the U.S.     In our   Energy Capital and Other Investments business line, our wholly owned subsidiary MMA Energy Capital (   MEC   )   provides debt capital   to   develop,   build and operate   renewable energy systems.  We   originate solar loans directly and   through a joint venture that we have with an alternative asset manager (our    Solar Joint Venture   )  .        In this business line, w  e     also   manage   legacy equity investments in real estate, solar assets and an investment in land  .    

International Operations     is managed through our wholly owned subsidiary, International Housing Solutions   S.  r.l.   (   IHS   ).  IHS s strategy is to raise, invest in and manage private real estate funds that invest in residential real estate.  IHS currently manages three funds: the South Africa Workforce Housing Fund (   SAWHF   ), which is a multi-investor fund and is fully invested; International Housing Solutions Residential Partners Partnership (   IHS Residential Partners   ), which is a single-investor fund targeted at the emerging middle class in South Africa; and IHS Fund II (   IHS Fund II   ), which is a multi-investor funds targeting investments in affordable housing, including green housing projects, within South Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa.  MMA also owns a 60% interest in IHS Property Management Proprietary Limited (   IHS PM   ), which provides property management services to the properties of IHS-managed funds. 

Corporate Operations     is responsible for   support  ing     accounting, reporting, compliance and financial planning   and   analysis services. 

B  asis of Presentation     

The accompanying consolidated financial statements   have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (   GAAP   ) in the U.S.    To conform to our current period presentation, we have reclassified certain amounts reported in our prior periods  consolidated financial statements.   

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and of entities that are considered to be variable interest entities (   VIEs   ) in which the Company is the primary beneficiary, as well as those entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest, including wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  Equity investments in unconsolidated entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over   the operations of the entity, but is not considered the primary beneficiary, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.   

The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as of, and for the three months and   nine   months ended   September   30 2016, should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (   2015 Form 10-K   ).  

The operating results presented for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year.   

The Company evaluates subsequent events through the date of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (   SEC   ).   

33   

U  se of   E  stimates  

The   preparation of the Company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported   amounts   of assets and liabilities, commitments and contingencies, and revenues and expenses.  Management has made significant estimates in certain areas, including the determination of fair values for bonds, derivative instruments, guarantee obligations, and certain assets and liabilities of CFVs.  Management has also made significant estimates in the determination of impairment on bonds and real estate investments.  Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.  

P  rior Period Correction of an Immaterial Error  

In the first quarter of 2016, the Company determined that, in connection with two bond investments that were acquired in 2006 and 2007, it had understated the recognition of interest income and had overstated the recognition of unrealized holding gains on such investments in other comprehensive income by an equal and offsetting amount.  This financial statement error, which had no impact on total common shareholders  equity or diluted common shareholders  equity per share, was attributable to the   method used by the   Company to reduce the reported balance of investment-related cost basis adjustments into interest income.  The method   that was   used in this case was determined not to be compliant with GAAP.  

We assessed the materiality of the identified error on our financial statements for prior periods in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (   SAB   ) No. 99,    Materiality,    which is codified in Accounting Standards Codification (   ASC   ) 250,    Presentation of Financial Statements  ,  and concluded it was not material to any prior annual or interim periods.  However, the aggregate amount of the prior period corrections of $7.2 million if corrected in the current period would be material to our projected annual results of consolidated operations.  Consequently, in accordance with ASC 250 (specifically SAB No. 108,    Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements   ), we have corrected these errors for all prior years and interim periods presented by revising the consolidated financial statements and other financial information included herein.  Periods not presented herein will be revised, as applicable, in future filings. 

The effects of the revisions on our Consolidated Balance Sheet were as follows:

N  ew Accounting Guidance  

Accounting for Consolidation  

Effective January 1, 2016, we prospectively adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (   FASB   ) regarding consolidation of legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability companies and securitization structures.  The guidance removed the specialized consolidation model surrounding limited partnerships and similar entities and amended the requirements that such entities must meet to qualify as voting interest entities.  In addition, the guidance eliminated certain of the conditions for evaluating whether fees paid to a decision maker or service provider represented a variable interest.  The adoption of this guidance resulted in the Company expanding disclosures for interests we have in various entities that are considered to be variable interest entities; however, it did not impact the number of entities consolidated by the Company.    

Accounting for Financial Instruments  

In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (   ASU   ) No. 2016-01,    Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10):  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.     This guidance amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.  Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (i) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (ii) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.  This new guidance, which is effective for us on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted, also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.  We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,    Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments Improvements.     This guidance is intended to reduce the complexity of U.S. GAAP by decreasing the number of credit impairment models that entities use to account for debt instruments.  This guidance adds to U.S. GAAP an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.  This new guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted.    We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 

35   

Accounting for Leases  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,    Leases (Topic 842).     This guidance introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet, as well as aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in ASC 606, the FASB s new revenue recognition standard.  This new guidance, which is effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, also requires lessors to increase the transparency of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure.

N  ote   2 B  onds Available-For-Sale 

The   Company s     investments in   bond  s     that are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (as a component of Bonds available-for-sale)     are   comprised primarily of   multifamily tax-exempt   bonds, but also include other real estate related bond investments.   

M  ultifamily tax-exempt   bonds are issued by state and local governments or their agencies or authorities to finance multifamily rental   housing  .      Generally,   the only source of   security   on these bonds is either a first mortgage or a subordinate mortgage on the underlying properties.   

The Company s investments in other real estate related bonds include municipal bonds that   were   issued to finance the development of community infrastructure that supports   a    mixed  -  use commercial development and are secured by incremental tax revenues generated from the   development  .  Investments in other real estate related bonds also include senior investments in a trust collateralized by a pool of tax-exempt municipal bonds that finance a variety of non-profit projects such as   healthcare and educational   facilities, as well as a subordinated investment in a collateralized mortgage backed security that finances multifamily housing.   

The weighted     average pay rate on the Company s bond portfolio was   5.8  %   and   5.4%   at   September   30, 2016 and December    3  1  ,   2015,     respectively  .  Weighted     average pay rate represents the cash interest payments collected on the bonds as a percentage of the bonds  average   unpaid principal balance (   UPB   )   for the preceding 12 months for the population of bonds at   September   30, 2016 and December    3  1, 2015  , respectively.

The following tables provide information about the UPB, amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and fair value (   FV   ) associated with the Company s investments in bonds that are classified as available-for-sale: 

(1) 

Consists of the UPB, unamortized premiums, discounts and other cost basis adjustments, as well as other-than-temporary impairments (   OTTI   ) recognized in earnings.      

See Note   7  ,  Fair Value  ,    which describes factors   that   contribut  ed   to the   $  39.0     million decrease in the reported   fair value of the   Company s bond   portfolio for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016  .   

M  aturity 

Principal payments on   the Company s investments in   bonds are based on   contractual terms that are set   forth in   the contractual   documents   governing such investments  .  If principal   payments are not required to be made prior to   the   contractual maturity of a   bond  ,     its UPB   is required to be paid in a lump sum payment at   contractual   maturity or at such earlier time as may be provided under the   governing   documents.  At   September     3  0  , 201  6  ,    the   majority of the   Company   s     bonds amortiz  e     on a scheduled basis a  nd have   stated maturity dates between   September 2017 and June 2056  .        The Company also had   five   non-amortizing   bonds with principal due in full between November 2044 and August 2048 (the total cost basis and fair v  alue of these bonds were   $  14.2     million and   $  25.4   million, respectively, at   September    3  0  , 2016).   

B  onds with Prepayment Features     

The     contractual terms of substantially all of the Company s investments in bonds include provisions that permit   such instruments   to be prepaid at par after a specified date that is prior to the  ir   stated maturity date.  The following table provides information about the UPB, amortized cost and fair value of the Company s investments in bonds   that were prepayable at par at   September    3  0  , 201  6  , as well as stratifies such information for the remainder of the Company s investments based upon the periods in which such instruments become     prepayable at par: 

37

N  on-Accrual Bonds  

The fair value of the Company s investments in bonds that were on non-accrual status was $  28.7   million and   $43.3   million at   September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  During the period in which such bonds were on non-accrual status, the Company recognized interest income on a cash basis of   $  0.1   million and   $0.  4   million for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $  0.6   million and   $1.  2   million for the   nine   mon  ths   ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Interest income not recognized during the period in which these investments in bonds were on non-accrual status was   $  0.4   million for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015,   and   $  1.3   million for the   nine   months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015  .   

During the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016, bonds that were on non-accrual status that had a fair value   of   $  22.9   million   at December 31, 2015 were sold or redeemed.  No bonds on non-accrual were sold or redeemed during the three months ended   September   30, 2016.

I  nvestments in U.S. Real Estate Partnerships 

At   September    3  0  , 201  6  ,    $  16.5   million of the reported   carrying value     pertains to an equity investment made by   the Company     in a real estate venture that was formed during the fourth quarter of 2014.  The Company made an initial contribution of   $8.8   million  , which   represent  ed     80%   of the real estate venture s initial capital.  The Company has rights to a preferred return on its capital contribution, as well as rights to share in excess cash flows   of the real estate venture.  As this entity was determined not to be a VIE, t  he Company accounts for this investment   using the   equity   method of accounting  .   

At   September    3  0  , 201  6  , $  6.1   million   of the reported carrying value pertains to an equity investment that   represents a   33%     ownership   interest in a partnership that was formed to take a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on land that was collateral for a loan held by the Company.    Through the governing operating agreement, the Company is obligated to make additional capital contributions representing its proportionate amount of the partnership's obligations as they become due.  This contractual commitment does not have a defined contribution limit.  While this entity was determined to be a VIE, the   Company   was deemed not to be its primary beneficiary.  Therefore, the Company did not consolidate this entity and   accounts for   this   investment   using the equity method of accounting  .   

At   September   30,   2016,   $  5.0   million of the reported   carrying value pertains to equity investments acquired by a wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant, MuniMae TEI Holdings, LLC (   TEI   ), during the fourth quarter of 2015.  While these entities are determined to be VIEs, the Company was not deemed to be its primary beneficiary.  Therefore, t  he Company   did not consolidate these entities and accounts for its investments in them using   the equity method of accounting.       

At   September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,   four   and   five   of   the U.S. real estate partnerships in which we have investments were determined to be VIEs  , respectively  .  The carrying value of the equity investments in   these   partnerships was   $  11.2   million and   $13.4   million at   September    3  0  , 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Other than as noted above, we are not contractually obligated to commit further capital to these investments.  Our maximum exposure to loss due to our involvement with these VIEs was   $  11.2   million and   $20.3   million as of   September    3  0  , 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Because we are unable to quantify the maximum amount of additional capital contributions that we may be required to fund in the future associated with our proportionate share of one of the VIEs, we measure our maximum exposure to loss based upon the carrying value of the aforementioned investments and loan receivable.

I  nvestments in IHS-Managed Funds  

At   September   30, 2016  , the Company held equity co-investments in three IHS-managed funds (SAWHF, IHS Residential Partners and IHS Fund II)   that   rang  e     from   a    1.8%   to a   4.25%   ownership   interest in such funds  .  IHS provides asset management services to each of these investment vehicles in return for asset management fees.  For each investment vehicle, IHS also has rights to investment returns on its equity co-investment as well as   rights to an allocation of profits from such funds (often referred to as  carried interest ),   which   are   contingent upon the investment returns generated by each investment vehicle.   

At   September     3  0  , 201  6  , the carrying   value   of the Company s   equity   investment in SAWHF  ,   IHS Residential Partners   and IHS Fund II   was   $  1.2   million,   $  2.0   million     and   $  0.2   million,   respective  ly.   

As the SAWHF and IHS Fund II entities were determined not to be VIEs, the Company accounts for these investments using the equity method of accounting.   

While IHS Residential Partners was determined to be a VIE, this entity was not consolidated for reporting purposes as the Company was deemed not to be its primary beneficiary.  As a   result, the Company accounts for this investment using the equity method of accounting.  The Company does not expect to make additional capital contributions to Residential Partners I   and, as a result, the Company believe  s   that its risk of loss is limited to     i  ts investment balance of $2.0 milli  o  n.  However,   through the governing shareholder agreement, IHS could be required to commit up to   180   million rand   as capital contributions   to such fund.  In this regard, our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement in this VIE   is approximately   $  13.1   million and   $11.7   million as   of   September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, based upon foreign currency exchange rates as of such reporting dates.

See Note 13,  Consolidated Funds and Ventures,  for more information.     

L  oans Held For Investment   ( HFI )  

The Company s loans that are HFI primarily include solar loans.    We report the carrying value of   HFI   loans at their UPB, net of unamortized premiums, discounts and other cost basis adjustments and related allowance for loan losses  .  However, such loans   are reported at fair value to the extent the Company has elected the fair value option for such instruments     and, as a result, such assets are subsequently   measured on a fair value basis   in our Consolidated Statement of Operations as a component of  Net gains on derivatives, loans, other assets and extinguishment of liabilities.   

The   following table   provides information about   the amortized cost and allowance for loan losses   that were recognized in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets related to   loans   tha  t    it   classified as HFI: 

At   September 30, 2016 and   December 31,   2015  ,    HFI   loans had an UPB of   $50.9   million and   $13.2   million, respectively, as well as   deferred fees and other basis adjustments of   $7.6   million and   $4.5   million, respectively.   

At   September 30, 2016, the Company had six solar loans with a   UPB of   $44.1   million that   are classified as held for investment but for which the fair value option (   FVO   ) was elected to minimize certain operational challenges associated with accounting for these loans.       

At     September 30, 2016 and   December 31,   2015  ,    of the remaining HFI loans, impaired loans   had a UPB   of   $6.4   million and $1.1   million  , respectively,   and were not accruing   interest.    We report   impairment on HFI loans as  Other expenses  in our   Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

The   carrying value for HFI loans on non-accrual   status was   $0.5   million and     $0.3   million at   September 30, 2016 and   December 31,   2015, respectively.  The loan that the Company made to TC Fund I on December 31, 2015 is included among this population of loans.  

At     September 30, 2016 and   December 31,   2015  , no   HFI   loans that were 90 days or more past due   in scheduled   principal or interest   payments were still accruing interest. 

Loans Held For Sale ( HFS ) 

We report the carrying value of HFS loans at the lower of cost or fair value   with     the excess of the loan s cost over its fair value recognized as a valuation allowance within    Net gains on derivatives, loans, other assets and extinguishment of liabilities  in our   Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

42   

The cost basis for HFS loans   was   $6.0   million and   $12.4   million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, with a carrying value of zero and $6.4 million   at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company redesignated three solar loans with a carrying   value of $2.3 million   from HFS to HFI.  However, because the Company elected the fair value option for these loans upon their origination, such assets are subsequently measured on a fair value basis through earnings.  At December 31, 2015, there were no solar loans that were 90 days or more past due and none of these have since been placed on non-accrual.         

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not recognize any lower of cost or market adjustments.

A  sset Related Debt  

Notes Payable and Other Debt   Bond Related 

These debt obligations pertain to bonds that are classified as available-for-sale and that were financed by the Company through   total return swap (   TRS   )   agreements  .    In   such transactions, the Company convey  s   its interest in bonds to a counterparty in exchange for cash consideration while simultaneously executing   TRS   agreement  s   with the same counterparty for purposes of retaining the economic risks and returns of such investments.  The conveyance of the Company s interest in bonds was treated for reporting purposes as a secured borrowing while   TRS   agreement  s   that were executed simultaneously with such conveyance did not receive financial statement recognition since such derivative instruments caused the conveyance of the Company s interest in these bonds not to qualify for sale accounting treatment.   

At   September   30, 2016, u  nder the terms of   these TRS   agreement  s  , the counterparty is required to pay the Company an amount equal to the interest payments received on the underlying bonds (UPB of   $  83.2   million with a weighted     average pay rate of   6.4  %   at   September    3  0  , 201  6  ).  The Company is required to pay the counterparty a rate of Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (   SIFMA   ) 7-day municipal swap index plus a spread on the   TRS   agreement  s   (notional amount of   $  87.4   million with a weighted     average pay rate of   2.2  %   at   September    3  0  , 201  6  ).

At   September     3  0  , 201  6  , notes payable and other debt   non-bond related consisted primarily of the debt obligation that the Company recognized in connection with a conveyance of solar loans to the Solar Joint Venture during the third quarter of 2015 that did not qualify for sale accounting treatment.   

Interest expense   on notes payable and other debt   non-bond related totaled   $  0.2   million   and   $0.  3   million   for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015,   respectively,   and   $  0.7   million   and   $0.  6   million   for   the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  .

O  ther Debt  

Subordinated   Debt 

The table below provides   information about   the   key terms of the subordinate  d   debt   that was   issued by   the Company s wholly owned subsidiaries   MMA Financial  ,   Inc.   (   MFI   )     and MMA   Financial Holdings, Inc. (   MFH   )   and   that was outstanding   at   September    3  0  , 201  6  : 

Interest expense on the subordinate  d   debt totaled   $1.1   million and   $  0  .9   million for the   three months   ended   September    3  0  , 201  6   and 201  5  ,    respectively, and   $  3.2   million and   $  5.0   million for the   nine   months ended     September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  . 

Notes Payable and Other   Debt 

This debt   was   primarily   recognized in connection with the conveyance of a bond to a buyer with whom the Company concurrently executed a TRS.  In this case, the transfer of the bond did not qualify as a sale and, as a result, the proceeds received from the buyer were recognized as a debt obligation.  The bond was issued by a partnership that owns   an affordable multifamily property   and   that was consolidated by   the Company in the second quarter of 2016.  See Note 13,  Consolidated Funds and Ventures,  for   more   information. 

L  etters of Credit  

The   Company had   no   letters of credit   outstanding at   September   30, 2016 and December    3  1  , 2015. 

N  ote   6   D  erivative Instruments  

The Company uses derivative instruments for various purposes.  Pay-fixed interest rate swaps, interest rate basis swaps and interest rate caps are used to manage interest rate risk.  TRS agreements are used by the Company to obtain, or retain, the economic risks and rewards associated with tax exempt municipal bonds.  Additionally, the Company holds one warrant that it received as partial consideration in connection with a renewable energy financing transaction.          

Derivative instruments that are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are measured on a fair value basis.  Because the Company does not designate any of its derivative instruments as fair value or cash flow hedges, c  hanges   in fair value of such instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of  Net gains on   derivatives  ,   loans and other assets.     Derivative assets are   presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of    Other assets  and derivative liabilities are   presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of    Other liabilities.    

The   following   table   provides information about the carrying value of   the Company s derivative   instruments: 

46   

The following table   provides information about the   notional amounts   of the Company s derivative instruments: 

(1) 

Notional amount represents the quotient derived by dividing the warrant coverage by the share calculation price  .     

The following table provides information about the net gains (losses) that were recognized by the Company in connection with its derivative instruments:       

(1) 

The cash paid and received on TRS agreements that were reported as derivative instruments is settled on a net basis and recorded through  Net gains on derivatives, loans and other assets  on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Net cash received was   $1.0   million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Net cash received was   $3.2   million and   $3.0   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.        

(2) 

The cash paid and received on the interest rate swap is settled on a net basis and recorded through  Net gains on derivatives, loans and other assets  on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Net cash paid was   $0.1   million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Net cash paid was   $0.2   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.       

On October 14, 2016, we terminated two, and downsized one, pay London Interbank Offer Rate (   LIBOR   )-receive SIFMA basis swaps that had a combined notional balance   of   $70.0   million.  Additionally, the Company executed   two   pay-fixed interest swaps that had a combined notional amount of   $105.0   million for purposes of synthetically fixing our cost of funding associated with a portion of outstanding TRS that is indexed to SIFMA.  We also executed a pay SIFMA-receive LIBOR basis swap, a pay fixed-receive SIFMA  

47   

interest rate swap and a   LIBOR   interest rate cap to collectively hedge   $70.0   million (in notional   terms) of LIBOR-based exposure associated with subordinated debt of the Company. 

N  ote     7     F  air Value     

We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.  Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are presented in the first table below in this Note.  From time to time, we may be required to measure at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis such as certain loans held for investment or investments in partnerships.  These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 

F  air Value Hierarchy     

The Company measures the fair value of its assets and liabilities based upon their contractual terms and using relevant market information.  A   description   of the methods used by the Company to measure fair value is provided below.  Fair value measurements are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and often require the Company to make significant judgments.  Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the Company s measurement of fair value.   

GAAP   establishes a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes inputs into the valuation techniques used to measure fair value.    Fair value measurements associated with assets and liabilities are categorized into one of the following levels of the hierarchy based upon how observable the valuation inputs are that are used in such measurements. 

Level 1:    Valuation is based upon q  uoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.     

Level 2:    Valuation is based upon q  uoted prices for similar     instruments in active markets  ,   quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs or significant value drivers are observable in active markets.     

Level 3:  Valuation   is generated   from techniques   that use   significant   assumptions that   are   not   observable   in the market  .    These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.     

48   

R  ecurring Changes in Fair Value  

The following tables present the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis   by instrument type and   based upon the level of the fair value hierarchy within which fair value measurements of such assets and liabilities are categorized  .       

C  hanges in Fair Value Levels  

We monitor the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy and transfer between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 accordingly.  Observable market data includes, but is not limited to, quoted prices and market transactions.  Changes in economic conditions or market liquidity generally will drive changes in availability of observable market data.  Changes in availability of observable market data, which also may result in changing the valuation technique used, are generally the cause of transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.  

For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no individually significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2, or between Levels 2 and 3. 

Changes in fair value of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and that are categorized as Level 3   within the fair value hierarchy are attributed in the following table to identified activities that occurred during the three months ended   September   30, 2016:

Fair Value Measurements of Instruments That Are Classified as Level 3 

The   tables   that follow provide quantitative information about the valuation techniques and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of substantially all of our Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for which we use an internal model to measure fair value.  The significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 assets and liabilities that are valued using dealer pricing are not included in the table, as the specific inputs applied are not provided by the dealer.  

52   

(1) 

Unobservable inputs reflect   information that is not based upon independent sources that are readily available.  These inputs are based upon assumptions and internally generated data made by the Company, which may include significant judgment that has been developed based upon available information from third party sources or dealers about what a market participant would use in valuing the asset  .     

(2) 

Weighted averages are calculated using outstanding UPB for cash instruments, such as loans and securities, and notional amounts for derivative instruments.

(2) 

Weighted averages are calculated using outstanding UPB for cash instruments, such as loans and securities, and notional amounts for derivative instruments.     

We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.   

The valuation techniques used for our Level 3 assets and liabilities are described as follows:   

Discounted cash flow     This type of valuation technique involves developing a projection of expected future cash flows of an instrument and then discounting such cash flows using discount factors that consider the relative risk of the cash flows and the time value of money.      

For instruments that are valued by the Company using a discounted cash flow valuation technique, the rate of return, or discount rate, that is utilized for such purposes reflects specific characteristics of an instrument including, but not limited to the expected term of the instrument, its debt service coverage ratio or credit quality, geographic location, investment size and other attributes. 

o 

For performing multifamily, infrastructure bonds and certain TRS derivatives, the Company s projection of expected future cash flows reflects cash flows that are contractually due over the life of an instrument.  The Company generally utilizes the AAA Municipal Market Data tax-exempt rate ("  MMD  ") for each instrument s specific term and applies a market rate risk premium spread that reflects that instrument s specific credit characteristics, such as size, debt service coverage, state or bond type.     

o 

For non-performing bonds, subordinate cash flow bonds and certain TRS derivatives, the Company s projection of expected future cash flows reflects internally-generated projections over a 10-year investment period of future net operating income from the underlying properties that serve as collateral for our instruments, less estimated costs of  

54   

sale.  A terminal value is then added to the projected discounted projection to reflect the remaining value that is expected to be generated at the end of the projection period.  The Company utilizes geographic and sector specific discount rates that are published by an independent real estate research organization.      

o 

For   our   interest rate   swaps,   the Company s   projection of expected   future cash flows reflect  s     scheduled   settlement payments   that are expected to be exchanged over the life of such contracts.      

Dealer pricing     This valuation technique utilizes one dealer price to estimate fair value.      We generally validate these observations of fair value   through the use of a discounted cash flow technique whose unobservable inputs are disclosed in the table above.      

Hybrid PWERM   This valuation technique   is a hybrid between the probability weighted expected return methodology (   PWERM   ) and an options pricing methodology (   OPM   ) and estimates a probability weighted value across multiple scenarios but using the OPM to estimate the allocation of value within one or more of those scenarios.       

o 

The Hybrid Method estimates per share value of each class of stock covered by a warrant by considering a   probability   weighted analysis of enterprise values associated with a set of likely future scenarios for the issuer of stock. For each future scenario, the enterprise value is allocated to the different equity classes based on their respective economic rights. The future per-share values for each scenario are then discounted to the present and weighted by the probabilities associated with each scenario.      

o 

The OPM is used to allocate an issuer s equity value to its different equity share classes.  The OPM treats common stock and preferred stock as call options on the enterprise s equity value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preferences of the preferred stock. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to shareholders exceed the value of the liquidation preferences at the time of a liquidity event (for example, a merger or sale), assuming the enterprise has funds available to make a liquidation preference meaningful and collectible by the shareholders. The common stock is modeled as a call option that gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying equity value at a predetermined or exercise price. In the model, the exercise price is based on a comparison with the equity value rather than, as in the case of a "regular" call option, a comparison with a per-share stock price. Thus, common stock is considered to be a call option with a claim on the equity at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the preferred stock is liquidated.     

Significant unobservable inputs presented in the preceding tables are those we consider significant to the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability.  We consider unobservable inputs to be significant if, by their exclusion, the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability would be impacted by a predetermined percentage change, or based on qualitative factors, such as nature of the instrument, type of valuation technique used and the significance of the unobservable inputs relative to other inputs used within the valuation.  Following is a description of the significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. 

Market yield     is a   market   rate of return used to present value the future expected cash flow to arrive at the fair value of an instrument.      The   market yield     typically   consists of a benchmark rate component and a risk premium component.      The benchmark rate component,   for example,   MMD   or SIFMA, is generally   observable within the market and is necessary to appropriately reflect the time value of money.      The risk premium component reflects the amount of compensation market participants require due to the uncertainty inherent in the instrument     s cash flows resulting from risks such as credit and liquidity.  A significant decrease in this input in isolation would result in a significantly higher fair value measurement.     

Capitalization rate   is calculated as the ratio between the   NOI   produced by a commercial real estate property and the price   for   such asset.  A significant decrease in this input in isolation would result in a significantly higher fair value measurement.     

NOI annual growth rate     is the amount of future growth in   NOI   that the Company projects each property to generate on an annual basis. These annual growth estimates take into account the Company s expectation about the future increases, or decreases, in rental rates, vacancy rates, bad debt expense, concessions and operating expenses for each property.    Generally, an increase in NOI will result in an increase to the fair value of the property.     

Total   equity value        represents the value of the enterprise less the fair value of the debt resulting in the basis for allocating the equity value among the enterprise's classes of preferred and common stock.  A significant increase in this input in isolation would result in a significantly higher fair value measurement.     

Equity volatility       is the degree of varia  bility   of a trading price series over time as measured by the standard deviation of  

55   

returns.  Generally  ,   an increase in this input in isolation would result in a higher fair value measurement   for financial instruments with option type characteristics  .     

N  on-Recurring Changes in Fair Value     

At   September    3  0  , 2016, the Company measured   one of its loans classified as held for investment   at fair value on a non-recurring basis   for the purpose of recognizing an impairment loss  .    The fair value measurement of this loan, which was categorized as Level 3, was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.  Additionally, the Company recognized a $0.2 million lower of cost or market adjustment in the third quarter of 2016 related to one of its solar assets.  The fair value measurement of the solar asset, which was categorized as Level 3, was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.   

At the end of the third quarter of 2015, the Company measured its co-investment in SAWHF on a non-recurring basis for the purpose of recognizing an impairment loss.  The fair value measurement of this investment, which was categorized as Level 3, was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology  . 

A  dditional Disclosures Related To The Fair Value of Financial Instruments That Are Not Carried On The Consolidated Balance Sheets at Fair Value  

The    t  ables that follow provide information about the carrying amounts and fair values of those financial instruments of the Company for which fair value is not measured on a recurring basis and organizes such information based upon the level of the fair value hierarchy within which fair value measurements are categorized.  We have not included in such tables assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments (e.g., premises and equipment).

Certain of the Company s guarantee obligations, which had a carrying value of   $8.9   million as of September 30, 2016, are eliminated for financial reporting purposes.  Refer below to  Valuation Techniques  for more information about differences between the carrying value and disclosed fair value of the Company s guarantee obligations.     

56   

(1) 

Certain of the Company s guarantee obligations, which had a carrying value of   $10.8   million as of December 31, 2015, are eliminated for financial reporting purposes.  Refer below to  Valuation Techniques  for more information about differences between the carrying value and disclosed fair value of the Company s guarantee obligations.     

Valuation Techniques  

Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash     The carrying value of these assets approximate fair value due to the short-term nature and negligible credit risk inherent in them. 

Accrued interest and accounts receivable     The carrying value of these assets approximate fair value due to the short-term nature and negligible credit risk inherent in them. 

Asset management fee receivable from TC Fund I     Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow methodology pursuant to which contractual payments are discounted based upon a market yield. 

Guarantee fee receivable          The carrying value of this receivable approximates fair value due to the short-term nature and negligible credit risk inherent in such receivables  . 

Loans held for investment       Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow methodology pursuant to which contractual payments are discounted based upon market yields for similar loans.  

Notes payable and other debt          Fair value is measured   by discounting contractual cash flows using a market rate of interest or by estimating the fair value of the collateral supporting the debt arrangement, taking into account credit risk.   

Subordinated debt          T  he Company   measures   the fair value of the subordinate  d   debt by discounting contractual cash flows   based upon its   estimated market   yield,   which was   15.5%   and   20%   as of   September   30,   2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively  .  As outlined in the table above, at   September 30, 2016,   the aggregate fair value was   measured   at   $54.1   million.  At   September    3  0  , 201  6  , the   measured   fair value of this debt   would have been     $62.7   million and   $47.6   million using a   market yield   of   13%   and   18%  , respectively.  The   measured   fair value of this debt is inherently judgmental and based on management s assumption of market yields.  There can be no assurance that the Company could repurchase the remaining subordinated debt at the   measured   fair values reflected in the table above or that the debt would trade at that price. 

Guarantee obligations           The fair   value of these obligations   represents     an   estimate of   what we would pay to transfer such obligations to a third party in an orderly transaction   at the measurement date  .       The carrying value of these   obligations, which reflects the unamortized balance of deferred guarantee fees received by the Company (a systematic and rational method of amortization is used to subsequently measure such liabilities for reporting purposes),   approximate  s their   fair value.      However, a  s further discussed in Note 8,  Guarantees and Collateral,  the Company has guaranteed minimum yields on investment to investors in 11 LIHTC funds that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.  As a result, the unamortized balance of deferred guarantee fees associated with such funds is eliminated for reporting purposes.  Therefore, such amounts are not included in the carrying value of the Company s guarantee obligations as  

57   

reported in the preceding tables.  Nonetheless, the Company believes that, in measuring the fair value of these guarantees, market participants would assume that the unamortized balance of deferred guarantee fees is a reasonable proxy for what the Company would be expected to pay to assign its guarantee obligations to a third party.  Accordingly, the unamortized balance of deferred guarantee fees associated with such guarantees, while not included in the reported carrying value of the Company's guarantee obligations, is included in the disclosed fair value of the Company's guarantee obligations. 

N  ote     8     G  uarantees and Collateral  

G  uarantees     

The    C  ompany   has   guaranteed minimum yields on investment to   investors in 11 consolidated LIHTC funds, along with two additional guaranteed LIHTC funds that are not consolidated for reporting purposes (all   13   LIHTC   funds are collectively referred to hereinafter as the    Guaranteed Funds   ) and has agreed to indemnify the purchaser of the GP interests in those Guaranteed Funds from investor claims related to those guarantees.  The Company may have to perform under such guarantees for losses resulting from recapture of tax credits due to foreclosure or difficulties in maintaining occupancy with respect to the LTPPs in which the Guaranteed Funds are invested.  Guarantees and i  ndemnifications   that relate to the   11   Guaranteed Funds that the Company consolidated for reporting purposes will expire in full by the end of 2027 while the balance of the Company s indemnifications associated with Guaranteed Funds will expire by December 31, 2017. 

At   September    3  0  , 2016 and   December 31, 2015, the   11 Guaranteed Funds for which the Company has provided an indemnification to the purchaser of corresponding GP interests   held an aggregate of   $14.5   million and   $13.0   million in reserves, respectively.  While these reserves are not cross collateralized, they could be utilized by each Guaranteed Fund to bring projected investor yield to its guaranteed minimum.  This could mitigate, or reduce, the amount that the Company could otherwise be required to pay under its contractual obligations.  Additionally, because the Company holds a first mortgage revenue bond   from   certain LTPPs in certain Guaranteed Funds, we have control over the exercis  e   of default remedies (such as foreclosure) for certain LTPPs, thereby controlling potential exposure that we have under our guarantee and indemnification agreements.  As of   September    3  0  , 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had   $15.5   million and   $16.4   million, respectively, of collateral pledged towards this guarantee exposure.  If we are required to perform under our guarantees, we could, subject to third party consent, access or be reimbursed with this collateral.   

As bondholder of a defaulted LTPP in which one of the 11 Guaranteed Funds is an LP investor, the Company foreclosed on, and subsequently sold, the property of the defaulted LTPP in the first quarter of 2016.  This sale caused the redemption of our bond investment, as well as a loss of future tax credits and the recapture of tax credits previously taken.  As a result, the Company   made   a guarantee payment   of   $0.9   million   during the second quarter of 2016  .        The Company made no other guaranteed payments for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The Company does not have any recourse provisions that would enable it to recover from third parties any of the amounts that would be required to be paid under either of the aforementioned types of indemnifications.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company concluded there were no expected tax credit deficiencies that were both probable and estimable that would require it to make a payment related to these indemnification agreements.   

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the   Company had   $8.9   million and   $10.8   million, respectively, of unamortized fees related to indemnifications associated with the 11 Guaranteed Funds.  These unamortized fees are included   in the   Company s   measurement of its common shareholders  equity.  However, for presentation purposes, these unamortized fees are eliminated in consolidation against the 11 Guaranteed Funds  prepaid guarantee fees.   

The Company has agreed to indemnify specific investors in non-Guaranteed Funds related to   the performance on certain LTPPs  .  If a third party fails to perform on its financial obligation relating to the property s performance, the Company will be required to indemnify impacted investors.    Such indemnities will expire by December 31, 2017. 

On December 29, 2015, as part of TC Fund I s acquisition of a portfolio of limited partnership investments, TEI agreed to annually make mandatory loans to TC Fund I for distribution   to the   investor   involved in   this   transaction in the amount of   95%   of the excess, if any, of the projected tax credits for years 2016 to 2020 over the tax credits   actually allocated to the investor.  In addition, until December 31, 2025, TEI agreed to make mandatory loans to TC Fund I for distribution to the investor in the amount of tax credits previously claimed from 2016 to 2020 that are subsequently recaptured or otherwise reduced or lost, together with associated costs.  Mandatory loans are limited in amount to   70%   of projected tax credits in any year ($109.6 million of total maximum exposure  ) and may be subject to certain other limitations. In addition to these limitations, the bank will   absorb   5%   of any loss of tax credits  .  On this basis, the Company   recognized a   $4.2   million liability in connection with TEI s mandatory loan performance obligation  .  At   September   30, 2016, the Company had   $3.9   million of   unamortized fees related to the mandatory loan performance obligation.  However, if the Company were ever required to make a mandatory loan to TC Fund I, the Company would have the right to recover such payment to the extent there were available cash flows from TC Fund I to provide for such reimbursement. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $10.0 million of collateral pledged towards TC Fund I.

O  perating Leases  

As   of September   30  , 201  6  , the Company had   two   non-cancelable operating leases   that   expir  e   in 2020   and 2024  .  These leases require the Company to pay property taxes, maintenance and other costs.  The Company recognized rental expense   of   $0.1   million     for   the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,   and   $0.2   million and   $0.3   million for   the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  .

L  itigation  

From   time to   time, the Company and its subsidiaries are named as defendants in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course   of   business.  These proceedings may include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or for injunctive or declaratory relief.       

The Company establishes reserves for litigation matters when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Once established, reserves may be adjusted when new information is obtained.    At September 30, 2016, the Company   had no significant   litigation matters.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the weighted average number of options excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share was   2,222  , either because of their anti-dilutive effect (i.e. options that were not in the money) or because the option had contingent vesting requirements.    No   options were excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the weighted average number of options excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share was   24,211   either because of their anti-dilutive effect (i.e. options that were not in the money) or because the option had contingent vesting requirements.     

Common Shares 

On    D  ecember 14, 2015, the Board authorized a 2016 share repurchase program (   2016 Plan   ) for   up to   600,000   shares.  During the   third   quarter of 2016, the Company repurchased   64,762   shares at an average price of   $18.38  .        Between     October 1, 2016 and November 2, 2016,   the Company   repurchased   92,052   shares   at an average price of $  18.17  .  As of November 2, 2016, the Company had repurchased   564,022   shares at an average price of   $16.68   since   the inception of the 2016 Plan.    Effective at the filing of this Report and until mod  ified by further action by the B  oard, the maximum price at which management is currently     authorized to purchase shares is   $21.34   per share.   

Effective May 5, 2015, the Company adopted a Tax Benefits Rights Agreement (   Rights Plan   )   to help preserve the Company s net operating losses (   NOLs   )  .  In connection with adopting the Rights Plan, the Company declared a distribution of one right per common share to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2015.  The rights   do   not trade apart from the current common shares until the distribution date, as defined in the Rights Plan.  Under the Rights Plan,   the acquisition by an investor (or group of related investors) of   greater than a   4.9  % stake in the Company,   could result in   all existing shareholders other than the new 4.9% holder   having the right   to acquire new shares for a nominal cost, thereby significantly diluting the ownership interest of the acquiring person.  The Rights Plan will run for a period of five years, or until the Board determines the plan is no longer required, whichever comes first.

N  ote    1  1     S  tock-Based Compensation  

The Company has stock-based   compensation   plans (   Plans   ) for Non-employee Directors (   Non-employee Directors  Stock-Based Compensation Plans   ) and stock-based incentive compensation plans for employees (   Employees  Stock-Based Compensation Plans   ).   

The   following   table provides information related to t  otal compensation expense   that was   recorded for these Plans: 

E  mployees  Stock-Based Compensation Plans  

As   of     September    3  0  , 201  6  , there were   381,345   share awards available to be issued under Employees  Stock-Based Compensation Plans.  While each existing Employees  Stock-Based Compensation Plan has been approved by the Company s Board of Directors, not all of the Plans have been approved by the Company s shareholders.  The Plans that have not been approved by the Company s shareholders are currently restricted to the issuance of only stock options.  As a result, of the   381,345   shares available under the plans, only   17,205   are available to be issued in the form of either stock options or shares; all remaining share awards must be issued in the form of stock options.   

E  mployee Common Stock Options  

The Company   measures   the fair value of unvested options with time-based vesting and all vested options (both time-based and performance based) using a lattice model for purposes of recognizing compensation expense.  The Company believes the lattice model provides a better estimate of the fair value of these options as, according to   FASB s   Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718,  the design of a lattice model more fully reflects the substantive characteristics of a particular employee share option.   Because options granted with stock price targets contain a  market condition  under FASB s Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, a Monte Carlo simulation is used to simulate future stock price movements for the Company.  The Company believes a Monte Carlo simulation provides a better estimate of the fair value for unvested options granted with specific stock price targets as the model s flexibility allows for the fair value to account for the vesting provisions as well as the different probabilities of stock price outcomes.    All options with stock price targets are vested as of September 30, 2016.       

63   

The following table provides information related to option activity under the Employees  Stock-Based Compensation Plans: 

(1) 

Intrinsic value is based on outstanding options.     

The value of employee options increased by   $1.6   million   during the     nine months   ended   September 30, 2016,   due to the increase in market value of our stock price.  This increase was recognized as additional compensation expense.   

Employee Deferred Shares  

The following table summarizes the deferred shares granted to employees  :       

All employee deferred shares were vested and issued during the first quarter of 2016.    The Company recognized   $18,741   of additional compensation expense related to employee deferred shares during the   first quarter of 2016   mainly driven by the increase in MMA s share price and amortization of existing grants.   

N  on-Employee Directors  Stock-Based Compensation Plans  

The Non  -employee   Directors  Stock-based Compensation Plans authorize a total   of   1,130,000   shares   for issuance, of which   418,608   were available to be issued at   September    3  0  , 201  6  .    The Non-employee Directors  Stock-based Compensation Plans provide for grants of non-qualified common stock options, common shares, restricted shares and deferred shares.  

On March 12, 2015, the Board adopted an amendment to the Non-employee Directors      Stock-based Compensation Plans providing   for   directors to be   paid   $60,000   per year   with     50%   pa  yable   in cash and 50%   payable   in share based grants.  In addition, the Chairman receives an additional   $20,000   per year, the Audit Committee Chair receives an additional   $15,000   per year and the other committee chairs receive an additional   $10,000   per   year.   

The table below summarizes   non-employee   director compensation, including cash, vested options and common and deferred shares, for services rendered for the   nine months   ended   September   3  0  , 201  6   and 201  5  .  The directors are fully vested in the deferred shares at the grant date.

Due to the Company   generally having a   minimal ownership interest in certain consolidated entities, the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, equity in losses from those entities  unconsolidated LTPPs and the losses allocated to the noncontrolling interests of the consolidated entities have been separately identified   in our C  onsolidated   B  alance   S  heets and   Consolidated S  tatements of   O  perations.      Third-party ownership in these CFVs is recorded in equity as  Noncontrolling interests in CFVs   and IHS PM  .     

G  uaranteed Funds  

As further   discussed   in   Note   8  ,  Guarantees   and Collateral,  the Company   has   guaranteed minimum yields on investment to investors in 11 Guaranteed Funds that are consolidated by the Company for reporting purposes.  The Guaranteed Funds  primary assets are their investments in LTPPs, which are the owners of the affordable housing properties (see   Investments   in LTPPs in the Asset Summary below).  The Guaranteed Funds account for these investments using the equity method of accounting.     

C  onsolidated Property Partnerships  

As of September 30, 2016,   the Company is the general partner in three LTPPs in which it   holds equity interests   ranging from   0.01  % -   1.00%  .  Additionally,   on December 31, 2015, in conjunction with TC Fund I's acquisition of a portfolio of low income housing tax credit partnership investments, the Company acquired a   99.89%   limited partnership interest in an entity that owns an affordable multifamily   property.  Because the Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary, these four entities have been consolidated by the Company for financial reporting purposes as of September 30, 2016.  The investors in these consolidated entities have no recourse against the assets of the Company.

The assets of the LTPPs are primarily real estate and the liabilities are predominantly mortgage debt.     

The Company s exposure to loss   related to   the   Guaranteed   Funds and the underlying LTPPs   has two elements:  exposure to loss associated with our financial   guarantee  s     as described   above and   exposure to loss related to   the Company s   investments in   bonds that   are dependent upon repayment by   certain LTPPs   within   the   Guaranteed   Funds.   

Although the Company does not anticipate having to perform under its guarantees, the Company s maximum exposure to loss associated with our guarantees   was   $482.7   million at   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, while the Company s maximum exposure to loss related to its investments in   bonds was   $100.5   million and   $126.4   million at   September 30, 2016 and   December 31,   2015  , respectively.

Such controls include those designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (   CEO   ) and Chief Financial Officer (   CFO   ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the CEO and CFO, on the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.  Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that due to   the fact that remediation of   material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described   in our 2015 Form 10-K has not been completed as described   below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of   September    3  0  , 201  6  . 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP; (3) provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (4) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  It is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is therefore subject to human error and misjudgment.  In general, evaluations of effectiveness for future periods are subject to risk as controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with key processes or procedures.   

A deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.        A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  

As previously disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K, a  n evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our CEO and CFO, on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 based on criteria related to internal control over financial reporting described in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 Framework).  Based on this evaluation, management determined that because of the material weaknesses described below, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of   December   31, 201  5  .       

The Company did not maintain an effective control environment based on the following: 

The Company did not have adequately trained resources with assigned responsibility and accountability over the design and operation of internal controls; and      

The Company did not design and implement appropriate controls over the financial reporting activities conducted by third party service providers related to outsourced information technology and asset management processes.     

As a c  onsequen  ce of an ineffective control environment  , the Company did not   have   effective control   activitie  s over the following:   

The Company did not have effective general information technology controls (   GITCs   ), specifically program change controls and users  access to its servicing system and   bond   database and therefore the Company did not maintain effective  

74   

controls over the accounting for certain investments and related income. Additionally, the Company did not have adequate GITCs over electronic spreadsheets used in the financial reporting process.       

The Company did not have adequately designed and documented management review controls over the accounting for certain investments and related income or losses. Specifically, the management review controls did not adequately address management s expectations, criteria for investigation, and the level of precision used in the performance of the review controls.  Also, the management review controls did not address the completeness and accuracy of key assumptions and other data included in electronic spreadsheets.     

The control deficiencies described above did not result in any material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the   nine   months   ended   September    3  0  , 201  6  .  However, these control deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in the future, and therefore we concluded that the deficiencies   continue to   represent material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting   as of   September    3  0  , 2016  .   

C  hanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

Other than the implementation of the remediation plan described below,   t  here were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the   third   quarter of 201  6   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Management s Remediation Plan 

The Company will execute the following steps in 2016 to remediate the aforementioned material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting: 

All critical electronic spreadsheets that are used by the Company for financial reporting purposes will be evaluated for change controls and other GITCs and any identified gaps in such controls will be remediated.     

Management review controls that govern the Company s accounting for certain of its investments will be reassessed to determine the appropriate level of precision required to mitigate the potential for a material misstatement. The Company will also enhance its supporting documentation to   make   clear: (i) management s expectations related to financial results of transactions that are subject to such controls; (ii) the level of precision and criteria used for investigation; and (iii) evidenc  ing   that all outliers or exceptions that should have been identified, including items that should have fluctuated but did not. Additionally, the Company will also establish process level controls to support management review controls where appropriate.      

The Company will sponsor ongoing training related to the COSO 2013 Framework best practices for personnel that are accountable for internal control over financial reporting.     

As of   September   30, 2016, the Company   has   executed the following steps in connection with its   remediation plan  : 

The Company has implemented enhancements in GITCs over many of its   electronic spreadsheets that are used by the Company for financial reporting purposes   while the remediation of   identified   gaps in   change controls and other GITCs   over certain spreadsheets are   in the process of being remediated  .     

The Company implemented   procedural   enhancements related to a portion of its management review controls   over its investments in bonds, but is still in process of remediating identified control deficiencies related to certain of its other   management review controls.     

The Company   completed   training related to the COSO 2013 Framework best practices for personnel that are accountable for internal control over financial reporting.     

All enhancements to the Company s internal control over financial reporting that were implemented by the Company as of   September   30, 2016 are subject to continued evaluation by management and testing by the Company s registered public accountants.  Although we expect that full implementation of this plan will result in the remediation of the Company s material weaknesses, we cannot provide any assurance that these efforts will be successful, or that we will not identify additional control deficiencies in future periods.
