Note 1. Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Chico s FAS, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ) for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, such interim financial statements reflect all normal, recurring adjustments considered necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position, the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  , included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on   March 8, 2016  . 
  As used in this report, all references to  we,   us,   our,  and  the Company,  refer to Chico s FAS, Inc. and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
  Our fiscal years end on the Saturday closest to January 31 and are designated by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. Operating results for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. 
  Reclassifications 
  Reclassifications of certain prior year balances were made in order to conform to the current year presentation.  
  Change in Accounting Policy 
  Effective January 31, 2016, the Company made a voluntary change in accounting principle related to our classification of shipping expenses. Historically, we have presented shipping expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A"). Under the new policy, the Company is presenting these expenses within cost of good sold ("COGS") in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company believes that this change is preferable as the shipping expenses represent direct costs associated with the sale of our merchandise and improves comparability with the Company's peers. The accounting policy change was applied retrospectively to all periods presented. There was no change to consolidated net income, however, cost of sales increased by   $8.8 million   and SG A decreased by the same amount for the thirteen weeks ended   October 31, 2015  . The Company recorded   $8.6 million   in shipping expense as a component of COGS during the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  . For the year-to-date period ended   October 31, 2015  , cost of sales increased by   $27.6 million   and SG A decreased by the same amount. The Company recorded   $25.5 million   in shipping expense as a component of COGS during the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  . 
  Reclassification of Occupancy Expenses and Correction of Immaterial Accounting Error 
  The Company has changed its classification of store occupancy expenses. Historically, we have presented store occupancy expenses within SG A. As now reclassified, the Company is presenting these expenses within COGS in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company believes that the store occupancy expenses represent direct costs associated with the sale of our merchandise and improves comparability with the Company s peers. This reclassification was applied retrospectively to all periods presented. There was no change to consolidated net income, however, cost of sales increased by   $96.8 million   and SG A decreased by the same amount for the thirteen weeks ended   October 31, 2015  . The Company recorded   $95.4 million   in store occupancy expenses as a component of COGS during the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  . For the year-to-date period ended   October 31, 2015  , cost of sales increased by   $289.3 million   and SG A decreased by the same amount. The Company recorded   $287.3 million   in store occupancy expenses as a component of COGS during the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  . 
  The Company has also elected to correct the historical classification of shipping revenue within SG A. To correct the immaterial error, we are classifying shipping revenue as a component of net sales within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. There was no change to consolidated net income, however, net sales increased by    $4.2 million   and SG A increased by the same amount for the thirteen weeks ended   October 31, 2015  . The Company recorded   $3.0 million   in shipping revenue as a component of net sales during the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  . For the year-to-date period ended   October 31, 2015  , net sales increased by   $14.1 million   and SG A increased by the same amount. The Company recorded   $9.7 million   in shipping revenue as a component of net sales during the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  .

Adjustments to Presentation 
  The above mentioned changes had no cumulative effect on the presentation of the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, or Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The effects of the aforementioned accounting policy change, change in classification and error correction to the   October 31, 2015   unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income are as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Footnotes to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein have been adjusted to reflect the impact of these changes accordingly. 

Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU 2016-09 requires entities to recognize the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The standard also permits an employer to repurchase more of an employee's shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. This standard will be effective and adopted for our first quarter 2017. We are currently assessing the new standard and its impact to our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which replaces the existing guidance in Accounting Standard Codification 840, Leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize straight-line total rent expense. We are currently assessing the new standard and its impact to our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which modifies the presentation of noncurrent and current deferred taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We early adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2015, with retrospective presentation, as shown in our consolidated balance sheets. Our retrospective presentation resulted in a   $26.9 million   reclassification from current assets to other assets, net for the period ending   October 31, 2015  . 
  In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330). The amendments, which apply to inventory that is measured using any method other than the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or retail inventory method, require that entities measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016 and should be applied on a prospective basis. We are currently assessing the potential impact of adopting this ASU, but do not, at this time, anticipate a material impact to our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The update outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral of the effective date, to make it effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard allows for either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective transition method. The FASB has issued subsequent ASUs related to ASU No. 2014-09, which detail amendments to the ASU, implementation considerations, narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients. We are currently assessing the new standard and all related ASUs and its impact to our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  

Note 3. Restructuring and Strategic Charges    
  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we initiated a restructuring program, including the acceleration of domestic store closures and an organizational realignment, to ensure that resources align with long-term growth initiatives, including omni-channel. In fiscal 2015, in connection with the restructuring program, we completed an evaluation of the Boston Proper brand, completed the sale of the Boston Proper direct-to-consumer business, and closed its stores.  
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we announced an expansion of our restructuring program to further align the organizational structure with long-term growth initiatives, including transition of executive leadership, and to reduce COGS and SG A through strategic initiatives. These strategic initiatives include realigning marketing and digital commerce, improving supply chain efficiency, and reducing non-merchandise and marketing expenses. In fiscal 2016, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring and strategic charges of   $10.8 million   for the   third   quarter and   $31.0 million   year-to-date, primarily related to outside services, severance and proxy solicitation costs.  
  In connection with the restructuring program, we evaluated our domestic store portfolio and identified approximately   175   stores for closure, with   90   stores across our brands, including   20   Boston Proper stores, closed through the   third   quarter of fiscal 2016. As a result, we expect to incur additional cash charges related to lease termination expenses of approximately   $1.7 million   through fiscal 2017 related to these future closures.

A summary of the pre-tax restructuring and strategic charges is presented in the table below: 

As of   October 29, 2016  , a reserve of   $18.1 million   related to restructuring and strategic activities was included in other current and deferred liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. A roll-forward of the reserve is presented as follows: 

Note 4. Stock-Based Compensation  
  For the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , stock-based compensation expense was   $15.5 million   and   $20.7 million  , respectively. As of   October 29, 2016  , approximately   5.8 million   shares remain available for future grants of equity awards under our 2012 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan. 
  Restricted Stock Awards 
  Restricted stock award activity for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   was as follows:

Performance-based Stock Units 
  For the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , we granted performance-based restricted stock units ( PSUs ), contingent upon the achievement of a Company-specific performance goal during fiscal   2016  . Any units earned as a result of the achievement of this goal will vest over   3 years   from the date of grant and will be settled in shares of our common stock. 
  Performance-based restricted stock unit activity for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   was as follows: 

(1)    The performance goal for the PSUs granted in 2015 was not fully met. Forfeitures for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   include the portion of the fiscal 2015 PSUs that were not earned.  
     Stock Option Awards 
  For the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , we did not grant any stock options. 
  Stock option activity for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   was as follows: 

Note 5. Income Taxes 
  The provision for income taxes is based on a current estimate of the annual effective tax rate and is adjusted as necessary for quarterly events. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items, and the mix of earnings. 
  For the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , the effective tax rate was   22.9%   and   (55.7)%  , respectively. For the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , the income tax provision was   $7.0 million   compared to the income tax benefit of   $14.6 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   October 31, 2015  . The favorability in the effective tax rate for the   third   quarter of   2016   primarily reflects an additional tax benefit related to the disposition of Boston Proper's stock and the realization of income tax credits in 2016. The income tax benefit for the   third   quarter of   2015   of   $14.6 million   and effective tax rate of   (55.7)%   primarily reflected the tax benefit related to the disposition of Boston Proper's stock and the impact of the Boston Proper goodwill and trade name impairment on the annual effective tax rate.

  (Unaudited) 

For the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , the income tax provision of   $40.1 million   and effective tax rate of   34.0%   primarily reflected the pre-tax net income during the year and the additional tax benefit related to the disposition of Boston Proper's stock and the realization of income tax credits in 2016. For the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 31, 2015  , the income tax benefit was   $23.1 million  . The effective tax rate of   34.0%   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   was not comparable to the effective tax rate for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 31, 2015   primarily due to the tax benefit recorded in fiscal   2015   related to the disposition of Boston Proper's stock and the impact of the Boston Proper goodwill impairment on the annual effective tax rate.  

Note 6. Earnings Per Share 
  In accordance with relevant accounting guidance, unvested share-based payment awards that include non-forfeitable rights to dividends, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities. As a result, such awards are required to be included in the calculation of earnings per common share pursuant to the  two-class  method. For us, participating securities are composed entirely of unvested restricted stock awards and PSUs that have met their relevant performance criteria. 
  Earnings per share ( EPS ) is determined using the two-class method when it is more dilutive than the treasury stock method. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, including participating securities. Diluted EPS reflects the dilutive effect of potential common shares from non-participating securities such as stock options and PSUs. 
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS shown on the face of the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

For the thirteen weeks weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  ,   0.7 million   and   0.3 million   potential shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the diluted per share calculation relating to non-participating securities, because the effect of including these potential shares was antidilutive. 
  For the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  ,   0.9 million   and   1.3 million   potential shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the diluted per share calculation relating to non-participating securities, because the effect of including these potential shares was antidilutive.

Note 7. Fair Value Measurements 
  Our financial instruments consist of cash, money market accounts, marketable securities, assets held in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, accounts receivable and payable, and debt. Cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. 
  Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and as of   October 29, 2016   generally consist of     corporate bonds, U.S. government agencies, municipal securities, and commercial paper with   $25.4 million   of securities with maturity dates within one year or less and   $25.0 million   with maturity dates over one year and less than two years. 
  We consider all marketable securities available-for-sale, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, and therefore classify these securities within current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as they are available to support current operational liquidity needs. Marketable securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of income taxes, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, cost is determined on a specific identification basis. 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Entities are required to use a three-level hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. 
  The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:    
                       
    Level 1 
      
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

Level 2 
      
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or; Unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or; Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability 

Level 3 
      
    Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 

We measure certain financial assets at fair value on a recurring basis, including our marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale securities, certain cash equivalents, specifically our money market accounts, and assets held in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The money market accounts are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. Our marketable securities are generally valued based on other observable inputs for those securities (including market corroborated pricing or other models that utilize observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves) based on information provided by independent third party pricing entities, except for U.S. government securities which are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. The investments in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan are valued using quoted market prices and are included in other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  From time to time, we measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, including evaluation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment using company-specific assumptions which would fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We estimate the fair value of assets held for sale using market values for similar assets which would fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
  To assess the fair value of long-term debt, we utilize a discounted future cash flow model using current borrowing rates for similar types of debt of comparable maturities. 
  Fair value calculations contain significant judgments and estimates, which may differ from actual results due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to the business model or changes in operating performance. 
  During the quarter ended   October 29, 2016  , we did not make any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 financial instruments. Furthermore, as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , we did not have any Level 3 financial instruments. We conduct reviews on a quarterly basis to verify pricing, assess liquidity, and determine if significant inputs have changed that would impact the fair value hierarchy disclosure.

Note 8. Debt 
  In fiscal 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Agreement) providing for a term loan of   $100.0 million   and a revolving credit facility of   $100.0 million  . The term loan and revolving credit facility mature on May 4, 2020 and accrue interest by reference, at our election, at either an adjusted eurodollar rate tied to LIBOR or an Alternate Base Rate plus an interest rate margin, as defined in the Agreement. The Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and affirmative covenants, including the requirement to maintain certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with the applicable ratio requirements and other covenants at   October 29, 2016  . As of   October 29, 2016  , we had total available borrowing capacity of   $100.0 million   under our revolving credit facility. 
  The following table provides details on our debt outstanding as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

Note 9. Share Repurchases 
  During the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , we repurchased   6.5 million   shares, under our share repurchase program announced in November 2015 at a total cost of approximately   $76.3 million  . As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company has   $183.7 million   remaining under the share repurchase program. However, we have no continuing obligation to repurchase shares under this authorization, and the timing, actual number and value of any additional shares to be purchased will depend on the performance of our stock price, market conditions and other considerations. 

Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies  
  In July 2015, the Company was named as a defendant in Altman v. White House Black Market, Inc., a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The Complaint alleges that the Company, in violation of federal law, published more than the last five digits of a credit or debit card number or an expiration date on customers' receipts. The Company denies the material allegations of the complaint. Its motion to dismiss was denied on July 13, 2016, but the Company continues to believe that the case is without merit and is not appropriate for class treatment. It intends to vigorously defend the matter. At this time however, it is not possible to predict whether the proceeding will be permitted to proceed as a class or the size of the putative class, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in its defense on the merits or otherwise. Because the case is still in the early stages and class determinations have not been made, the Company is unable to estimate any potential loss or range of loss. 
  In June 2015, the Company was named as a defendant in Ackerman v. Chico s FAS, Inc., a putative representative Private Attorney General action filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. The Complaint alleges numerous violations of California law related to wages, meal periods, rest periods, wage statements, and failure to reimburse business expenses, among other things. Plaintiff subsequently amended her complaint to make the same allegations on a class action basis. In June 2016, the parties submitted a proposed settlement of the matter to the court, and the court granted preliminary approval on August 26, 2016, and settlement notices have been distributed. If finally approved, the proposed settlement will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
  In March 2016, the Company was named as a defendant in Cunningham v. Chico s FAS, Inc., a putative class action filed in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego. Given the overlap with the claims alleged in the Ackerman case, described above, the Court initially stayed the Cunningham case pending final approval of the Ackerman settlement. In October 2016, the parties agreed to lift the stay and to resolve the matter as an individual action. The Court has since dismissed the case. The settlement amount was immaterial.

In June 2016, the Company was named as a defendant in Rodems v. Chico s FAS, Inc., a putative class action filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Fresno. Plaintiff sought to represent current and former nonexempt employees of Chico s stores in California. The Complaint alleged many of the same Labor Code violations as Ackerman, described above. As a result, the court stayed the matter pending final approval of the Ackerman proposed settlement. The Company and the plaintiff subsequently agreed to a lifting of the stay and a filing of an amended complaint in early November, and the Company removed the case to the United State District Court for the Eastern District of California on November 9, 2016. In the proposed First Amended Complaint, the plaintiff makes similar claims of Labor Code violations against the Company but does not seek to represent a putative class or make class action allegations. The Company disputes the allegations of the First Amended Complaint and, at this time, does not expect that this case will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition or results of operation. 
  On July 28, 2016, the Company was named as a defendant in Calleros v. Chico s FAS, Inc., a putative class action filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Barbara. Plaintiff alleges that the Company failed to comply with California law requiring it to provide consumers cash for gift cards with a stored value of less than $10.00. The Company believes that the matter is not appropriate for class treatment; however, it is not possible to predict whether it will be permitted to proceed as a class or the size of the putative class, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in its defense of this action on the merits or otherwise. Because class determinations have not been made, the Company is unable to estimate any potential loss or range of loss were it to lose on the merits of the case. However, the case is scheduled for voluntary mediation on November 28, 2016, and, at this time, the Company does not expect that the case will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial conditions or results of operation.  
  Other than as noted above, we are not currently a party to any legal proceedings other than claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. All such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes may not be predictable. Consequently, the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of   October 29, 2016   are not estimable. However, while such matters could affect our consolidated operating results when resolved in future periods, management believes that upon final disposition, any monetary liability or financial impact to us would not be material to our annual consolidated financial statements. 

Note 11. Subsequent Events 
  On November 22, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of   $0.08   per share on our common stock. The dividend will be payable on December 19, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2016. Although it is our Company s intention to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend in the future, any decision to pay future cash dividends will be made by the Board of Directors and will depend on future earnings, financial condition and other factors.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and our   2015   Annual Report to Stockholders. 

Executive Overview 
  We are a leading omni-channel specialty retailer of women s private branded, sophisticated, casual-to-dressy clothing, intimates, complementary accessories, and other non-clothing items operating under the Chico s, White House Black Market ( WHBM ) and Soma brand names. We earn revenues and generate cash through the sale of merchandise in our domestic and international retail stores, on our various websites, through our call center which takes orders for all of our brands, and through an unaffiliated franchise partner in Mexico. 
  We utilize an integrated omni-channel approach to managing our business. For each of our brands, we want our customers to view the brand, through all of its various sales channels, as an integrated experience, rather than viewing it through a single channel (such as the store or the website). This approach allows our customers to browse, purchase, return, or exchange our merchandise through whatever sales channel and at whatever time is most convenient. As a result, we track total sales and comparable sales on a combined basis. 
  Net sales for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   were   $596.9 million   compared to   $645.4 million   in last year's   third   quarter. This   decrease   of   7.5%   included   $18.7 million   related to Boston Proper. Excluding Boston Proper from fiscal 2015, net sales decreased 4.8% and primarily reflected a   4.9%     decrease   in comparable sales, comprised of a decrease in transaction count and lower average dollar sale. Third quarter average unit retail increased with a decline in promotional activity. 
  We reported net   income   for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   of   $23.6 million  , or   $0.18   per diluted share, compared to a net   loss   of   $11.6 million  , or   $0.09   per diluted share, in last year s   third   quarter. Results for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   include restructuring and strategic charges of   $6.8 million   after-tax, or   $0.05   per diluted share, primarily consisting of outside services, partially offset by an additional tax benefit on the disposition of Boston Proper's stock of   $4.0 million  , or   $0.03   per diluted share. Results for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015   include the impact of Boston Proper non-cash goodwill and trade name impairment charges of   $23.9 million   after-tax, or   $0.18   per diluted share, restructuring and strategic charges of   $1.9 million   after-tax, or   $0.01   per diluted share, primarily related to property and equipment impairment charges for the Boston Proper stores, and the operating loss related to Boston Proper of   $3.5 million  , or   $0.03   per diluted share. The change in earnings per share also reflects the impact of approximately   10.2 million   shares repurchased since the end of the   third   quarter last year. 
  Net sales for the year-to-date period of fiscal   2016   were   $1.876 billion  , a decrease of 7.5% compared to   $2.029 billion   in last year s year-to-date period. Net income for the year-to-date period of fiscal   2016   was   $77.7 million  , or   $0.58   per diluted share, compared to net income of   $23.0 million  , or   $0.16   per diluted share last year. Results for the year-to-date period of fiscal   2016   include restructuring and strategic charges of   $19.4 million   after-tax, or   $0.15   per diluted share, primarily consisting of severance, proxy solicitation costs, and outside services, partially offset by an additional tax benefit on the disposition of Boston Proper's stock of   $4.0 million  , or   $0.03   per diluted share. Results for the year-to-date period of fiscal   2015   include the impact of Boston Proper non-cash goodwill and trade name impairment charges of   $71.0 million   after-tax, or   $0.50   per diluted share, restructuring and strategic charges of   $21.2 million   after-tax, or   $0.15   per diluted share, primarily related to property and equipment impairment charges, employee-related costs and lease termination charges, a tax benefit related to the disposition of Boston Proper's stock of   $23.8 million  , or   $0.17   per diluted share, and the operating loss related to Boston Proper of   $8.2 million  , or   $0.06   per diluted share. The change in earnings per share also reflects the impact of approximately   10.2 million   shares repurchased since the end of the   third   quarter last year. 
  Our Business Strategy 
  Our overall business strategy is focused on building and cultivating a portfolio of high-performing retail brands serving the fashion needs of women 35 years and older. We are focused on increasing the sales volume and profitability of our existing brands through our four focus areas: (1) evolving the customer experience, (2) strengthening our brands' positions, (3) leveraging actionable retail science, and (4) sharpening our financial principles. Over the long term, we may build our brand portfolio by organic development or acquisition of other specialty retail concepts if research indicates that the opportunity complements our current brands and is appropriate and in the best interest of the shareholders.

     Table of Contents  

We pursue the growth of the brands in our portfolio by building our omni-channel capabilities, which includes managing our store base and our growing online presence, executing marketing plans, effectively leveraging expenses and optimizing the potential of each of our three brands. We have invested heavily in our omni-channel capabilities in order to allow customers to fully experience our brands, through more than one channel. In essence, we view our various sales channels as a single, integrated process rather than as separate sales channels operating independently. To that end, we often refer to our brands' respective websites as "our largest store" within the brand.  
  Under this integrated, omni-channel approach, we encourage our customers to take advantage of each of our sales channels in whatever way best fits their needs. Customers may shop our products through one channel and consummate the purchase through a different channel. Our domestic customers have the option of returning merchandise to a store or to our distribution center, regardless of the channel used for purchase. We believe this omni-channel approach meets our customers  expectations, enhances the customer experience, contributes to the overall success of our brands, reflects that our customers do not differentiate between channels, and is consistent with how we plan and manage our business. As a result, we maintain a shared inventory platform for our operations, allowing us to fulfill orders for all channels from our distribution center in Winder, Georgia. We also fulfill in-store orders directly from other stores or our distribution center and offer domestic online and catalog customers the option of returning items to our stores. 
  We seek to acquire and retain omni-channel customers by leveraging existing customer-specific data and through targeted marketing, including e-marketing, television, catalogs and mailers. We seek to optimize the potential of our brands with improved product offerings, which includes potential new merchandise opportunities and brand extensions that complement the current offerings, as well as our continued emphasis on our  Most Amazing Personal Service  standard. 
    In 2016, we announced new initiatives to realign marketing and digital commerce, improve supply chain efficiency, and reduce non-merchandise and marketing expenses. Actions taken as part of these initiatives are expected to reduce expenses and complexity, standardize processes and improve the Company's ability to respond in real-time to changes in customer demand for merchandise.

  Net Sales 
  The following table depicts net sales by Chico s, WHBM, Soma and Boston Proper in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

Net sales for the   third   quarter   decreased   to   $596.9 million   from   $645.4 million   in last year s   third   quarter. This   7.5%   decrease includes   $18.7 million   related to Boston Proper in last year s   third   quarter and primarily reflects a   4.9%     decrease   in comparable sales, comprised of reduced transaction count and lower average dollar sale. For the third quarter, average unit retail increased with a decline in promotional activity. Net sales reflects   36   net store closures, including   20   Boston Proper store closures, or a   1.7%   net decrease in selling square footage since last year's   third   quarter.  
  The following table depicts comparable sales percentages by Chico's, WHBM and Soma for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

Cost of Goods Sold/Gross Margin 
  The following table depicts cost of goods sold and gross margin in dollars and gross margin as a percentage of total net sales for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

For the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016  , gross margin was   $230.3 million  , or   38.6%  , compared to   $249.2 million  , or   38.6%  , in last year s   third   quarter. When excluding Boston Proper from fiscal 2015, gross margin decreased 40 basis points in fiscal   2016   compared to gross margin of   $244.2 million  , or   39.0%   last year. This decrease in gross margin rate primarily reflects an improvement in merchandise margin, which was more than offset by deleverage of occupancy costs and an increase in incentive compensation.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  The following table depicts SG A, which includes direct operating expenses, marketing expenses and National Store Support Center ( NSSC ) expenses, in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

For the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016  , SG A was   $188.4 million   compared to   $226.3 million   in last year's   third   quarter. SG A was   31.6%   of net sales, a   350   basis point   decrease   from last year's   third   quarter, primarily due a reduction in marketing spend in fiscal 2016,   $11.5 million   of SG A related to Boston Proper in fiscal 2015, and savings in store labor, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation. 
  Restructuring and Strategic Charges  
  In fiscal 2014, we initiated a restructuring program, including the acceleration of domestic store closures and an organizational realignment, to ensure that resources are aligned with long-term growth initiatives, including omni-channel. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we announced an expansion of our restructuring program to further align the organizational structure with long-term growth initiatives, including transition of executive leadership, and to reduce COGS and SG A through strategic initiatives. These strategic initiatives include realigning marketing and digital commerce, improving supply chain efficiency, and reducing non-merchandise and marketing expenses. We have continued to execute on our cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives, including an organizational redesign in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 which clarified roles, responsibilities and processes across our brands and shared service center. 
  In connection with this effort, in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016  , we recorded pre-tax restructuring and strategic charges totaling   $10.8 million  , primarily consisting of outside services related to cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives, compared to   $3.1 million   in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015  , primarily consisting of Boston Proper lease termination charges. The after-tax impact of the restructuring and strategic charges in the   third   quarter totaled   $6.8 million  , or   $0.05   per diluted share, compared to   $1.9 million  , or   $0.01   per diluted share in fiscal   2015  . 
  In connection with the restructuring program, we evaluated our domestic store portfolio and identified approximately   175   stores for closure, with   90   stores across our brands, including   20   Boston Proper stores, closed through the   third   quarter of fiscal 2016. As a result, we expect to incur additional cash charges related to lease termination expenses of approximately   $1.7 million   through fiscal 2017 related to these future closures.  
    Provision for Income Taxes 
  Our effective tax rate for the   third   quarter was   22.9%   compared to an effective tax rate of   (55.7)%   in last year's   third   quarter. The favorability in the effective tax rate for the   third   quarter of   2016   primarily reflects an additional tax benefit related to the disposition of Boston Proper's stock and the realization of income tax credits in 2016. The income tax benefit of   $14.6 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015   and effective tax rate of   (55.7)%   primarily reflected the tax benefit related to the disposition of Boston Proper's stock and the tax impact of the Boston Proper goodwill and trade name impairment on the annual effective tax rate. Excluding the net after-tax impact of restructuring and strategic charges and the exit of Boston Proper, the effective tax rate for the   third   quarter of   2016   would have been 36.2% compared to 37.0% in the same period last year.  
  Net Income and Earnings Per Diluted Share 
  We reported net   income   for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   of   $23.6 million  , or   $0.18   per diluted share, compared to net   loss   of   $11.6 million  , or   $0.09   per diluted share in last year s   third   quarter. Results for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   include the impact of restructuring and strategic charges of   $6.8 million   after-tax, or   $0.05   per diluted share, primarily related to outside services related to cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives, partially offset by an additional tax benefit related to the exit of Boston Proper of   $4.0 million  , or   $0.03   per diluted share. Results for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015   include charges of   $29.3 million   after-tax, or   $0.22   per diluted share, related to Boston Proper non-cash goodwill and trade name impairment charges, restructuring and strategic charges and Boston Proper operating results. The change in earnings per share also reflects the impact of approximately   10.2 million   shares repurchased since the end of the   third   quarter last year.

Net sales for the year-to-date period   decreased   to   $1.876 billion   from   $2.029 billion   in last year s year-to-date period. This   7.6%   decrease includes   $70.3 million   related to Boston Proper last year and primarily reflects a   4.0%     decrease   in comparable sales, comprised of a decrease in transaction count and average dollar sale.

When excluding Boston Proper from fiscal   2015  , gross margin decreased 110 basis points in fiscal   2016   compared to   $786.5 million  , or   40.2%  , last year. The decrease is primarily due to sales deleverage of store occupancy expense.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  The following table depicts SG A, which includes store and direct operating expenses, marketing expenses and NSSC expenses, in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

For the year-to-date period of fiscal   2016  , SG A was   $583.1 million   compared to   $661.5 million   in last year s year-to-date period. SG A was   31.1%   of net sales, a   150   basis point   decrease   from last year, primarily due to   $40.5 million   of SG A related to Boston Proper in fiscal 2015, and a reduction in marketing spend and store labor, partially offset by employee benefit costs in fiscal   2016  .  
  Restructuring and Strategic Charges 
  Restructuring and strategic charges for the year-to-date period of fiscal   2016   were   $31.0 million   pre-tax, primarily consisting of outside services, severance, proxy solicitation costs, compared to   $34.2 million   in fiscal   2015  , primarily consisting of non-cash property and equipment impairment charges, continuing employee-related costs, lease termination charges and severance charges. The after-tax impact of the restructuring and strategic charges totaled   $19.4 million  , or   $0.15   per diluted share, compared to   $21.2 million  , or   $0.15   per diluted share in fiscal   2015  . 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  For the year-to-date period of fiscal   2016  , the income tax provision of   $40.1 million   and effective tax rate of   34.0%   primarily reflected the pre-tax net income during the period and the additional tax benefit related to the disposition of Boston Proper's stock and the realization of income tax credits in 2016. For the year-to-date period of fiscal   2015  , the income tax benefit was   $23.1 million  . The effective tax rate for the year-to-date period of fiscal   2015   was not comparable to the   34.0%   effective tax rate for the year-to-date period of fiscal   2016  , primarily due to the tax benefit recorded in fiscal   2015   related to the disposition of Boston Proper's stock and the impact of the Boston Proper goodwill impairment on the annual effective tax rate.  
    Net Income and Earnings Per Diluted Share 
    Net income for the year-to-date period of fiscal   2016   was   $77.7 million  , or   $0.58   per diluted share, compared to net income of   $23.0 million  , or   $0.16   per diluted share, in last year's year-to-date period. Results for the year-to-date period of fiscal   2016   include the impact of restructuring and strategic charges of   $19.4 million   after-tax, or   $0.15   per diluted share, primarily related to outside services, severance, proxy solicitation costs, partially offset by an additional tax benefit related to the exit of Boston Proper of   $4.0 million  , or   $0.03   per diluted share. Results for the year-to-date period of fiscal   2015   include charges of   $76.7 million   after tax, or   $0.54   per diluted share, related to Boston Proper non-cash goodwill and trade name impairment charges, restructuring and strategic charges, a tax benefit as a result of the disposition of Boston Proper's stock and Boston Proper operating results. The change in earnings per share also reflects the impact of approximately   10.2 million   shares repurchased since the end of the   third   quarter last year. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We believe that our existing cash and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, available credit facilities and potential future borrowings will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures, working capital needs, dividend payments, potential share repurchases, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, while it is our intention to repurchase our stock and pay a quarterly cash dividend in the future, any determination to repurchase additional shares of our stock or pay future dividends will be made by the Board of Directors and will depend on our stock price, future earnings, financial condition, and other factors considered by the Board. 
  Our ongoing capital requirements will continue to be primarily for enhancing and expanding our omni-channel capabilities, including: information technology and relocated, remodeled and new stores.

Operating Activities  
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the year-to-date period of fiscal   2016   was   $144.4 million  ,   an increase   of approximately   $14.3 million   from last year's year-to-date period. This   increase   primarily reflected the change in working capital, partially offset by lower net income compared to prior year when adjusted for non-cash impairment charges and the deferred tax benefit related to the exit of Boston Proper, as well as lower stock compensation expense and depreciation and amortization. The change in working capital is primarily due to a decrease in net income tax receivable, improved inventory management and the timing of payables.  
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities for the year-to-date period of fiscal   2016   was   $35.9 million   compared to   $12.6 million   provided by investing activities in last year's year-to-date period, primarily reflecting a   $79.4 million     decrease   in marketable securities related to share repurchases in fiscal 2015. Investing activities in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   included net purchases of property and equipment totaling   $35.7 million   compared to   $66.6 million   in the same period last year, consistent with our overall business strategy.  
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities for the year-to-date period of fiscal   2016   was   $118.1 million   compared to   $184.9 million   in last year's year-to-date period. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities primarily reflects a decrease of   $179.2 million   in share repurchases in fiscal   2016   compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by net borrowings of   $95.0 million   under our Credit Agreement in fiscal 2015. 
  Store and Franchise Activity 
  During the fiscal   2016   year-to-date period, we had   8   net store closure, consisting of net closures of   10   Chico's and   4   WHBM stores, and openings of   6   Soma stores. Currently, we expect an additional 9 net store closures in fiscal   2016  , reflecting approximately 8 net closures of Chico's stores and 1 net WHBM closure. We continuously evaluate the appropriate new store growth rate in light of economic conditions and may adjust the growth rate as conditions require or as opportunities arise. As of   October 29, 2016  , we also sold merchandise through   88   international franchise locations. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and believes the assumptions and estimates, as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  , are significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position.  
  In fiscal 2016 we implemented changes to our accounting policy for the classification of shipping expense, corrected an immaterial error in the classification of shipping revenue and changed the classification of occupancy expenses. Please see Note 1 in our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description and reconciliation of these matters.  
  Other than discussed above, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  .

Forward-Looking Statements 
  This Form 10-Q may contain certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which reflect our current views with respect to certain events that could have an effect on our future financial performance, including but without limitation, statements regarding our plans, objectives, the implementation of our previously announced restructuring program and organizational redesign for improved business performance, including our re-balancing of our store fleet and streamlining the headquarter workforce, and the future success of our store concepts. These statements may address items such as future sales and sales initiatives, gross margin expectations, SG A expectations (particularly estimated expected savings), operating margin expectations, earnings per share expectations, planned store openings, closings and expansions, future comparable sales, future product sourcing plans, inventory levels, planned marketing expenditures, planned capital expenditures and future cash needs. In addition, from time to time, we may issue press releases and other written communications, and our representatives may make oral statements, which contain forward-looking information. 
  These statements, including those in this Form 10-Q and those in press releases or made orally, relate to expectations concerning matters that are not historical fact and may include the words or phrases such as  expects,   believes,   anticipates,   plans,   estimates,   approximately,   our planning assumptions,   future outlook,  and similar expressions. Except for historical information, matters discussed in such oral and written statements, including this Form 10-Q, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based largely on information currently available to our management and on our current expectations, assumptions, plans, estimates, judgments and projections about our business and our industry, and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those currently anticipated. Although we believe our expectations are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions, they are not guarantees of performance and there are a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, contingencies, and other factors (many of which are outside our control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there is no assurance that our expectations will, in fact, occur or that our estimates or assumptions will be correct, and we caution investors and all others not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The market risk of our financial instruments as of   October 29, 2016   has not significantly changed since   January 30, 2016  . We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on any future indebtedness and our marketable securities and from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
  Our exposure to interest rate risk relates in part to our revolving line of credit with our bank. On May 4, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement, as further discussed in Note 7. The Agreement, which matures on May 4, 2020, has borrowing options which accrue interest by reference, at our election, at either an adjusted eurodollar rate tied to LIBOR or an Alternate Base Rate plus an interest rate margin, as defined in the Agreement. An increase or decrease in market interest rates of 100 basis points would not have a material effect on annual interest expense.  
  Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which identifies allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. Our investment portfolio consists of cash equivalents and marketable securities including municipal securities, corporate bonds, U.S. government agencies and commercial paper.     The marketable securities portfolio as of   October 29, 2016  , consisted of   $25.4 million   of securities with maturity dates within one year or less and   $25.0 million   with maturity dates over one year and less than or equal to two years. We consider all marketable securities available-for-sale, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments within current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as they are available to support current operational liquidity needs. As of   October 29, 2016  , an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio. 

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance in timely alerting them to material information relating to us (including our consolidated subsidiaries) and that information required to be disclosed in our reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported as required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. 
  Changes in Internal Controls 
  There were no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect our disclosure controls and procedures subsequent to the date of the above referenced evaluation. Furthermore, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the quarterly period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

In July 2015, the Company was named as a defendant in Altman v. White House Black Market, Inc., a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The Complaint alleges that the Company, in violation of federal law, published more than the last five digits of a credit or debit card number or an expiration date on customers' receipts. The Company denies the material allegations of the complaint. Its motion to dismiss was denied on July 13, 2016, but the Company continues to believe that the case is without merit and is not appropriate for class treatment. It intends to vigorously defend the matter. At this time however, it is not possible to predict whether the proceeding will be permitted to proceed as a class or the size of the putative class, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in its defense on the merits or otherwise. Because the case is still in the early stages and class determinations have not been made, the Company is unable to estimate any potential loss or range of loss. 
  In June 2015, the Company was named as a defendant in Ackerman v. Chico s FAS, Inc., a putative representative Private Attorney General action filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. The Complaint alleges numerous violations of California law related to wages, meal periods, rest periods, wage statements, and failure to reimburse business expenses, among other things. Plaintiff subsequently amended her complaint to make the same allegations on a class action basis. In June 2016, the parties submitted a proposed settlement of the matter to the court, and the court granted preliminary approval on August 26, 2016, and settlement notices have been distributed. If finally approved, the proposed settlement will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
  In March 2016, the Company was named as a defendant in Cunningham v. Chico s FAS, Inc., a putative class action filed in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego. Given the overlap with the claims alleged in the Ackerman case, described above, the Court initially stayed the Cunningham case pending final approval of the Ackerman settlement. In October 2016, the parties agreed to lift the stay and to resolve the matter as an individual action. The Court has since dismissed the case. The settlement amount was immaterial. 
  In June 2016, the Company was named as a defendant in Rodems v. Chico s FAS, Inc., a putative class action filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Fresno. Plaintiff sought to represent current and former nonexempt employees of Chico s stores in California. The Complaint alleged many of the same Labor Code violations as Ackerman, described above. As a result, the court stayed the matter pending final approval of the Ackerman proposed settlement. The Company and the plaintiff subsequently agreed to a lifting of the stay and a filing of an amended complaint in early November, and the Company removed the case to the United State District Court for the Eastern District of California on November 9, 2016. In the proposed First Amended Complaint, the plaintiff makes similar claims of Labor Code violations against the Company but does not seek to represent a putative class or make class action allegations. The Company disputes the allegations of the First Amended Complaint and, at this time, does not expect that this case will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition or results of operation. 
  On July 28, 2016, the Company was named as a defendant in Calleros v. Chico s FAS, Inc., a putative class action filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Barbara. Plaintiff alleges that the Company failed to comply with California law requiring it to provide consumers cash for gift cards with a stored value of less than $10.00. The Company believes that the matter is not appropriate for class treatment; however, it is not possible to predict whether it will be permitted to proceed as a class or the size of the putative class, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in its defense of this action on the merits or otherwise. Because class determinations have not been made, the Company is unable to estimate any potential loss or range of loss were it to lose on the merits of the case. However, the case is scheduled for voluntary mediation on November 28, 2016, and, at this time, the Company does not expect that the case will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial conditions or results of operation.  
  Other than as noted above, we are not currently a party to any legal proceedings other than claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. All such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes may not be predictable. Consequently, the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of   October 29, 2016   are not estimable. However, while such matters could affect our consolidated operating results when resolved in future periods, management believes that upon final disposition, any monetary liability or financial impact to us would not be material to our annual consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 

In addition to the other information discussed in this report, the factors described in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on   March 8, 2016   should be considered as they could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Other than as noted below, there have not been any significant changes with respect to the risks described in our   2015   Form 10-K, but these are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. 
    
  As discussed in Note 3 in our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are currently involved in significant strategic initiatives intended to increase the efficiency and productivity of our business processes. These initiatives require substantial internal change and effort, including reductions and changes in personnel and significant adjustments in how we design and source product and how we ultimately present it to our customers. While we are confident that these initiatives are appropriate for the long-term viability and success of our business, they may not deliver all of the results we expect. Moreover, the process of implementing them places significant stress on the company and could result in unexpected short-term disruptions or negative impacts to our business, including, by way of example: 
             
    Unintended loss of key personnel or unexpected delay in the hiring of personnel whose expertise is needed for the successful implementation of the initiatives. 
                
    Disruption to our current business processes as we migrate to the new processes, or failure to successfully migrate to those new processes, which could negatively impact product flow, product quality or inventory levels. 
                
    Inadvertent lapses or failures in our process, compliance or financial controls as we implement the new initiatives. 
       
  These negative impacts, or others, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, there is no assurance that we can complete the implementation of these initiatives in the manner or in the time-frame planned, or that, once implemented, they will result in the expected increases in the efficiency or productivity of our business. Failure to successfully implement them or their failure to produce the savings and productivity increases we anticipate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

The following table sets forth information concerning our purchases of common stock for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts): 

(a) Total number of shares purchased includes   59,165   shares of restricted stock repurchased in connection with employee tax withholding obligations under employee compensation plans, which are not purchases under any publicly announced plan. 
  (b) In November 2015, we announced a $300.0 million share repurchase plan. There was approximately   $183.7 million   remaining under the program as of the end of the   third   quarter. The repurchase program has no specific termination date and will expire when we have repurchased all securities authorized for repurchase thereunder, unless terminated earlier by our Board of Directors.

ITEM 5. 
    OTHER INFORMATION 

On November 17, 2016, the Company amended and restated the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") to add proxy access and to make other updates to the Bylaws (the  Amendments ), effective November 17, 2016. The Amendments include a new provisions Section 2.05 to the Bylaws that permits a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least 3% of the number of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company continuously for at least three years, to include in the Company s annual meeting proxy materials director nominees constituting up to 20% of the Board, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy certain notice and other requirements specified in the Bylaws. 
    
  The foregoing description of the Amendments does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, as amended, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 to this Form 10-Q.  
    
  On November 22, 2016, we announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share of its common stock, a 3.2% increase over the dividend rate from November 2015.

Section 6.      NOTICE OF ADJOURNED MEETING  .  Any meeting of the shareholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place (such reconvened meeting referred to herein as the  reconvened meeting ), and notice need not be given of the reconvened meeting if, prior to such adjournment, the new date, time or place thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which shareholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such reconvened meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, and any business may be transacted at the reconvened meeting that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting.  If, however, the Board fixes a new record date for the reconvened meeting or if a new record date for the reconvened meeting is required to be fixed under law, notice of the reconvened meeting must be given in compliance with Section 5 of this Article II to each shareholder of record on the new record date entitled to notice of and to vote at such reconvened meeting. 
    
  Section 7.      WAIVER OF CALL AND NOTICE OF MEETING  .  Notice of any meeting of shareholders may be waived by any shareholder before or after the date and time stated in the notice.  Such waiver must be in writing signed by the shareholder and delivered to the Corporation.  Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any special or annual meeting need be specified in such waiver.  A shareholder s attendance at a meeting (a) waives such shareholder s ability to object to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, and (b) waives such shareholder s ability to object to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose(s) described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented. 
    
  Section 8.      QUORUM  .  A majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the shareholders, unless the FBCA provides otherwise.  Shares of the Corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation or by any corporation of which the Corporation holds, directly or indirectly, a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation, shall not be counted for quorum purposes, except for shares held by it in a fiduciary capacity. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting (unless a new record date is or must be set for any reconvened meeting), and the subsequent withdrawal of shares or shareholders after a quorum has been established at a meeting shall not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. 
    
  Section 9.      ADJOURNMENT: QUORUM FOR RECONVENED MEETING  .  In the absence of a quorum, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Article II, Section 6 of these Bylaws.  At such reconvened meeting at which a quorum shall be present or deemed to be present in person or by proxy, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.

Except as otherwise provided by the Corporation s articles of incorporation ( Articles of Incorporation ) or the FBCA, action on all matters other than the election of directors shall be approved at a meeting where a quorum is present, in person or by proxy, if the votes cast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action by the holders of shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter thereof. 
    
  Section 11.      VOTING FOR DIRECTORS  .   Directors shall be elected as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation, as amended or restated from time to time. 
    
  Section 12.      VOTING LISTS  .  After fixing the record date for a meeting, an alphabetical list of the names of all shareholders entitled to notice of the meeting, arranged by voting group, with the address of and the number, class and series, if any, of shares held by each, shall be prepared by the Secretary.  The shareholders  list shall, upon written demand, be available during regular business hours, for inspection by any shareholder and at his or her expense for a period of ten (10) days prior to the meeting date, or such shorter time as may exist between the record date and the meeting, and continuing through the meeting, at the Corporation s principal office, at a place set forth in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held, or at the office of the Corporation s transfer agent or registrar.    The shareholders  list also shall be made available at the meeting and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.  The shareholders  list shall be prima facie evidence of the identity of shareholders entitled to examine  the shareholders  list or to vote at any meeting of the shareholders. 
    
  Section 13.      VOTING OF SHARES  .  Each shareholder entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy on each matter for each voting share held by such shareholder.  Such right to vote shall be subject to the right of the Board of Directors to close the transfer books or to fix a record date for voting shareholders as hereinafter provided. 
    
  Section 14.      PROXIES  . Every shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or his duly authorized attorney-in-fact, may vote in person or may authorize another person or persons to act for the shareholder by proxy. A proxy must be authorized by (a) a signed written appointment form, with a signature affixed, by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, facsimile or electronic signature, or (b) an electric transmission appearing to have been, or containing or accompanied by such information or obtained under such procedures to reasonably ensure that electronic transmission was, transmitted by the shareholder authorizing such proxy.  For these purposes, an electronic transmission includes, but is not limited to, telegrams, cablegrams, and transmissions through the internet. Any copy, facsimile transmission, or other reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or electronic transmission for any purposes for which the original writing or electronic transmission could be used if the copy, facsimile transmission or reproduction is a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or electronic transmission. Such proxy shall be filed with or transmitted to the Secretary, or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, before or at the time of such meeting.  No proxy shall be valid after eleven (11) months from the date of its execution, unless a  
  
   Revised November 17, 2016        Page  4 

longer period is expressly provided in the proxy.  A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A shareholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person, or by filing an instrument in writing with the Secretary revoking the proxy, or by giving a duly executed proxy bearing a later date.  If an appointment form expressly provides therefor, any proxy holder may appoint, in writing, a substitute to act in his or her place. 
    
  Section 15.      NO ACTION BY SHAREHOLDERS WITHOUT A MEETING  .  Any action requiring or permitting a vote of the shareholders must be taken at an annual or special meeting of shareholders duly called in accordance with the terms of this Article II, and may not be taken by the written consent of shareholders.   
    
  Section 16.    ORGANIZATION AND CONDUCT OF BUSINESS  .  The Chair of the Board of Directors, if any, or in his or her absence, the CEO, if any, or in his or her absence, the President, if any, or in his or her absence, a Vice President, if any, or in his or her absence, such person designated by the Board, or in the absence of such designation, such person as may  be chosen by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting and who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of shareholders and act as chair of the meeting.  The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chair of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. The chair of any meeting of shareholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seems to him or her to be in order.  The date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which shareholders will vote at the meeting shall be announced at the meeting. 
    
  Section 17.      INSPECTORS  .  For each meeting of the shareholders, the Board of Directors, the CEO or the President may appoint two inspectors to supervise the voting; and, if inspectors are so appointed, all questions respecting the qualification of any vote, the validity of any proxy, and the acceptance or rejection of any vote shall be decided by such inspectors.  Before acting at any meeting, the inspectors shall take an oath to execute their duties with strict impartiality and according to the best of their ability.  If any inspector shall fail to be present or shall decline to act, the CEO or the President shall appoint another inspector to act in his or her place.  In case of a tie vote by the inspectors on any question, the presiding officer shall decide the issue. 
    
  Section 18.      PROXY ACCESS  .

Any director may waive notice of any meeting, either before, at or after such meeting.  The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and so states at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon arrival at the meeting.

removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person removed.  Directors may not be removed by the shareholders without cause.   
    
  Section 12.      VACANCIES  .  If any vacancy occurs on the Board of Directors, including any vacancy created by reason of an increase in the number of directors of the Corporation, such vacancy may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, or by a sole remaining director, or by the shareholders, unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation.

  Section 14.      PRESUMPTION OF ASSENT  .  A director of the Corporation who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which action on any corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless such director objects at the beginning of the meeting (or promptly upon his arrival) to the holding of the meeting or the transacting of specified business at the meeting or such director votes against such action or abstains from voting in respect of such matter. 
    
  Section 15.      INFORMAL ACTION BY BOARD  .  Any action required or permitted to be taken by any provision of law, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if each and every member of the Board or of such committee, as the case may be, consents thereto and the action taken is evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken signed by each director. Such written consent or consents shall be filed in the minutes of the proceedings of the Board or any such committee, as the case may be.  A written consent of a director may be signed with an electronic signature adopted by such consenting director with the intent to authenticate the written consent. Action taken under this section is effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the consent specifies a different effective date, in which case it is effective on the date so specified. A consent so signed has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document.  
    
  Section 16.      MEETING BY TELEPHONE, ETC  .  Directors or the members of any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or of any such committee, as the case may be, through the use of any means of communication by which all directors participating in the meeting may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting (including, without limitation, by means of a conference telephone, video phone, webcast, web conference, or similar communications equipment).

Each officer shall hold office until such officer s successor shall have been duly appointed and shall have qualified, unless such officer sooner dies, resigns or is removed by the Board or by the CEO.

Any officer or assistant officer, if appointed by another officer, may likewise be removed by the officer who so appointed them or by the Board of Directors or the CEO.  Election or appointment of an officer or agent shall not of itself create contract rights.

  Section 7.      SALARIES  .  The salaries and other compensation of the officers shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors, and no officer shall be prevented from receiving a salary or other compensation by reason of the fact, in and of itself, that the officer is also a director of the Corporation. 
    
  Section 8.      DELEGATION OF DUTIES  .  In the absence or disability of any officer of the Corporation or for any other reason deemed sufficient by the Board of Directors, the Board may delegate the powers or duties of such officer to any other officer or to any director for the time being.  In the absence or disability of any officer of the Corporation appointed by the CEO or for any other reason deemed sufficient by the CEO, the CEO may delegate the powers or duties of any such officer appointed by the CEO to any other officer or to any director for the time being.

office; (d) each acting officer so appointed shall be entitled to exercise all powers invested by law, the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws and the Board in the office in which such person is serving; and (e) anyone transacting business with the Corporation may rely upon a certificate signed by any two officers of the Corporation that a specified individual has succeeded to the powers and duties of the CEO or such other specified office.

  Indemnification of Directors and Officers 
    
  Section 1.      GENERAL  .   
    
  (a)    To the fullest extent permitted by law from time to time, and consistent with the principles set forth in Section 1(b) below, the Corporation shall be entitled but not obligated to indemnify any person who is or was a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or other type of proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise, and whether formal or informal, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. 
    
  (b)    Any person for whom indemnification is authorized under Section 1(a) above shall be indemnified against all liabilities, judgments, amounts paid in settlement, penalties, and fines (including attorneys  fees and court costs) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any such action, suit or other proceeding, including any appeal thereof.  Indemnification shall be available only if the person to be indemnified acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person s conduct was unlawful.  The termination of any such action, suit or other proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person s conduct was unlawful. 

Section 2.      ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION  . 
    
  (a)  To the fullest extent permitted by law from time to time, and consistent with the principles set forth in Section 2(b) below the Corporation shall be entitled but not obligated to indemnify any person who is or was a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or other type of proceeding (as further described in Section 1 of this Article VI) by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. 
    
  (b)  Any person for whom indemnification is authorized under Section 2(a) above shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys  fees and court costs) and amounts paid in settlement not exceeding, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, the estimated expenses of litigating the action, suit or other proceeding to conclusion, that are actually and reasonably incurred  
  
   Revised November 17, 2016        Page  18 

in connection with the defense or settlement of such action, suit or other proceeding, including any appeal thereof.  Indemnification shall be available only if the person to be indemnified acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no indemnification shall be made under this Section 2 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable unless, and only to the extent that, the court in which such action, suit or other proceeding was brought, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such expenses that such court shall deem proper. 
    
  Section 3.      OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY  .  To the extent that a director or officer has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or other proceeding referred to in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VI, or in the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall, upon application, be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys  fees and court costs) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. 
    
  Section 4.      DETERMINATION THAT INDEMNIFICATION IS PROPER  .  Indemnification pursuant to Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VI, unless made under the provisions of Section 3 of this Article VI or unless otherwise made pursuant to a determination by a court, shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that the indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the indemnified person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VI.  Such determination shall be made under one of the following procedures: 
    
  (a)    by the Board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or other proceeding to which the indemnification relates; 
    
  (b)    if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, by majority vote of a committee duly designated by the Board of Directors (the designation being one in which directors who are parties may participate) consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to such action, suit or other proceeding; 
    
  (c)    by independent legal counsel (i) selected by the Board of Directors in accordance with the requirements of subsection (a) or by a committee designated under subsection (b) or (ii) if a quorum of the directors cannot be obtained and a committee cannot be designated, selected by majority vote of the full Board of Directors (the vote being one in which directors who are parties may participate); or 
    
  (d)    by the shareholders of the Corporation by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of shareholders who were not parties to such action, suit or other proceeding or, if no such quorum is obtainable, by a majority vote of shareholders who were not parties to such action, suit or other proceeding. 

Revised November 17, 2016        Page  19 

Section 5.      EVALUATION AND AUTHORIZATION  .  Evaluation of the reasonableness of expenses and authorization of indemnification shall be made in the same manner as is prescribed in Section 4 of this Article VI for the determination that indemnification is permissible; provided, however, that if the determination as to whether indemnification is permissible is made by independent legal counsel, the persons who selected such independent legal counsel shall be responsible for evaluating the reasonableness of expenses and may authorize indemnification. 
    
  Section 6.      PREPAYMENT OF EXPENSES  .  Expenses (including attorneys  fees and court costs) incurred by a director or officer in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or other proceeding referred to in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VI may, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition thereof.  Any such payment shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if such person is ultimately found not to be entitled to indemnification by the Corporation pursuant to this Article VI. 
    
  Section 7.      NON-EXCLUSIVITY AND LIMITATIONS  .  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided pursuant to this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person may be entitled under any law, bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in such person s official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office with the Corporation.  Such indemnification and advancement of expenses shall continue as to any person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of such person s heirs and personal representatives.  The Board of Directors may, at any time, approve indemnification of or advancement of expenses to any other person that the Corporation has the power by law to indemnify, including, without limitation, employees and agents of the Corporation.  In all cases not specifically provided for in this Article VI, indemnification or advancement of expenses shall not be made to the extent that such indemnification or advancement of expenses is expressly prohibited by law. 

Section 8.      CONTINUATION OF INDEMNIFICATION RIGHT  . 
    
  (a)  Unless expressly otherwise provided when authorized or ratified by this Corporation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as provided for in this Article VI shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such person. 
    
  (b)  For purposes of this Article VI, the term  Corporation  includes, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of a constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of a constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, is in the same position under this Article VI with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have been with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

  ARTICLE VII 
    
  Interested Parties 
    
  Section 1.      GENERAL  .  No contract or other transaction between the Corporation and any one or more of its directors or any other corporation, firm, association or entity in which one or more of its directors are directors or officers or are financially interested shall be either void or voidable because of such relationship or interest, because such director or directors were present at the meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies such contract or transaction or because such director s or directors  votes are counted for such purpose if: (a) the fact of such relationship or interest is disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or committee which authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction by a vote or consent sufficient for the purpose without counting the votes or consents of such interested directors; (b) the fact of such relationship or interest is disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote on the matter, and they authorize, approve or ratify such contract or transaction by vote or written consent; or (c) the contract or transaction is fair and reasonable as to the Corporation at the time it is authorized by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the shareholders. 

Section 2.      APPROVAL BY DIRECTORS OR COMMITTEES  .    For purposes of Section 1(a) of this Article VII, a conflict of interest transaction shall be authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the Board of Directors, or on the committee, who have no relationship or interest in the transaction described in Section 1 of this Article VII, but a transaction may not be authorized, approved, or ratified under this Section by a single director.  If a majority of the directors who have no such relationship or interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under Section 1(a) of this Article VII.  The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with such relationship or interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under Section 1(a) of this Article VII if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved, or ratified as provided in Section 1(a) of this Article VII, but such presence or vote of those directors may be counted for purposes of determining whether the transaction is approved under other applicable law. 
    
  Section 3.      APPROVAL BY SHAREHOLDERS  .  For purposes of Section 1(b) of this Article VII, a conflict of interest transaction shall be authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the shares entitled to be counted under this Section 3.  Shares owned by or voted under the control of a director who has a relationship or interest in the transaction described in Section 1 of this Article VII may not be counted in a vote of shareholders to determine whether  
  
   Revised November 17, 2016        Page  21 

to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under Section 1(b) of this Article VII.  The vote of the shares owned by or voted under the control of a director who has a relationship or interest in the transaction described in Section 1 of this Article VII, shall be counted, however, in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of these  Bylaws and applicable law.  A majority of those shares that would be entitled, if present, to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this Section 3 shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this Section 3. 
    
  ARTICLE VIII 
    
  Certificates of Shares 
    
  Section 1.      CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES  . Shares shall either be represented by certificates or shall be uncertificated and represented by book entry registered in the name of the shareholder on the books and records of the Corporation or its transfer agent.  At the direction of the Corporation to its transfer agent and absent a specific request for a certificate by the registered shareholder or transferee thereof, all shares of the Corporation shall be in uncertificated, book entry form upon the original issuance thereof by the Corporation or upon the surrender of the certificate representing such shares to the Corporation, in accordance with a Direct Registration System approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission and by the New York Stock Exchange or any securities exchange on which the share of the Corporation may from time to time be traded. 

The rights and obligations of shareholders of the Corporation shall be identical whether or not their shares are represented by certificates.  If shares are represented by certificates, each certificate shall be in such form as the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe, signed (either manually or in facsimile) by the President or a Vice President (and may be signed (either manually or in facsimile) by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary and sealed with the seal of the Corporation or its facsimile), exhibiting the holder s name, certifying the number of shares owned and stating such other matters as may be required by law.  The certificates shall be numbered and entered on the books of the Corporation as they are issued.  If shares are not represented by certificates, then, within a reasonable time after issue or transfer of shares without certificates, the Corporation shall send the shareholder a written statement in such form as the Board may from time to time prescribe, certifying as to the number of shares owned by the shareholder and as to such other information as would have been required to be on certificates for such shares. 
    
  If and to the extent the Corporation is authorized to issue shares of more than one class or more than one series of any class, every certificate representing shares shall set forth or fairly summarize upon the face or back of the certificate, or shall state that the Corporation will furnish to any shareholder upon request and without charge a full statement of: 
    
  (a)  The designations, relative rights, preferences and limitations of the shares of each class or series authorized to be issued. 

Revised November 17, 2016        Page  22 

(b)  The variations in rights, preferences and limitations between the shares of each such series, if the Corporation is authorized to issue any preferred or special class in series insofar as the same have been fixed and determined. 
    
  (c)    The authority of the Board to fix and determine the variations, relative rights and preferences of future series. 
    
  Section 2.      SIGNATURES OF PAST OFFICERS  .  If the person who signed (either manually or in facsimile) a share certificate no longer holds office when the certificate is issued, the certificate shall nevertheless be valid. 
    
  Section 3.      TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS  .  The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, appoint responsible banks or trust companies in such city or cities as the Board may deem advisable from time to time to act as transfer agents and registrars of the shares of the Corporation; and, when such appointments shall have been made, no share certificate shall be valid until countersigned by one of such transfer agents and registered by one of such registrars.

Furthermore, in no event shall employment be deemed terminated under this Restricted Stock Agreement unless and until Employee s employment by Company, to the extent applicable, and each of its subsidiaries, to the extent applicable, occur such that the Employee is no longer employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

If a Change in Control shall occur, then all nonvested Restricted Stock shall fully vest, all restrictions (other than those described in Paragraph 12) applicable to such Restricted Stock shall terminate and the Company shall release from escrow or trust and shall issue and electronically transfer to the Employee all shares of Restricted Stock, but only if either: (i) the successor company does not assume, convert, continue, or otherwise replace the Restricted Stock on proportionate and equitable terms or (ii) the Employee is terminated without cause within twelve (12) months following the Change in Control.

Neither the transfer of the Employee from employment by the Company to employment by a subsidiary, nor the transfer of the Employee from employment by a subsidiary to employment by the Company, nor the transfer of the Employee from employment by a subsidiary to employment by another subsidiary shall be deemed to be a termination of employment of the Employee.  Furthermore, in no event shall employment be deemed terminated under this Restricted Stock Agreement unless and until Employee s employment by Company, to the extent applicable, and each of its subsidiaries, to the extent applicable, occur such that the Employee is no longer employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.  Moreover, the employment of the Employee shall not be deemed terminated because of absence from active employment on account of temporary illness or during authorized vacation or during temporary leaves of absence from active employment granted by the Company or a subsidiary for reasons of professional advancement, education, health, or government service, or during military leave for any period if the Employee returns to active employment within 90 days after the termination of military leave, or during any period required to be treated as a leave of absence by virtue of any valid law or agreement.  The Plan Administrator s determination in good faith regarding whether a termination of employment of any type or Disability has occurred shall be conclusive and determinative.  
  9.        Ownership Rights  .  Subject to the restrictions set forth herein and subject to Paragraph 12, the Employee is entitled to all voting and ownership rights applicable to the Restricted

  10.        Reorganization of Company and Subsidiaries  .  The existence of this Restricted Stock Agreement shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company or its stockholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in the Company s capital structure or its business, or any merger or consolidation of the Company or any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Restricted Stock or the rights thereof, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.

No amendment or termination of this Restricted Stock Agreement which would impair the rights of the Employee shall be made by the Board, the Committee or the Plan Administrator at any time without the written consent of the Employee.

The Company shall have the right to (i) make deductions from the number of shares of Restricted Stock otherwise deliverable upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent under this Restricted Stock Agreement (and other amounts payable under this Restricted Stock Agreement) in an amount sufficient to satisfy withholding of any federal, state or local taxes required by law, or (ii) take such other action as may be necessary or appropriate to satisfy any such tax withholding obligations, provided, in any event, the Company shall withhold only the minimum amount necessary to satisfy applicable statutory withholding requirements. 
  20.        No Guarantee of Tax Consequences  .  Neither the Company nor any subsidiary nor the Plan Administrator makes any commitment or guarantee that any federal or state tax treatment will apply or be available to any person eligible for benefits under this Restricted Stock Agreement.
