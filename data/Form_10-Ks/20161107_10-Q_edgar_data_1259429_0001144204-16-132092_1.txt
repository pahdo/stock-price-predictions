 TICC CAPITAL CORP.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  (unaudited)  

 NOTE 1. UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

   Interim consolidated financial statements of TICC Capital Corp. ( TICC  and, together with its subsidiaries, the  Company ) are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are omitted. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for the fair statement of
consolidated financial results for the interim periods have been included. The current period s consolidated results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for the year. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  

 NOTE 2. ORGANIZATION  

 TICC was incorporated under the General Corporation Laws of the State of Maryland on July 21, 2003 and is a non-diversified, closed-end investment company. TICC has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ). In addition, TICC has elected to be treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company ( RIC ), under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). The Company s investment objective is to maximize its total return, by investing primarily in
corporate debt securities.  

 TICC s investment activities are managed by TICC Management, LLC ( TICC Management ), a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. BDC Partners, LLC ( BDC Partners ) is the managing member of TICC Management and serves as the administrator of TICC.  

 The Company s consolidated operations include the activities of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, TICC CLO 2012-1 LLC ( 2012 Securitization Issuer  or  TICC CLO 2012-1 ) and TICC Funding, LLC ( TICC Funding ) for the periods during which they were held. These subsidiaries were formed for the purpose of enabling the Company to obtain debt financing and are operated solely for the investment activities of the Company, and the Company has substantial equity at risk. TICC Funding was formed on September 17, 2014, for the purpose of entering into a credit and security agreement with Citibank, N.A.
(the  Facility ). During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company liquidated portions of the TICC Funding portfolio and, as of December 31, 2015, the Facility had been fully repaid. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company, as collateral manager of TICC Funding, dissolved TICC Funding pursuant to Delaware law by filing a certificate of cancellation with the Secretary of State in Delaware. See  Note 7. Borrowings  for additional information on the Company s subsidiaries and their borrowings.  

 NOTE 3. CHANGE OF ACCOUNTING FOR COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATION EQUITY INVESTMENT INCOME  

 During the first quarter of 2015, the Company identified a non-material error in its accounting for income from Collateralized Loan Obligation ( CLO ) equity investments. The Company had recorded income from its CLO equity investments using the dividend recognition model as described in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 946-320; specifically, dividends were recognized on the applicable record date, subject to estimation and collectability, with a reduction to cost basis in those instances where the Company believed that a return of capital had occurred. The Company has determined that the
appropriate method for recording investment income on CLO equity investments is the effective yield method as described in ASC 325-40,  Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets . This method requires the calculation of an effective yield to expected redemption based upon an estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows, including recurring cash flows as well as future principal repayments; the difference between the actual cash received

 NOTE 3. CHANGE OF ACCOUNTING FOR COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATION EQUITY INVESTMENT INCOME    (continued) 

 (and record date distributions to be received) and the effective yield income calculation is an adjustment to cost. The effective yield is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as appropriate.  

 The difference between the two methods resulted in an income reclassification error which would generally have resulted in a decrease in total investment income with a corresponding and offsetting increase to net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments and net realized gains/losses on investments. The Company quantified this error and assessed it in accordance with the guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) 108,  Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements . Based on this assessment, the Company
concluded that the error in income classification did not have a material impact on the Company s previously filed consolidated financial statements.  

 As a result of this misclassification of income, net investment income incentive fees were overstated by approximately $2.4 million on a cumulative basis through 2014 and, as a result, total net assets as of December 31, 2014 were understated by the same amount, approximately $0.04 per share. The Company also considered this indirect impact of the error in classification and concluded that the error was not material to the Company s previously filed consolidated financial statements. The error was corrected by an out-of-period adjustment in the first quarter of 2015, reducing net investment income incentive fees by
approximately $2.4 million and recognizing a corresponding  due from affiliate  of $2.4 million. TICC Management repaid in full to TICC, on April 30, 2015, the portion of its previously paid net investment income incentive fees attributable to the overstated amounts.  

 Prospectively as of January 1, 2015, the Company records income from its CLO equity investments using the effective yield method in accordance with the accounting guidance in ASC 325-40, based upon an effective yield to the expected redemption utilizing estimated cash flows.  

 NOTE 4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

 BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, TICC CLO 2012-1 and TICC Funding. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

 Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.  

 The Company follows the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC 946,  Financial Services   Investment Companies.   

 USE OF ESTIMATES  

 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.  

 In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations and provide indemnifications. The Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. However, based upon experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.

 NOTE 4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    (continued) 

 CONSOLIDATION  

 As provided under Regulation S-X and ASC Topic 946-810,  Consolidation,  the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than a wholly-owned investment company or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. TICC CLO 2012-1 and TICC Funding would be considered investment companies but for the exceptions under Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) under the 1940 Act, and were established solely for the purpose of allowing the Company to borrow funds for the purpose of making investments. The Company owns all of the equity in these entities and controls the
decision-making power that drives their economic performance. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the results of its wholly-owned subsidiaries in its financial statements, and follows the accounting and reporting guidance in ASC 946-810.  

 In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.  The new guidance applies to entities in all industries and provides a new scope exception to registered money market funds and similar unregistered money market funds. It makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the VIE guidance. ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have
a material effect on the Company s consolidated results of operation and financial condition.  

 CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  

 Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and highly liquid investments, such as money market funds, with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost or amortized cost, which approximates fair value.  

 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, restricted cash represents the cash held by the trustee of the 2012 Securitization Issuer. These amounts are held by the trustee for payment of interest expense and operating expenses of the entity, principal repayments on borrowings, or new investments, based upon the terms of the indenture, and are not available for general corporate purposes.  

 INVESTMENT VALUATION  

 The Company fair values its investment portfolio in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure . Estimates made in the preparation of TICC s consolidated financial statements include the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded. TICC believes that there is no single definitive method for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied
valuation process for the types of investments TICC makes.  

 ASC 820-10 clarified the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active
markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities in markets that are not active; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. TICC considers the attributes of current market conditions on an ongoing basis and has determined that due to the general

 TICC CAPITAL CORP.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  (unaudited)  

 NOTE 4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    (continued) 

 illiquidity of the market for its investment portfolio, whereby little or no market data exists, almost all of TICC s investments are based upon  Level 3  inputs as of September 30, 2016.  

 TICC s Board of Directors determines the value of its investment portfolio each quarter. In connection with that determination, members of TICC Management s portfolio management team prepare a quarterly analysis of each portfolio investment using the most recent portfolio company financial statements, forecasts and other relevant financial and operational information. Since March 2004, TICC has engaged third-party valuation firms to provide assistance in valuing certain of its syndicated loans and bilateral investments, including related equity investments, although TICC s Board of Directors ultimately
determines the appropriate valuation of each such investment. Changes in fair value, as described above, are recorded in the statement of operations as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation.  

 Syndicated Loans  

 In accordance with ASC 820-10, TICC s valuation procedures specifically provide for the review of indicative quotes supplied by the large agent banks that make a market for each security. However, the marketplace from which TICC obtains indicative bid quotes for purposes of determining the fair value of its syndicated loan investments has shown attributes of illiquidity as described by ASC-820-10. During such periods of illiquidity, when TICC believes that the non-binding indicative bids received from agent banks for certain syndicated investments that the Company owns may not be determinative of their fair value or when
no market indicative quote is available, TICC may engage third-party valuation firms to provide assistance in valuing certain syndicated investments that TICC owns. In addition, TICC Management prepares an analysis of each syndicated loan, financial summary, covenant compliance review, recent trading activity in the security, if known, and other business developments related to the portfolio company. All available information, including non-binding indicative bids which may not be determinative of fair value, is presented to the Valuation Committee to consider in its determination of fair value. In some instances, there may be limited trading activity in a security even though the market for the security is considered not active. In such cases the Valuation Committee will consider the number of trades, the size and timing of each trade, and other circumstances around such trades, to the extent such information is available, in its determination of fair value. The Valuation Committee
will evaluate the impact of such additional information, and factor it into its consideration of the fair value that is indicated by the analysis provided by third-party valuation firms, if any.  

 Collateralized Loan Obligations   Debt and Equity  

 During the past six years, TICC has acquired a number of debt and equity positions in CLO investment vehicles and, more recently, CLO warehouse investments. These investments are special purpose financing vehicles. In valuing such investments, TICC considers the indicative prices provided by a recognized industry pricing service as a primary source, and the implied yield of such prices, supplemented by actual trades executed in the market at or around period-end, as well as the indicative prices provided by the broker who arranges transactions in such investment vehicles. TICC also considers those instances in which the record
date for an equity distribution payment falls on the last day of the period, and the likelihood that a prospective purchaser would require a downward adjustment to the indicative price representing substantially all of the pending distribution. Additional factors include any available information on other relevant transactions including firm bids and offers in the market and information resulting from bids-wanted-in-competition. In addition, TICC considers the operating metrics of the specific investment vehicle, including compliance with collateralization tests, defaulted and restructured securities, and payment defaults, if any. TICC Management or the Valuation Committee may request an additional analysis by a third-party firm to assist in the valuation process of CLO investment vehicles. All information is presented to TICC s Board of Directors for its determination of fair value of these investments.

 Bilateral Investments (Including Equity)  

 Bilateral investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued by an independent pricing agent or market maker. If such market quotations are not readily available, under the valuation procedures approved by TICC s Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Valuation Committee, a third-party valuation firm will prepare valuations for each of TICC s bilateral investments that, when combined with all other investments in the same portfolio company, (i) have a value as of the previous quarter of greater than or equal to 2.5% of its total assets as of the previous quarter, and (ii) have a
value as of the current quarter of greater than or equal to 2.5% of its total assets as of the previous quarter, after taking into account any repayment of principal during the current quarter. In addition, in those instances where a third-party valuation is prepared for a portfolio investment which meets the parameters noted in (i) and (ii) above, the frequency of those third-party valuations is based upon the grade assigned to each such security under its credit grading system as follows: Grade 1, at least annually; Grade 2, at least semi-annually; Grades 3, 4, and 5, at least quarterly. Bilateral investments which do not meet the parameters in (i) and (ii) above are not required to have a third-party valuation and, in those instances, a valuation analysis will be prepared by TICC Management. TICC Management also retains the authority to seek, on TICC s behalf, additional third party valuations with respect to both TICC s bilateral portfolio securities and TICC s
syndicated loan investments. TICC s Board of Directors retains ultimate authority as to the third-party review cycle as well as the appropriate valuation of each investment.  

 INVESTMENT INCOME  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis using the contractual rate applicable to each debt investment and includes the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums. Discounts from and premiums to par value on securities purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, if any.  

 Generally, when interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if the Company otherwise does not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, the Company will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. The Company generally restores non-accrual loans to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in the Company s
judgment, is likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had no investments that were on a non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2015 the Company s investment in RBS Holding Company second lien senior secured notes was on non-accrual status.  

 In addition, the Company earns income from the discount on debt securities it purchases, including original issue discount ( OID ) and market discount. OID and market discounts are capitalized and amortized into income using the interest method, as applicable.  

 Income from Securitization Vehicles and Equity Investments  

 Income from investments in the equity class securities of CLO vehicles (typically income notes or subordinated notes) is recorded using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC 325-40, based upon an effective yield to the expected redemption utilizing estimated cash flows, including those CLO equity investments that have not made their inaugural distribution for the relevant period end. The Company monitors the expected residual payments, and effective yield is determined and updated

 periodically, as needed. Accordingly, investment income recognized on CLO equity securities in the GAAP statement of operations differs from both the tax-basis investment income and from the cash distributions actually received by the Company during the period.  

 Payment-In-Kind  

 TICC has investments in its portfolio which contain a contractual payment-in-kind ( PIK ) provision. Certain PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or additional securities. PIK interest computed at the contractual rate is accrued into income and added to the principal balance on the capitalization date. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored to accrual status once it becomes probable that PIK will be realized. To maintain its status as a RIC, this
income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions, even though TICC has not collected any cash. Amounts necessary to pay these distributions may come from available cash or the liquidation of certain investments.  

 Other Income  

 Other income includes distributions from fee letters and success fees associated with portfolio investments. Distributions from fee letters are an enhancement to the return on a CLO equity investment, based upon a percentage of the collateral manager s fees, and are recorded as other income when earned. The Company may also earn success fees associated with its investments in certain securitization vehicles or  CLO warehouse facilities,  which are contingent upon a repayment of the warehouse by a permanent CLO securitization structure; such fees are earned and recognized when the repayment is completed.  

 DEFERRED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS  

 Deferred debt issuance costs consist of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the closing or amending of credit facilities and debt offerings, and are capitalized at the time of payment. These costs are amortized using the straight line method over the terms of the respective credit facilities and debt securities. This amortization expense is included in interest expense in the Company s financial statements. Upon early termination of debt, or a credit facility, the remaining balance of unamortized fees related to such debt is accelerated into interest expense. Deferred offering costs are presented on the balance
sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability.  

 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ). The new guidance requires debt issuance costs (deferred financing costs) related to a recognized debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts. Additionally, in August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-15,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent
Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  ( ASU 2015-15 ), which codifies an SEC staff announcement that entities are permitted to defer and present debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements as assets and subsequent amortization of the deferred costs over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-03 and 2015-15 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 and 2015-15 did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated results of operation and financial condition; however, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the adoption of ASU 2015-03 did result in the reclassification of approximately $2.7 million and approximately $3.8 million, respectively, in deferred debt issuance costs which post-adoption are a
direct deduction from the related debt liability. The December 31, 2015 balances have been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application, as required by ASU 2015-03.

 NOTE 4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    (continued) 

 EQUITY OFFERING COSTS  

 Equity offering costs consist of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration and public offer and sale of the Company s common stock, including legal, accounting and printing fees. These costs are deferred at the time of incurrence and are subsequently charged to capital when the offering takes place or as shares are issued. Deferred costs are periodically reviewed and expensed if the related registration is no longer active.  

 SHARE REPURCHASES  

 From time to time, the Company s Board of Directors may authorize a share repurchase program under which shares are purchased in open market transactions. Since the Company is incorporated in the State of Maryland, state law requires share repurchases to be accounted for as a share retirement. The cost of repurchased shares is charged against capital on the settlement date.  

 OTHER ASSETS  

 Other assets consists of funds held in escrow from sales of investments, prepaid expenses associated primarily with insurance and deferred equity offering costs. At September 30, 2016, funds held in escrow totaled approximately $740,000, related to the sale of the Company s investment in Ai Squared during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The funds are expected to be released during the fourth quarter of 2017, net of settlement of any indemnity claims and expenses related to the transaction.  

 U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES  

 The Company intends to operate so as to qualify to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and, as such, to not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable income and gains distributed to stockholders. To qualify for RIC tax treatment, TICC is required to distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income annually, meet asset diversification requirements quarterly and file Form 1120-RIC, as defined by the Code.  

 Because U.S. federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. Differences in classification may also result from the treatment of short-term gains as ordinary income for tax purposes.  

 For tax purposes, the cost basis of the portfolio investments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was $722,130,010 and $830,119,903, respectively.

Significant Unobservable Inputs for Level 3 Investments  

 The following tables provide quantitative information about the Company s Level 3 fair value measurements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company s valuation policy, as described above, establishes parameters for the sources and types of valuation analysis, as well as the methodologies and inputs that the Company uses in determining fair value. If the Valuation Committee or TICC Management determines that additional techniques, sources or inputs are appropriate or necessary in a given situation, such additional work will be undertaken. The tables, therefore, are not all-inclusive,
but provide information on the significant Level 3 inputs that are pertinent to the Company s fair value measurements. The weighted average calculations in the table below are based on principal balances for all debt related calculations and CLO equity.

(1) 

           The Company generally uses prices provided by an independent pricing service, or broker or agent bank non-binding indicative bid prices ( NBIB ) on or near the valuation date as the primary basis for the fair value determinations for syndicated notes, and CLO debt and equity investments, which may be adjusted for pending equity distributions as of valuation date. These bid prices are non-binding, and may not be determinative of fair value. Each bid price is evaluated by the Valuation Committee in conjunction with additional information compiled by TICC Management, including financial performance, recent business developments, and, in the case of CLO debt and equity investments, performance and covenant compliance information as provided by the independent trustee.

           The Company will calculate the fair value of certain CLO equity investments based upon the net present value of expected contractual payment streams discounted using estimated market yields for the equity tranche of the respective CLO vehicle. TICC will also consider those investments in which the record date for an equity distribution payment falls on the last day of the period, and the likelihood that a prospective purchaser would require an adjustment to the transaction price representing substantially all of the pending distribution.

           Prices provided by independent pricing services are evaluated in conjunction with actual trades and payoffs and, in certain cases, the value represented by actual trades or payoffs may be more representative of fair value as determined by the Valuation Committee.

           For TICC s debt and equity investments, third-party valuation firms evaluate the financial and operational information of the portfolio companies that TICC provides to them, as well as independent market and industry information that they consider appropriate in forming an opinion as to the fair value of its securities. In those instances where the carrying value and/or internal credit rating of the investment does not require the use of a third-party valuation firm, a valuation is prepared by TICC Management, which may include liquidation analysis or which may utilize a subsequent transaction to provide an indication of fair value.

 Debt Securitization  

 Notes Payable   TICC CLO 2012-1 LLC  

 On August 23, 2012, the Company completed a $160 million debt securitization financing transaction, consisting of $120 million in secured notes and $40 million of the 2012 Subordinated Notes. On February 25, 2013 and May 28, 2013, TICC CLO 2012-1 issued additional secured notes totaling an aggregate of $120 million and 2012 Subordinated Notes totaling an aggregate of $40 million, which 2012 Subordinated Notes were purchased by TICC under the  accordion  feature of the debt securitization which allowed, under certain circumstances and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, for an increase in the amount of
secured and subordinated notes. It is not necessary that the Company own all or any of the notes permitted by this feature, which may affect the accounting treatment of the debt securitization financing transaction. On August 25, 2016, the Securitization Issuer repaid $36.0 million of the class A-1 notes. As of September 30, 2016, the secured notes of the 2012 Securitization Issuer have an aggregate face amount of $204 million and were issued in four classes. The class A-1 notes have a current face amount of $140 million, are rated AAA  (sf) /Aaa  (sf)  by Standard   Poor s Ratings Services (S P) and Moody s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s), respectively, and bear interest at three-month London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR ) plus 1.75%. The class B-1 notes have a current face amount of $20 million, are rated AAA  (sf) /Aa1  (sf)  by S P and Moody s, respectively, and bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 3.50%. The
class C-1 notes have a current face amount of $23 million, are rated AA+  (sf) /A1  (sf)  by S P and Moody s, respectively, and bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 4.75%. The class D-1 notes have a current face amount of $21 million, are rated A+  (sf) /Baa1  (sf)  by S P and Moody s, respectively, and bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 5.75%. TICC presently owns all of the 2012 Subordinated Notes, which totaled $80 million as of September 30, 2016.  

 In connection with the redemption of $36.0 million, the Company incurred debt extinguishment costs of approximately $648,000, which consisted of approximately $287,000 in accelerated note discount expense and approximately $361,000 in accelerated deferred debt issuance costs.  

 During a period of up to four years from the closing date, all principal collections received on the underlying collateral may be used by the 2012 Securitization Issuer to purchase new collateral under the Company s direction in its capacity as collateral manager of the 2012 Securitization Issuer and in accordance with its investment strategy, allowing the Company to maintain the initial leverage in the securitization for such four-year period. All note classes are scheduled to mature on August 25, 2023.  

 The proceeds of the private placement of the Classes A, B, C, D and 2012 Subordinated Notes of the 2012 Securitization Issuer, net of discount and debt issuance costs, were used for investment purposes. As part of the securitization, the Company entered into a master loan sale agreement with TICC CLO 2012-1 pursuant to which it agreed to sell or contribute certain senior secured and second lien loans (or participation interests therein) to TICC CLO 2012-1, and to purchase or otherwise acquire the 2012 Subordinated Notes. The Classes A, B, C, D and 2012 Subordinated Notes of the 2012 Securitization Issuer are the secured
obligations of TICC CLO 2012-1, and an indenture governing the notes of the 2012 Securitization Issuer includes customary covenants and events of default.

 May 1, 2013. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of TICC s common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 87.2448 shares of its common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $11.46 per share of common stock. The conversion price for the Convertible Notes will be reduced for quarterly cash distributions paid to common shares to the extent that the quarterly distribution exceeds $0.29 cents per share, subject to adjustment. The Convertible Notes mature on November 1, 2017, unless previously converted in accordance with
their terms. TICC does not have the right to redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. The aggregate accrued interest payable on the Convertible Notes at September 30, 2016 was approximately $3.6 million. Deferred debt issuance costs represent fees and other direct incremental costs incurred in connection with the Convertible Notes. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a deferred debt issuance balance of approximately $0.7 million. This amount is being amortized and is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the term of the Convertible Notes.  

 The following table sets forth the components of interest expense, effective annualized average interest rates and cash paid for interest of the Convertible Notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:  

In certain circumstances, the Convertible Notes will be convertible into shares of TICC s common stock at its initial conversion rate (listed below) subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments and the requirements of its indenture, at any time on or prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. The Company will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares.  

As of September 30, 2016, the principal amount of the Convertible Notes exceeded the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of the Company s common stock.  

 The Convertible Notes are TICC s general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of TICC s existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of its subordinated indebtedness. As a result, the Convertible Notes will be effectively subordinated to TICC s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to any existing and future liabilities and other indebtedness of its subsidiaries.

           During the first quarter of 2015, the Company identified a non-material error in its accounting for income from CLO equity investments   refer to  Note 3. Change of Accounting for Collateralized Loan Obligation Equity Income.  Prospectively as of January 1, 2015, the Company records income from its CLO equity investments using the effective yield method in accordance with the accounting guidance in ASC 325-40,  Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets , based upon an estimation of an effective yield to the expected redemption utilizing estimated cash flows.

incentive fees as well as adjustments for dilutive effect of Convertible Notes were excluded from the diluted earnings per share computation. The following table represents the adjustments which were not made due to the anti-dilutive effect on the computation of diluted change in net assets resulting from net investment income per common share and the diluted change in net assets resulting from operations per common share for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

NOTE 9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

 In March 2016, TICC Management, in consultation with the independent members of the Board of Directors, agreed to a series of ongoing fee waivers with respect to its management fee and income incentive fee. Under the terms of the fee waiver letter, which took effect on April 1, 2016: 

TICC Management agreed to forgo the payment of any base management fees on funds received in connection with any capital raises until the funds are invested; 

The calculation of the Company s income incentive fee was revised to include a total return requirement that will limit TICC s obligation to pay TICC Management an income incentive fee if TICC has generated cumulative net decreases in net assets resulting from operations during the calendar quarter for which such fees are being calculated and the eleven preceding quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters since April 1, 2016) due to unrealized or realized net losses on investments and even in the event TICC s net investment income exceeds the minimum return to TICC s stockholders required to be achieved before TICC Management is entitled to receive an income incentive fee (which minimum return is commonly referred to as the preferred return or the hurdle rate);

 TICC CAPITAL CORP.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  (unaudited)  

 NOTE 9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    (continued) 

The income incentive fee incorporated a  catch-up  provision which provides that TICC Management will receive 100% of TICC s net investment income with respect to that portion of such net investment income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than 2.1875% quarterly (8.75% annualized) and 20% of any net investment income thereafter; and 

The hurdle rate used to calculate the income incentive fee was changed from a variable rate based on the five-year U.S. Treasury note plus 5.00% (with a maximum of 10.00%) to a fixed rate of 7.00%.  

After these changes took effect on April 1, 2016, under no circumstances will the aggregate fees earned by TICC Management from April 1, 2016 in any quarterly period be higher than those aggregate fees would have been prior to the adoption of these changes.  

 Investment Advisory Fees  

 The Company has entered into an investment advisory agreement with TICC Management (the  Investment Advisory Agreement ) under which TICC Management, subject to the overall supervision of TICC s Board of Directors, manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, TICC. For providing these services TICC Management receives a fee from TICC, consisting of two components: a base management fee (the  Base Fee ) and an incentive fee. Through March 31, 2016, the Base Fee was calculated at an annual rate of 2.00%. Effective April 1, 2016, the Base Fee is calculated at an
annual rate of 1.50%. The Base Fee is payable quarterly in arrears, and is calculated based on the average value of TICC s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any equity or debt capital raises, repurchases or redemptions during the current calendar quarter. Accordingly, the Base Fee will be payable regardless of whether the value of the Company s gross assets have decreased during the quarter.  

 The following table represents the Base Fee for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:  

The investment advisory fee payable to TICC Management as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was $2,630,334 and $4,195,901, respectively.  

 Net Investment Income Incentive Fee  

 The incentive fee has two parts: net investment income incentive fee and capital gains incentive fee. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s  Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income  for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose,  Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income  means interest income, income from securitization vehicles and equity investments and any other income (including any other fees that TICC receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses for the quarter
(including the Base Fee, expenses payable under the Company s administration agreement with BDC Partners (the  Administration Agreement ), and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee).  Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income  includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash.  Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income  does not include any realized gains, realized losses or unrealized appreciation or depreciation.  Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income,  expressed as a rate of return on the value of the

 Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to one-fourth of an annual  hurdle rate.  Given that this portion of the incentive fee is payable without regard to any gain, loss or unrealized depreciation that may occur during the quarter, this portion of TICC Management s incentive fee may also be payable notwithstanding a decline in net asset value that quarter.  

 From January 1, 2005 through March 31, 2016, the annual hurdle rate was determined as of the immediately preceding December 31 st  by adding 5.00% to the interest rate then payable on the most recently issued five-year U.S. Treasury Notes, up to a maximum annual hurdle rate of 10.00%. The annual hurdle rates for the 2015, 2014 and 2013 calendar years were 6.65%, 6.75% and 5.72%, respectively. The hurdle rate through March 31, 2016, calculated as of December 31, 2015, was 6.76%.  

 Effective April 1, 2016, the calculation of the Company s net investment income incentive fee was revised to include a total return requirement that will limit TICC s obligation to pay TICC Management a net investment income incentive fee if TICC has generated cumulative net decreases in net assets resulting from operations during the calendar quarter for which such fees are being calculated and the eleven preceding quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters since April 1, 2016) due to unrealized or realized net losses on investments and even in the event TICC s net investment income exceeds the minimum
return to TICC s stockholders required to be achieved before TICC Management is entitled to receive an income incentive fee (which minimum return is commonly referred to as the preferred return or the hurdle rate). The hurdle rate was changed from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 7.00%. Additionally, effective April 1, 2016, the net investment income incentive fee incorporates a  catch-up  provision which provides that TICC Management will receive 100% of TICC s net investment income with respect to that portion of such net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% quarterly (8.75% annualized) and 20% of any net investment income thereafter. Under the revised net investment income incentive fee terms, under no circumstances will the aggregate fees earned from April 1, 2016 by TICC Management in any quarterly period will not be higher than those aggregate fees would have been earned prior to the adoption of these changes.  

 The following table represents the net investment income incentive fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:  

During the first quarter of 2015, the Company identified a non-material error in its accounting policy for revenue recognition   refer to  Note 3. Change of Accounting for Collateralized Loan Obligation Equity Income.  As a result of this error, because the net investment income incentive fee in prior years was based upon net investment income as previously reported, the net investment income incentive fees were overstated by approximately $2.4 million on a cumulative basis through the year ended 2014. Therefore, a reduction in expenses as well as a  due from affiliate  amount of
approximately $2.4 million was recorded for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, which represents the cumulative indirect effect of the error on the Company s net investment income incentive fees. This reversal of expenses was partially offset by net investment income incentive fees incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2015 of approximately $318,000. TICC Management repaid in full to TICC, on April 30, 2015, the portion of its previously paid net investment income incentive fees attributable to the overstated amounts.  

 The net investment income incentive fee payable to TICC Management as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was approximately $422,828 and $0, respectively.

 NOTE 9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    (continued) 

 In addition, in the event the Company recognizes PIK interest income in excess of its available capital, the Company may be required to liquidate assets in order to pay a portion of the incentive fee. TICC Management, however, is not required to reimburse the Company for the portion of any incentive fees attributable to PIK loan interest income in the event of a subsequent default.  

 Capital Gains Incentive Fees  

 The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20% of the Company s  Incentive Fee Capital Gains,  which consists of the Company s realized gains for each calendar year, computed net of all realized losses and unrealized depreciation for that calendar year. For accounting purposes only, in order to reflect the theoretical capital gains incentive fee that would be payable for a given period as if all unrealized gains were realized, the Company will
accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon net realized gains and unrealized depreciation for that calendar year (in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement), plus unrealized appreciation on investments held at the end of the period. It should be noted that a fee so calculated and accrued would not necessarily be payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of capital gains incentive fees in subsequent periods. Amounts paid under the Investment Advisory Agreement will be consistent with the formula reflected in the Investment Advisory Agreement.  

 The amount of the capital gains incentive fee expense related to the hypothetical liquidation of the portfolio (and assuming no other changes in realized or unrealized gains and losses) would only become payable to TICC Management in the event of a complete liquidation of the Company s portfolio as of period end and the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement on such date. Also, it should be noted that the capital gains incentive fee expense fluctuates with the Company s overall investment results.  

 There were no capital gains incentive fees incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. There were no accrued capital gains incentive fee payable to TICC Management as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

 Administration Agreement  

 The Company has also entered into the Administration Agreement with BDC Partners under which BDC Partners provides administrative services for TICC. The Company pays BDC Partners an allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by BDC Partners in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including a portion of the rent and the compensation of the Company s Chief Financial Officer, accounting staff and other administrative support personnel, which creates potential conflicts of interest that the Board of Directors must monitor. The Company also reimburses BDC Partners for the costs
associated with the functions performed by TICC s Chief Compliance Officer that BDC Partners pays on the Company s behalf pursuant to the terms of an agreement between the Company and Alaric Compliance Services, LLC.  

 TICC Management is controlled by BDC Partners, its managing member. Charles M. Royce holds a minority, non-controlling interest in TICC Management. BDC Partners manages the business and internal affairs of TICC Management. Jonathan H. Cohen, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, as well as a Director, is the managing member of BDC Partners. Saul B. Rosenthal, the Company s President and Chief Operating Officer, is also the President and Chief Operating Officer of TICC Management and a member of BDC Partners. Messrs. Cohen and Rosenthal have an equal equity interest in BDC Partners. Mr. Royce does not take part in
the management or participate in the operations of TICC Management; however, Mr. Royce is expected to be available from time to time to TICC Management to provide certain consulting services without compensation.

$83,213 and $82,675, respectively.  

 NOTE 10. DISTRIBUTIONS  

 The Company intends to continue to operate so as to qualify to be taxed as a RIC under the Code and, as such, the Company would not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of its taxable income and gains distributed to stockholders. To qualify to be taxed as a RIC, the Company is required, among other requirements, to distribute at least 90% of its annual investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is based upon the annual taxable income estimated by the management of the Company. Income calculated in
accordance with U.S. federal income tax regulations differs substantially from GAAP income. To the extent that the Company s taxable earnings fall below the amount of distributions declared, however, a portion of the total amount of the Company s distributions for the fiscal year may be deemed a return of capital for tax purposes to the Company s stockholders.  

 The Company intends to comply with the applicable provisions of the Code pertaining to RICs to make distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it of substantially all federal income taxes. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a 4% excise tax on such income. The Company will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income, if any, as required.  

 On September 30, 2016 the Company paid a distribution of $0.29 per share. The Company has a distribution reinvestment plan under which distributions are paid to stockholders in the form of additional shares issued or purchased in the open market, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash.  

 NOTE 11. NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE  

 The Company s net asset value per share at September 30, 2016 was $7.08, and at December 31, 2015 was $6.40. In determining the Company s net asset value per share, the Board of Directors determined in good faith the fair value of the Company s portfolio investments for which reliable market quotations are not readily available.

 On November 5, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a new program for the purpose of repurchasing up to $75 million worth of the Company s common stock. Under this repurchase program, the Company was authorized, but was not obligated, to repurchase outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time through June 30, 2016, provided that repurchases comply with the prohibitions under the Company s Insider Trading Policies and Procedures and the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including certain price, market volume and timing constraints. Further, any
repurchases must be conducted in accordance with the 1940 Act. Additionally, the Company entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan to undertake accretive share repurchasing on a non-discretionary basis of up to $50 million until March 4, 2016. In aggregate, under the repurchase program authorized on November 5, 2015, the Company repurchased 3,591,551 shares of its common stock for approximately $23.7 million at the weighted average price of approximately $6.63 per share, inclusive of commissions, through December 31, 2015. This represents a premium of approximately 3.6% of the net asset value per share at December 31, 2015.  

 The Company did not repurchase shares of its common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as the Board authorized program to repurchase up to $75 million worth of the Company s common stock expired on June 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased shares under the November 5, 2015 repurchase program totaling 4,917,026 shares of its common stock for approximately $25.6 million at the weighted average price of approximately $5.20 per share, inclusive of commissions. This represents a discount of approximately 26.6% of the net asset value per share at September 30,
2016.

 NOTE 16. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    (continued) 

 In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  ( ASU 2015-02 ). The new guidance applies to entities in all industries and provides a new scope exception to registered money market funds and similar unregistered money market funds. It makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the VIE guidance. ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted ASU 2015-02
beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not affect the Company s consolidated results of operation and financial condition.  

 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ). The new guidance requires debt issuance costs (deferred financing costs) related to a recognized debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts. Additionally, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs
Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  ( ASU 2015-15 ), which codifies an SEC staff announcement that entities are permitted to defer and present debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements as assets and subsequent amortization of the deferred costs over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-03 and 2015-15 are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and 2015-15 beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of ASUs 2015-03 and 2015-15 did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated results of operation and financial condition; however, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the adoption of ASU 2015-03 did result in the reclassification of approximately $2.7 million and approximately $3.8 million,
respectively, in deferred debt issuance costs which post-adoption are a direct deduction from the related debt liability. The December 31, 2015 balances have been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application, as required by ASU 2015-03.  

 In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,  Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)  ( ASU 2015-07 ). Under the amendments in this Update, investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient should not be categorized in the fair value hierarchy. Removing those investments from the fair value hierarchy not only eliminates the diversity in practice resulting from the way in which investments measured at net asset value per share (or its
equivalent) with future redemption dates are classified, but also ensures that all investments categorized in the fair value hierarchy are classified using a consistent approach. Investments that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent), but for which the practical expedient is not applied will continue to be included in the fair value hierarchy. ASU 2015-07 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted ASU 2014-07 beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-07 did not affect the Company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  

 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)  ( ASU 2016-15 ), which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. We are currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-15 and do not anticipate a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption
permitted.

 NOTE 17. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  

 The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions and, at times, cash held in checking accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit. In addition, the Company s portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies, which will subject the Company to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt securities that the Company holds or if those sectors experience a market downturn.  

 NOTE 18. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES  

 The U.S. capital markets have recently experienced periods of extreme volatility and disruption. Disruptions in the capital markets tend to increase the spread between the yields realized on risk-free and higher risk securities, resulting in illiquidity in parts of the capital markets. The Company believes these conditions may reoccur in the future. A prolonged period of market illiquidity may have an adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the Company s funding costs, limit the Company s access to the capital
markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to the Company. These events could limit the Company s investment originations, limit the Company s ability to grow and negatively impact the Company s operating results.  

 Many of the companies in which the Company has made or will make investments may be susceptible to adverse economic conditions, which may affect the ability of a company to repay TICC s loans or engage in a liquidity event such as a sale, recapitalization, or initial public offering. Therefore, the Company s nonperforming assets may increase, and the value of the Company s portfolio may decrease during this period. Adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of any collateral securing some of the Company s loans and the value of its equity investments. Adverse economic conditions could lead to
financial losses in the Company s portfolio and a decrease in its revenues, net income, and the value of the Company s assets.  

 A portfolio company s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by the Company or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of the portfolio company s loans and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize the portfolio company s ability to meet its obligations under the debt securities that the Company holds. The Company may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. In addition, if a portfolio company goes bankrupt,
even though the Company may have structured its investment as senior debt or secured debt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which the Company actually provided significant  managerial assistance,  if any, to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might re-characterize the Company s debt holding and subordinate all or a portion of the Company s claim to that of other creditors. These events could harm the Company s financial condition and operating results.  

 As a BDC, the Company is required to carry its investments at market value or, if no market value is ascertainable, at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of its Board of Directors. Decreases in the market values or fair values of the Company s investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation. Depending on market conditions, the Company could incur substantial losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

 NOTE 19. EXPENSES RELATED TO THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS  

 In August 2015 a Special Committee was established to evaluate any or all strategic alternatives for the Company, including but not limited to continuing with the Company s current strategic plan, making changes to the current strategic plan, liquidating the Company s assets and/or a potential transaction involving some or all of the stock, assets or business of the Company or TICC Management, or any other alternative transaction.  

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred expenses of approximately $1.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively, primarily related to the work of the Special Committee, including the engagement of legal and financial advisors to the Special Committee, net of the effects of an approximately $791,000 insurance recovery related to previously incurred legal costs.

   CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about TICC Capital Corp., our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as  anticipates,   expects,   intends,   plans,   will,   may,   continue,   believes,   seeks,   estimates,   would, 
 could,   should,   targets,   projects,  and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to: 

our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 

the impact of investments that we expect to make; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

our expected financings and investments; 

the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; and 

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies.  

These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 

an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies  ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies; 

a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair our lending and investment activities; 

interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly because we use leverage as part of our investment strategy; 

currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars; and 

the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in  Item 1A.   Risk Factors  contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC.  

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our
plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in  Item 1A.   Risk Factors  contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,

 The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

   OVERVIEW 

 Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio s total return. Our primary focus is to seek current income by investing in corporate debt securities. We have also invested and may continue to invest in structured finance investments, including CLO vehicles, which own debt securities. We may also invest in publicly traded debt and/or equity securities. We operate as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company and have elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ). We have elected to be
treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company ( RIC ), under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), beginning with our 2003 taxable year.  

 Our investment activities are managed by TICC Management, LLC ( TICC Management ) a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. TICC Management is owned by BDC Partners, LLC ( BDC Partners ), its managing member, and Charles M. Royce, a member of our Board of Directors, who holds a minority, non-controlling interest in TICC Management. Jonathan H. Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer, and Saul B. Rosenthal, our President and Chief Operating Officer, are the controlling members of BDC Partners. Under an investment advisory agreement (the  Investment Advisory
Agreement ), we have agreed to pay TICC Management an annual base fee calculated on gross assets, and an incentive fee based upon our performance. Under an amended and restated administration agreement (the  Administration Agreement ), we have agreed to pay or reimburse BDC Partners, as administrator, for certain expenses incurred in operating TICC. Our executive officers and directors, and the executive officers of TICC Management and BDC Partners, serve or may serve as officers and directors of entities that operate in a line of business similar to our own. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders.  

 We generally expect to invest between $5 million and $50 million in each of our portfolio companies, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes and market conditions warrant, and accrue interest at fixed or variable rates. We expect that our investment portfolio will be diversified among a large number of investments with few investments, if any, exceeding 5.0% of the total portfolio. As of September 30, 2016, our debt investments had stated interest rates of between 4.75% and 15.00% and maturity dates of between 24 and 104 months. In addition, our total portfolio had a
weighted average yield on debt investments of approximately 8.0%.  

 We have historically borrowed funds to make investments and may continue to borrow funds to make investments. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of leverage, which may be considered a speculative investment technique. Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain and loss on amounts invested and therefore increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. In addition, the costs associated with our borrowings, including any increase in the management fee payable to TICC Management, will be borne by our common stockholders.  

 In addition, as a BDC under the 1940 Act, we are required to make available significant managerial assistance, for which we may receive fees, to our portfolio companies. These fees would be generally non-recurring, however in some instances they may have a recurring component. We have received no fee income for managerial assistance to date.  

58 

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

 Prior to making an investment, we may enter into a non-binding term sheet with the potential portfolio company. These term sheets are generally subject to a number of conditions, including but not limited to the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigations of the company s business and legal documentation for the loan.  

 To the extent possible, we will generally seek to invest in loans that are collateralized by a security interest in the borrower s assets or guaranteed by a principal to the transaction. Interest payments, if not deferred, are normally payable quarterly with most debt investments having scheduled principal payments on a monthly or quarterly basis. When we receive a warrant to purchase stock in a portfolio company, the warrant will typically have a nominal strike price, and will entitle us to purchase a modest percentage of the borrower s stock.  

   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

 The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified investment valuation and investment income as critical accounting policies.  

 Investment Valuation 

 The Company fair values its investment portfolio in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure . Estimates made in the preparation of TICC s consolidated financial statements include the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded. TICC believes that there is no single definitive method for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied
valuation process for the types of investments TICC makes.  

 ASC 820-10 clarified the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active
markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities in markets that are not active; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. TICC considers the attributes of current market conditions on an ongoing basis and has determined that due to the general illiquidity of the market for its investment portfolio, whereby little or no market data exists, almost all of TICC s investments are based upon  Level 3  inputs as of September 30, 2016.  

 TICC s Board of Directors determines the value of its investment portfolio each quarter. In connection with that determination, members of TICC Management s portfolio management team prepare a quarterly analysis of each portfolio investment using the most recent portfolio company financial statements, forecasts and other relevant financial and operational information. Since March 2004, TICC has engaged third-party valuation firms to provide assistance in valuing certain of its syndicated loans and bilateral investments, including related equity investments, although TICC s Board of Directors ultimately
determines the appropriate valuation of each such investment. Changes in fair value, as described above, are recorded in the statement of operations as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation.  

 Syndicated Loans 

 In accordance with ASC 820-10, TICC s valuation procedures specifically provide for the review of indicative quotes supplied by the large agent banks that make a market for each security. However, the marketplace from which TICC obtains indicative bid quotes for purposes of determining the fair value of its  

59 

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

 syndicated loan investments has shown attributes of illiquidity as described by ASC-820-10. During such periods of illiquidity, when TICC believes that the non-binding indicative bids received from agent banks for certain syndicated investments that we own may not be determinative of their fair value or when no market indicative quote is available, TICC may engage third-party valuation firms to provide assistance in valuing certain syndicated investments that TICC owns. In addition, TICC Management prepares an analysis of each syndicated loan, financial summary, covenant compliance review, recent trading activity in the
security, if known, and other business developments related to the portfolio company. All available information, including non-binding indicative bids which may not be determinative of fair value, is presented to the Valuation Committee to consider in its determination of fair value. In some instances, there may be limited trading activity in a security even though the market for the security is considered not active. In such cases the Valuation Committee will consider the number of trades, the size and timing of each trade, and other circumstances around such trades, to the extent such information is available, in its determination of fair value. The Valuation Committee will evaluate the impact of such additional information, and factor it into its consideration of the fair value that is indicated by the analysis provided by third-party valuation firms, if any.  

 Collateralized Loan Obligations   Debt and Equity 

 During the past seven years, TICC has acquired a number of debt and equity positions in CLO investment vehicles and, more recently, CLO warehouse investments. These investments are special purpose financing vehicles. In valuing such investments, TICC considers the indicative prices provided by a recognized industry pricing service as a primary source, and the implied yield of such prices, supplemented by actual trades executed in the market at or around period-end, as well as the indicative prices provided by the broker who arranges transactions in such investment vehicles. TICC also considers those instances in which the
record date for an equity distribution payment falls on the last day of the period, and the likelihood that a prospective purchaser would require a downward adjustment to the indicative price representing substantially all of the pending distribution. Additional factors include any available information on other relevant transactions including firm bids and offers in the market and information resulting from bids-wanted-in-competition. In addition, TICC considers the operating metrics of the specific investment vehicle, including compliance with collateralization tests, defaulted and restructured securities, and payment defaults, if any. TICC Management or the Valuation Committee may request an additional analysis by a third-party firm to assist in the valuation process of CLO investment vehicles. All information is presented to TICC s Board of Directors for its determination of fair value of these investments.  

 Bilateral Investments (Including Equity) 

 Bilateral investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued by an independent pricing agent or market maker. If such market quotations are not readily available, under the valuation procedures approved by TICC s Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Valuation Committee, a third-party valuation firm will prepare valuations for each of TICC s bilateral investments that, when combined with all other investments in the same portfolio company, (i) have a value as of the previous quarter of greater than or equal to 2.5% of its total assets as of the previous quarter, and (ii) have a
value as of the current quarter of greater than or equal to 2.5% of its total assets as of the previous quarter, after taking into account any repayment of principal during the current quarter. In addition, in those instances where a third-party valuation is prepared for a portfolio investment which meets the parameters noted in (i) and (ii) above, the frequency of those third-party valuations is based upon the grade assigned to each such security under its credit grading system as follows: Grade 1, at least annually; Grade 2, at least semi-annually; Grades 3, 4, and 5, at least quarterly. Bilateral investments which do not meet the parameters in (i) and (ii) above are not required to have a third-party valuation and, in those instances, a valuation analysis will be prepared by TICC Management. TICC Management also retains the authority to seek, on TICC s behalf, additional third party valuations with respect to both TICC s bilateral portfolio securities and TICC s
syndicated loan investments. TICC s Board of Directors retains ultimate authority as to the third-party review cycle as well as the appropriate valuation of each investment.

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

 Significant Unobservable Inputs for Level 3 Investments 

 The following tables provide quantitative information about the Company s Level 3 fair value measurements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company s valuation policy, as described above, establishes parameters for the sources and types of valuation analysis, as well as the methodologies and inputs that the Company uses in determining fair value. If the Valuation Committee or TICC Management determines that additional techniques, sources or inputs are appropriate or necessary in a given situation, such additional work will be undertaken. The tables, therefore, are not all-inclusive,
but provide information on the significant Level 3 inputs that are pertinent to the Company s fair value measurements. The weighted average calculations in the table below are based on principal balances for all debt related calculations and CLO equity.  

(1) 

           The Company generally uses prices provided by an independent pricing service, or broker or agent bank non-binding indicative bid prices ( NBIB ) on or near the valuation date as the primary basis for the fair value determinations for syndicated notes, and CLO debt and equity investments, which may be adjusted for pending equity distributions as of valuation date. These bid prices are non-binding, and may not be determinative of fair value. Each bid price is evaluated by the Valuation Committee in conjunction with additional information compiled by TICC Management, including financial performance, recent business developments, and, in the case of CLO debt and equity investments, performance and covenant compliance information as provided by the independent trustee.  

(2) 

           EBITDA, or earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is an unobservable input which is generally based on the most recently available twelve month financial statements provided by the portfolio company. Market multiples, also an unobservable input, represent an estimation of where market participants might value an enterprise based upon information available for comparable companies in the market.  

(3)

           The Company generally uses prices provided by an independent pricing service, or broker or agent bank non-binding indicative bid prices ( NBIB ) on or near the valuation date as the primary basis for the fair value determinations for syndicated notes, and CLO debt and equity investments, which may be adjusted for pending equity distributions as of valuation date. These bid prices are non-binding, and may not be determinative of fair value. Each bid price is evaluated by the Valuation Committee in conjunction with additional information compiled by TICC Management, including financial performance, recent business developments, and, in the case of CLO debt and equity investments, performance and covenant compliance information as provided by the independent trustee.

The following table shows the fair value of TICC s portfolio of investments by asset class as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Investment Income  

 Interest Income 

 Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis using the contractual rate applicable to each debt investment and includes the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums. Discounts from and premiums to par value on securities purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, if any.  

69 

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

 Generally, when interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if the Company otherwise does not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, the Company will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. The Company generally restores non-accrual loans to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in the
Company s judgment, is likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no investments on non-accrual status and as of December 31, 2015, the Company s investment in RBS Holding Company second lien senior secured notes was on non-accrual status.  

 In addition, the Company earns income from the discount on debt securities it purchases, including original issue discount ( OID ) and market discount. OID and market discounts are capitalized and amortized into income using the interest method, as applicable.  

 Income from Securitization Vehicles and Equity Investments 

 Income from investments in the equity class securities of CLO vehicles (typically income notes or subordinated notes) is recorded using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC 325-40, based upon an effective yield to the expected redemption utilizing estimated cash flows, including those CLO equity investments that have not made their inaugural distribution for the relevant period end. The Company monitors the expected residual payments, and effective yield is determined and updated periodically, as needed. Accordingly, investment income recognized on CLO equity securities in the GAAP statement
of operations differs from both the tax-basis investment income and from the cash distributions actually received by the Company during the period.  

 Payment-In-Kind 

 TICC has investments in its portfolio which contain a contractual payment-in-kind ( PIK ) provision. Certain PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or additional securities. PIK interest computed at the contractual rate is accrued into income and added to the principal balance on the capitalization date. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored to accrual status once it becomes probable that PIK will be realized. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC,
this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions, even though TICC has not collected any cash. Amounts necessary to pay these distributions may come from available cash or the liquidation of certain investments.  

 Other Income 

 Other income includes distributions from fee letters and success fees associated with portfolio investments. Distributions from fee letters are an enhancement to the return on a CLO equity investment and are based upon a percentage of the collateral manager s fees, and are recorded as other income when earned. The Company may also earn success fees associated with its investments in certain securitization vehicles or  CLO warehouse facilities,  which are contingent upon a repayment of the warehouse by a permanent CLO securitization structure; such fees are earned and recognized when the repayment is completed.

   PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY 

 The total fair value of our investment portfolio was approximately $590.9 million and $656.7 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The decrease in the value of investments during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to debt repayments and sales of securities totaling approximately $238.4 million and realized losses of $13.2 million, partially offset by purchases of investments of approximately $144.6 million and net unrealized appreciation on our investment portfolio of approximately $70.5 million (which incorporates reductions to CLO equity cost value of $30.3
million). Refer to the table below which reconciles the investment portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015.  

 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we closed approximately $58.4 million in portfolio investments, including additional investments of approximately $34.6 million in existing portfolio companies and approximately $23.8 million in new portfolio companies. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we closed approximately $234.8 million in portfolio investments, including additional investments of approximately $130.4 million in existing portfolio companies and approximately $104.4 million in new portfolio companies.  

 In certain instances, we receive payments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances and sales of portfolio investments. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly from period to period. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we recognized proceeds of approximately $74.7 million from sales, whereas, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized proceeds of approximately $196.2 million from the sales of securities. Also, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we
had repayments and amortization payments of approximately $50.5 million whereas, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we had repayments and amortization payments of approximately $224.2 million.  

 As of September 30, 2016, we had investments in debt securities of, or loans to, 36 portfolio companies, with a fair value of approximately $386.4 million, and equity investments of approximately $204.5 million. These debt investments included approximately $0.1 million in PIK interest, which, as described in    Overview  above, is added to the carrying value of our investments, reduced by repayments of principal.  

 As of December 31, 2015, we had investments in debt securities of, or loans to, 45 portfolio companies, with a fair value of approximately $468.9 million, and equity investments of approximately $187.8 million. These debt investments included approximately $0.6 million in accrued PIK interest.

           For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, reduction to cost value on our CLO equity investments represents the difference between distributions received, or entitled to be received for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, of approximately $52.8 million and the effective yield interest income of approximately $22.5 million.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

  Set forth below is a comparison of our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the three months ended September 30, 2015.   

 Investment Income 

 Investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was approximately $18.1 million and $23.1 million, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $5.0 million. The following tables set forth the components of investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015:  

The decrease in total investment income was primarily due to a reduction of stated interest income of $3.6 million resulting largely from a smaller portfolio due to loan sale activity to fund the voluntary partial redemption of the TICC CLO 2012-1 LLC class A-1 notes, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in total commitment, amendment and other fee income primarily due to an increase in loan prepayment fees. The total principal value of income producing debt investments as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was approximately $416.6 million and $700.9 million, respectively.  

 As of September 30, 2016, our debt investments had stated interest rates of between 4.75% and 15.00% and maturity dates of between 24 and 104 months compared to stated interest rates of 4.00% to 15.00% and maturity dates between 6 and 100 months as of September 30, 2015. In addition, our total portfolio had a weighted average yield on debt investments of approximately 8.0% as of September 30, 2016, compared to approximately 7.2% as of September 30, 2015. The increase in the weighted average yield on our debt portfolio over the past two quarters is primarily due to our ongoing strategy of rotating the corporate loan portfolio
into higher-yielding, less liquid loans and the restructuring of our investment held in RBS Holding Company.  

 Operating Expenses 

 Expenses before incentive fees for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $11.8 million, which increased by approximately $0.1 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2015, attributable to higher professional and general and administrative expenses partially offset by lower base management fees. Expenses before incentive fees for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were approximately $11.7 million.  

 The investment advisory base management fees for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $2.6 million compared with $5.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. That decrease was due largely to the previously announced fee reduction from 2.00% to 1.50% of gross assets (refer to  Incentive Fees,  below, for discussion of ongoing fee waivers), as well as a decline in the weighted  

75 

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

 average gross assets due to the sale of certain assets to pay-off the TICC Funding credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2015 and to fund the voluntary partial redemption of the TICC CLO 2012-1 LLC class A-1 notes of $36.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately $3.1 million and $4.2 million, respectively, of base management fees remained payable to TICC Management.  

 Interest expense and other debt financing expenses for the third quarter of 2016 were approximately $5.1 million, which was directly related to our TICC CLO 2012-1 debt and 7.50% Convertible Notes due 2017 ( Convertible Notes ), compared to interest expense and other debt financing expenses of approximately $5.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the acceleration of deferred debt issuance costs ($0.3 million) and the acceleration of debt discount ($0.4 million) resulting from the $36.0 million partial redemption of the TICC CLO 2012-1 LLC class A-1 notes. The aggregate
accrued interest which remained payable at September 30, 2016, was approximately $4.3 million, comprised of $0.7 million for the notes of TICC CLO 2012-1 and $3.6 million for the Convertible Notes. The aggregate interest payable at December 31, 2015, was approximately $2.1 million.  

 Professional fees, consisting of legal, financial advisory, valuation, audit and tax fees, were approximately $2.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $0.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. This represented an increase of approximately $1.4 million primarily due to the engagement of legal and financial advisors to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors.  

 Compensation expenses were approximately $0.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $0.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, reflecting the allocation of compensation expenses for the services of our Chief Financial Officer, accounting personnel, and other administrative support staff. This increase was largely the result of staffing changes which occurred during each respective quarter.  

 General and administrative expenses, consisting primarily of directors  fees, insurance, listing fees, transfer agent and custodian fees, office supplies, facilities costs and other expenses, were approximately $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was the direct result of proxy related costs of approximately $1.1 million recognized during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (such costs include fees for mailing, filing, processing, tabulation, and solicitation). Office supplies, facilities costs and
other expenses are allocated to us under the terms of the Administration Agreement.  

 Incentive Fees 

 The net investment income incentive fee recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.4 million, compared to $0.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease results from modifications made to the incentive fee calculation as described below.  

 In March 2016, TICC Management, in consultation with the independent members of the Board of Directors, agreed to a series of ongoing fee waivers with respect to its management fee and income incentive fee. Under the terms of the fee waiver letter, which took effect on April 1, 2016: 

TICC Management agreed to forgo the payment of any base management fees on funds received in connection with any capital raises until the funds are invested; 

The calculation of the Company s income incentive fee was revised to include a total return requirement that will limit TICC s obligation to pay TICC Management an income incentive fee if TICC has generated cumulative net decreases in net assets resulting from operations during the calendar quarter for which such fees are being calculated and the eleven preceding quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters since April 1, 2016) due to unrealized or realized net losses on investments and even in the event TICC s net investment income exceeds the minimum return to TICC s stockholders required to be achieved before TICC Management is entitled to receive an income incentive fee (which minimum return is commonly referred to as the preferred return or the hurdle rate); 

76

The income incentive fee incorporated a  catch-up  provision which provides that TICC Management will receive 100% of TICC s net investment income with respect to that portion of such net investment income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than 2.1875% quarterly (8.75% annualized) and 20% of any net investment income thereafter; and 

The hurdle rate used to calculate the income incentive fee was changed from a variable rate based on the five-year U.S. Treasury note plus 5.00% (with a maximum of 10.00%) to a fixed rate of 7.00%.  

After these changes took effect on April 1, 2016, under no circumstances will the aggregate fees earned by TICC Management from April 1, 2016 in any quarterly period be higher than those aggregate fees would have been prior to the adoption of these changes.  

 The capital gains incentive fee expense, as reported under GAAP, is calculated on the basis of net realized and unrealized gains and losses at the end of each period. The expense related to the hypothetical liquidation of the portfolio (and assuming no other changes in realized or unrealized gains and losses) would only become payable to our investment adviser in the event of a complete liquidation of our portfolio as of period end and the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement on such date. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, no accrual was required as a result of the impact of
accumulated net unrealized depreciation on our portfolio.  

 The amount of the capital gains incentive fee which will actually be payable is determined in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and is calculated as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement). The terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement state that the capital gains incentive fee calculation is based on net realized gains, if any, offset by gross unrealized depreciation for the calendar year. No effect is given to gross unrealized appreciation in this calculation. For the year ended December 31, 2015, such an accrual was not required under the
terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement.  

 Realized and Unrealized Gains/Losses on Investments 

 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized net realized losses on investments of approximately $5.3 million, which primarily reflects the losses from the sale of several CLO equity investments and the restructuring of our investment in RBS Holding Company second lien senior secured notes.  

 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation was approximately $42.3 million primarily due to improvements in the corporate loan market, composed of $36.4 million in gross unrealized appreciation, $3.1 million in gross unrealized depreciation and approximately $9.0 million relating to the reversal of prior period net unrealized depreciation as investment gains and losses were realized. This includes net unrealized appreciation of approximately $9.4 million as a result of reductions to the cost value of our CLO equity investments under the effective yield accounting
methodology, whereby the cost value of the respective investments are reduced by the excess of actual cash received (and record date distributions to be received) over the calculated income using the effective yield.

 The most significant components of the net change in unrealized appreciation and depreciation during the three months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows:  

For the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we recorded net realized gains on investments of approximately $0.4 million, which primarily reflects the gains from the repayment of our debt investment held in Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, Inc.  

 Based upon the fair value determinations made in good faith by the Board of Directors, during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we had net unrealized depreciation of approximately $41.0 million, composed of $1.1 million in gross unrealized appreciation, $41.7 million in gross unrealized depreciation and approximately $0.4 million relating to the reversal of prior period net unrealized appreciation as investment gains and losses were realized. This includes net unrealized appreciation of approximately $9.7 million as a result of reductions to the cost value of our CLO equity investments under the effective yield accounting
methodology, whereby the cost value of the respective investments are reduced by the excess of actual cash received (and record date distributions to be received) over the calculated income using the effective yield.

Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Net Investment Income 

 Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was approximately $5.9 million and $10.9 million, respectively, or a decrease of $5.0 million. The net decrease was the result of lower investment income of $5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the net increase in net assets resulting from net investment income per common share was $0.11 (basic and diluted), compared to the net increase in net assets resulting from net investment income per share of $0.18 (basic and diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Due to the anti-dilutive effect on the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the adjustments for interest on Convertible Notes, investment advisory fees, deferred issuance costs and net investment income incentive fees as well as adjustments for
dilutive effect of Convertible Notes were excluded from the respective period s diluted earnings per share computation.  

 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the net increase in the net assets resulting from core net investment income per common share was $0.30 (basic and diluted), compared to $0.34 (basic and diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

 Please see    Supplemental Information Regarding Core Net Investment Income  below for more information.  

 Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 

 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $42.9 million compared with a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $29.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was largely due to greater unrealized appreciation on investments of $83.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income of $5.0 million and greater net realized losses of approximately $5.7 million.  

 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations per common share was $0.83 (basic) and $0.72 (diluted), compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations per share of approximately $0.50 (basic and diluted) for the three months ended

 Set forth below is a comparison of our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

 Investment Income 

 Investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was approximately $50.4 million and $68.6 million, respectively, reflecting a decrease of approximately $18.2 million. The following tables set forth the components of investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015:  

The decrease in total investment income ($18.2 million) was due primarily to lower interest income on debt investments ($14.1 million) due to lower yields from loan sale activity to fund both the repayment of the TICC Funding credit facility during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 and the voluntary partial redemption of the TICC CLO 2012-1 class A-1 notes during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, income from securitization vehicles declined ($3.9 million) largely as a result of volatility in the corporate loan market and a lower cost basis in the CLO equity portfolio. The total principal value of income
producing debt investments as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was approximately $416.6 million and $700.9 million, respectively.  

 As of September 30, 2016, our debt investments had stated interest rates of between 4.75% and 15.00% and maturity dates of between 24 and 104 months compared to stated interest rates of 4.00% to 15.00% and maturity dates between 6 and 100 months as of September 30, 2015. In addition, our total portfolio had a weighted average yield on debt investments of approximately 8.0% as of September 30, 2016, compared to approximately 7.2% as of September 30, 2015. The increase in the weighted average yield on our debt portfolio over the past several quarters is primarily due to our ongoing strategy of rotating the corporate loan
portfolio into higher-yielding, less liquid loans and the restructuring of our investment previously held in RBS Holding Company.

 Operating Expenses 

 Expenses before incentive fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $32.0 million, which decreased approximately $3.5 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2015, attributable to lower investment advisory base management fees, interest expense and compensation expense partially offset by higher professional fees and general and administrative expenses. Expenses before incentive fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were approximately $35.5 million.  

 The investment advisory base management fee for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $8.7 million compared with $15.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. That decrease was largely due to the previously announced fee reduction from 2.00% to 1.50% of gross assets (refer to  Incentive Fees,  below, for discussion of ongoing fee waivers), as well as a decline in the weighted average gross due to the sale of certain assets to pay-off the TICC Funding credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2015 and to fund the voluntary partial redemption of the TICC CLO 2012-1 LLC class A-1
notes of $36.0 million during the third quarter of 2016. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately $3.1 million and $4.2 million, respectively, of base management fees remained payable to TICC Management.  

 Interest expense and other debt financing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $13.8 million, which was directly related to our TICC CLO 2012-1 debt and Convertible Notes compared to interest expense and other debt financing expenses of approximately $15.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The primary driver of the decrease was the pay-off of the TICC Funding credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by acceleration of deferred debt issuance costs ($0.3 million) and the acceleration of debt discount ($0.4 million) due to the partial redemption of the
TICC CLO 2012-1 LLC Class A-1 Notes during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

 The aggregate accrued interest which remained payable at September 30, 2016 was approximately $4.3 million, comprised of $0.7 million for the notes of TICC CLO 2012-1 and $3.6 million for the Convertible Notes. The aggregate interest payable at December 31, 2015 was approximately $2.1 million.  

 Professional fees, consisting of legal, financial advisory, valuation, audit and tax fees, were approximately $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This represented an increase of approximately $3.1 million primarily due to the engagement of legal and financial advisors to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors, partially offset by an insurance recovery of approximately $0.8 million related to previously incurred legal costs.  

 Compensation expenses were approximately $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting the allocation of compensation expenses for the services of our Chief Financial Officer, accounting personnel, and other administrative support staff. This decrease was largely the result of staffing changes during the past 12 months.  

 General and administrative expenses, consisting primarily of directors  fees, insurance, listing fees, transfer agent and custodian fees, office supplies, facilities costs and other expenses, were approximately $3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of proxy related costs incurred of approximately $1.1 million (such costs include fees for mailing, filing, processing, tabulation, and solicitation). Office supplies, facilities costs and other expenses are allocated to us under the
terms of the Administration Agreement.  

 Incentive Fees 

 The net investment income incentive fee recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.7 million, compared to $(0.9) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was composed of the fee reversal of approximately $2.4 million, representing the cumulative overstatement of fees from 2009 through 2014 resulting from the identification and correction of a non-material error in our accounting policy for revenue recognition   refer to  Note 3.

 In March 2016, TICC Management, LLC, in consultation with the Independent Directors, agreed to a series of ongoing fee waivers with respect to its management fee and income incentive fee. Under the terms of the fee waiver letter, which took effect on April 1, 2016: 

TICC Management agreed to forgo the payment of any base management fees on funds received in connection with any capital raises until the funds are invested; 

The calculation of the Company s income incentive fee was revised to include a total return requirement that will limit TICC s obligation to pay TICC Management an income incentive fee if TICC has generated cumulative net decreases in net assets resulting from operations during the calendar quarter for which such fees are being calculated and the eleven preceding quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters since April 1, 2016) due to unrealized or realized net losses on investments and even in the event TICC s net investment income exceeds the minimum return to TICC s stockholders required to be achieved before TICC Management is entitled to receive an income incentive fee (which minimum return is commonly referred to as the preferred return or the hurdle rate); 

The income incentive fee incorporated a  catch-up  provision which provides that TICC Management will receive 100% of TICC s net investment income with respect to that portion of such net investment income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than 2.1875% quarterly (8.75% annualized) and 20% of any net investment income thereafter; and 

The hurdle rate used to calculate the income incentive fee was changed from a variable rate based on the five-year U.S. Treasury note plus 5.00% (with a maximum of 10.00%) to a fixed rate of 7.00%.  

After these changes took effect on April 1, 2016, under no circumstances will the aggregate fees earned by TICC Management from April 1, 2016 in any quarterly period be higher than those aggregate fees would have been prior to the adoption of these changes.  

 The capital gains incentive fee expense, as reported under GAAP, is calculated on the basis of net realized and unrealized gains and losses at the end of each period. The expense related to the hypothetical liquidation of the portfolio (and assuming no other changes in realized or unrealized gains and losses) would only become payable to our investment adviser in the event of a complete liquidation of our portfolio as of period end and the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement on such date. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, no accrual was required as a result of the impact of
accumulated net unrealized depreciation on our portfolio.  

 The amount of the capital gains incentive fee which will actually be payable is determined in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and is calculated as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement). The terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement state that the capital gains incentive fee calculation is based on net realized gains, if any, offset by gross unrealized depreciation for the calendar year. No effect is given to gross unrealized appreciation in this calculation. For the year ended December 31, 2015, such an accrual was not required under the
terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement.  

 Realized and Unrealized Gains/Losses on Investments 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized net realized losses on investments of approximately $13.2 million, which primarily reflects the losses from the sale of several CLO equity investments, the sale of our equity investment in Ai Squared, and the restructuring of our investment held in RBS Holding Company second lien senior secured notes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation was approximately $70.5 million, composed of $56.7 million in gross unrealized appreciation, $13.8 million in gross unrealized depreciation and approximately $27.6 million relating to the reversal of prior period net unrealized depreciation as investment gains and losses were realized. This includes net unrealized appreciation of approximately $30.3 million as a result of reductions to the cost value of our CLO equity investments under the effective yield accounting methodology, whereby the cost value of the respective
investments are reduced by the excess of actual cash received (and record date distributions to be received) over the calculated income using the effective yield.  

 The most significant components of the net change in unrealized appreciation and depreciation during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows:  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized net realized losses on investments of approximately $2.2 million, which represents the losses from the restructuring of our debt investment in Unitek Global Services, Inc. (approximately $4.3 million) and from the repayment of our debt and sale equity investments in Nextag, Inc. (approximately $2.5 million), partially offset by realized gains from the sale of our equity investment held in Merrill Communications LLC (approximately $2.8 million) and from the repayment of our debt investment held in Merrill Communications LLC (approximately $2.6 million).

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our net change in unrealized depreciation was approximately $30.8 million, composed of $7.8 million in gross unrealized appreciation, $45.5 million in gross unrealized depreciation and approximately $6.9 million relating to the reversal of prior period net unrealized depreciation as investments were realized. This includes net unrealized appreciation of approximately $29.9 million as a result of reductions to the cost value of our CLO equity investments under the effective yield accounting methodology, whereby the cost value of the respective investments are reduced by the excess
of actual cash received (and record date distributions to be received) over the calculated income using the effective yield.

Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Net Investment Income 

 Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was approximately $16.7 million and $34.1 million, respectively, or a decrease of approximately $17.4 million. The decrease was largely the result of lower investment income of $18.2 million offset by a reduction in total expenses of $0.9 million, as discussed above.  

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net increase in net assets resulting from net investment income per common share was $0.32 (basic and diluted), compared to the net increase in net assets resulting from net investment income per share of $0.57 (basic and diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Due to the anti-dilutive effect on the computation of diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the adjustments for interest on Convertible Notes, investment advisory fees, deferred issuance costs and net investment income incentive fees as well as
adjustments for dilutive effect of Convertible Notes were excluded from the respective period s diluted earnings per share computation.  

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net increase in the net assets resulting from core net investment income per common share was $0.91 (basic and diluted), compared to $1.03 (basic) and $0.96 (diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

 Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 

 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was approximately $74.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively.  

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations per common share was $1.42 (basic) and $1.28 (diluted), compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations per share of approximately $0.02 (basic and diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Due to the anti-dilutive effect on the computation of diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the adjustments for interest on Convertible Notes, investment advisory fees, deferred issuance costs and net investment income incentive fees as well as adjustments for dilutive
effect of Convertible Notes were excluded from the respective period s diluted earnings per share computation.  

 Supplemental Information Regarding Core Net Investment Income 

 On a supplemental basis, we provide information relating to 1) core net investment income and 2) the ratio of core net investment income to net assets, which are non-GAAP measures. These measures are provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net investment income. Our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Core net investment income represents net investment income adjusted for additional cash distributions received, or entitled to be received (if any, in either case), on our CLO equity investments and also excludes any
capital gains incentive fees we recognize but have no obligation to pay in any period. The Company did not recognize any capital gains incentive fees for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

 Income from investments in the  equity  class securities of CLO vehicles, for GAAP purposes, is recorded using the effective interest method based upon an effective yield to the expected redemption utilizing estimated cash flows, compared to the cost resulting in an effective yield for the investment; the difference between the actual cash received or distributions entitled to be received and the effective yield calculation is an adjustment to cost. Accordingly, investment income recognized on CLO equity securities in the GAAP statement of operations differs from the cash distributions actually received by us during
the period (referred to below as  CLO equity additional distributions ).  

 Further, in order to continue to qualify to be taxed as a regulated investment company ( RIC ), we are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income annually. Therefore, core net investment income may provide a better indication of estimated taxable income for a reporting period than does GAAP net investment income. Although we can offer no assurance that will be the case as the ultimate tax character of our earnings cannot be determined until tax returns are prepared after the end of a fiscal year. We note that these non-GAAP measures may not be useful indicators
of taxable earnings, particularly during periods of market disruption and volatility.  

 The following tables provide a reconciliation of net investment income to core net investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:

   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

 As of September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $34.7 million as compared to $23.2 million at December 31, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities for the period, consisting primarily of the items described in    Results of Operations,  was approximately $123.5 million, largely reflecting proceeds from principal repayments and reductions to cost value and sales of investments of approximately $200.4 million and reductions to CLO equity cost value of $30.3 million partially offset by purchases of new investments of approximately $126.3 million and net
change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation of $70.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in investing activities of approximately $6.0 million reflects the change in restricted cash in the 2012 Securitization Issuance. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used by financing activities was approximately $105.9 million, reflecting the distribution of dividends, partial repayment of TICC CLO 2012-1 LLC Class A-1 notes payable, and repurchase of common stock.  

 From time to time, we may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange debt securities in open market purchases or by other means dependent on market conditions, liquidity, contractual obligations, and other matters.  

 Contractual Obligations 

 A summary of our significant contractual payment obligations as of September 30, 2016 is as follows:

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

 We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices.  

 Share Repurchase Program 

 On November 5, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a program for the purpose of repurchasing up to $75 million worth of the Company s common stock. Under this repurchase program, we were authorized, but we were not obligated, to repurchase outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time through June 30, 2016, provided that repurchases comply with the prohibitions under the Company s Insider Trading Policies and Procedures and the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including certain price, market volume and timing constraints. Further, any
repurchases must be conducted in accordance with the 1940 Act. The repurchase program expired on June 30, 2016.  

 Borrowings 

 In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, the Company is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200% immediately after such borrowing. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 213%.

 Debt Securitization  

 Notes Payable   TICC CLO 2012-1 LLC 

 On August 23, 2012, we completed a $160 million debt securitization financing transaction, consisting of $120 million in secured notes and $40 million of the 2012 Subordinated Notes. On February 25, 2013 and May 28, 2013, TICC CLO 2012-1 issued additional secured notes totaling an aggregate of $120 million and 2012 Subordinated Notes totaling an aggregate of $40 million, which 2012 Subordinated Notes were purchased by us under the  accordion  feature of the debt securitization which allowed, under certain circumstances and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, for an increase in the amount of secured and
subordinated notes. It is not necessary that we own all or any of the notes permitted by this feature, which may affect the accounting treatment of the debt securitization financing transaction. On August 25, 2016, in connection with a redemption, the Securitization Issuer repaid $36.0 million of the class A-1 notes. As of September 30, 2016, the secured notes of the 2012 Securitization Issuer have an aggregate face amount of $204 million and were issued in four classes. The class A-1 notes have a current face amount of $140 million, are rated AAA  (sf) /Aaa  (sf)  by Standard   Poor s Ratings Services (S P) and Moody s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s), respectively, and bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 1.75%. The class B-1 notes have a current face amount of $20 million, are rated AAA  (sf) /Aa1  (sf)  by S P and Moody s, respectively, and bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 3.50%.

amount of $23 million, are rated AA+  (sf) /A1  (sf)  by S P and Moody s, respectively, and bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 4.75%. The class D-1 notes have a current face amount of $21 million, are rated A+  (sf) /Baa1  (sf)  by S P and Moody s, respectively, and bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 5.75%. We presently own all of the 2012 Subordinated Notes, which totaled $80 million as of September 30, 2016.  

 In connection with the redemption of $36.0 million, we incurred debt extinguishment costs of approximately $648,000, which consisted of approximately $287,000 in accelerated note discount expense and approximately $361,000 in accelerated deferred debt issuance costs.  

 During a period of up to four years from the closing date, all principal collections received on the underlying collateral may be used by the 2012 Securitization Issuer to purchase new collateral under our direction in our capacity as collateral manager of the 2012 Securitization Issuer and in accordance with our investment strategy, allowing us to maintain the initial leverage in the securitization for such four-year period. All note classes are scheduled to mature on August 25, 2023.  

 The proceeds of the private placement of the Classes A, B, C, D and 2012 Subordinated Notes of the 2012 Securitization Issuer, net of discount and debt issuance costs, were used for investment purposes. As part of the securitization, we entered into a master loan sale agreement with TICC CLO 2012-1 pursuant to which we agreed to sell or contribute certain senior secured and second lien loans (or participation interests therein) to TICC CLO 2012-1, and to purchase or otherwise acquire the 2012 Subordinated Notes. The Classes A, B, C, D and 2012 Subordinated Notes of the 2012 Securitization Issuer are the secured obligations of
TICC CLO 2012-1, and an indenture governing the notes of the 2012 Securitization Issuer includes customary covenants and events of default.  

 As of September 30, 2016, there were 31 investments in portfolio companies with a total fair value of approximately $223.7 million, collateralizing the secured notes of the 2012 Securitization Issuer. The pool of loans in the securitization must meet certain requirements, including asset mix and concentration, collateral coverage, term, agency rating, minimum coupon, minimum spread and sector diversity requirements.  

 The aggregate accrued interest payable on the notes of the 2012 Securitization Issuer at September 30, 2016 was approximately $0.7 million. Deferred debt issuance costs consist of fees and expenses incurred in connection with debt offerings. As of September 30, 2016, TICC had a deferred debt issuance balance of approximately $2.0 million associated with this securitization. Aggregate net discount on the notes of the 2012

 Convertible Notes 

 On September 26, 2012, we issued $105.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Convertible Notes due 2017 and an additional $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes was issued on October 22, 2012 pursuant to the exercise of the initial purchasers  option to purchase additional Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2013. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 87.2448 shares of its
common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $11.46 per share of common stock. The conversion price for the Convertible Notes will be reduced for quarterly cash distributions paid to common shares to the extent that the quarterly distribution exceeds $0.29 cents per share, subject to adjustment. The Convertible Notes mature on November 1, 2017, unless previously converted in accordance with their terms. We do not have the right to redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. The aggregate accrued interest payable on the Convertible Notes at September 30, 2016 was approximately $3.6 million. Deferred debt issuance costs represent fees and other direct incremental costs incurred in connection with the Convertible Notes. As of September 30, 2016, we had a deferred debt issuance balance of approximately $0.7 million. This amount is being amortized and is included in interest expense in the consolidated
statements of operations over the term of the Convertible Notes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

 The following table sets forth the components of interest expense, effective annualized average interest rates and cash paid for interest of the Convertible Notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:  

In certain circumstances, the Convertible Notes will be convertible into shares of our common stock at its initial conversion rate (listed below) subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments and the requirements of its indenture, at any time on or prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. We will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares.  

As of September 30, 2016, the principal amount of the Convertible Notes exceeded the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of our common stock.  

 The Convertible Notes are our general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of our subordinated indebtedness. As a result, the Convertible Notes will be effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to any existing and future liabilities and other indebtedness of our subsidiaries.  

 Distributions 

 In order to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and to avoid corporate level tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders, we are required, under Subchapter M of the Code, to distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and short-term capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis.  

 Effective January 1, 2015, we recorded interest from our investments in the equity class securities of CLO vehicles using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC 325-40,  Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets , based upon an estimation of an effective yield to the expected redemption utilizing estimated cash flows, including those CLO equity investments that have not made their inaugural distribution for the relevant period end. We monitor the expected residual payments, and effective yield is determined and updated periodically, as needed. Accordingly, investment income
recognized on CLO equity securities in the GAAP statement of operations differs from both the tax-basis investment income and from the cash distributions we actually received during the period. CLO entities generally constitute  passive foreign investment companies  and are subject to complex tax rules; the calculation of taxable income attributed to a CLO equity investment can be dramatically different from the calculation of income for financial reporting purposes. Taxable income is based upon the distributable share of earnings as determined under tax regulations for each CLO equity investment, while accounting income is recorded using the effective yield method. This method requires the calculation of an effective yield to expected redemption based upon an estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows, including recurring cash flows as well as future principal repayments; the difference between the actual cash received (and record date distributions to be
received) and the effective yield income calculation is an adjustment to cost. The effective  

93 

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

 yield is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as appropriate. Our final taxable earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 will not be known until our tax returns are filed, but our experience has been that cash flows have historically represented a reasonable estimate of taxable earnings. While GAAP accounting income from our CLO equity class investments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $8.6 million, we received or were entitled to receive approximately $18.0 million in distributions. Our distribution policy is based upon our estimate of our taxable net investment income, which includes actual
distributions from our CLO equity class investments, with further consideration given to our realized gains or losses on a taxable basis.  

 The following table reflects the cash distributions, including dividends and returns of capital, if any, per share that our Board of Directors has declared on our common stock since the beginning of 2014:

           Includes a taxable return of capital of approximately $0.16 per share for tax purposes.  

Related Parties 

 We have a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:  

 We have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with TICC Management. TICC Management is controlled by BDC Partners, its managing member. BDC Partners, as the managing member of TICC Management, manages the business and internal affairs of TICC Management. In addition, BDC Partners provides us with office facilities and administrative services pursuant to the Administration Agreement. Mr. Cohen is the managing member of and controls BDC Partners. Mr. Rosenthal is also the President of TICC Management and a member of BDC Partners.  

 Mr. Royce has a minority, non-controlling interest in TICC Management, but he does not take part in the management or participate in the operations of TICC Management; however, Mr. Royce has agreed to make himself available to TICC Management to provide certain consulting services without compensation.  

 Messrs. Cohen and Rosenthal currently serve as Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively, of Oxford Lane Capital Corp., a non-diversified closed-end management investment company that currently invests primarily in debt and equity tranches of CLO vehicles, and its investment adviser, Oxford Lane Management, LLC. Messrs. Cohen and Rosenthal also currently serve as Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively, at Oxford Bridge Management, LLC, the investment adviser to Oxford Bridge, LLC, a

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

 private fund that invests principally in the equity of CLOs. BDC Partners is the managing member of Oxford Bridge Management, LLC. As a result, Messrs. Cohen and Rosenthal may be subject to certain conflicts of interests with respect to their management of our portfolio on the one hand, and their respective obligations to manage Oxford Lane Capital Corp. and Oxford Bridge, LLC on the other hand.  

 TICC Management, Oxford Lane Management, LLC and Oxford Bridge Management, LLC are subject to a written policy with respect to the allocation of investment opportunities among TICC, Oxford Lane Capital Corp. and Oxford Bridge, LLC in view of the potential conflicts of interest raised by the relationships described above. The allocation policy generally provides that, depending on size and subject to current and anticipated cash availability, among other factors, investments that are suitable for more than one entity will be allocated on a pro rata basis, based on each entity s order size.  

 In the ordinary course of business, we may enter into transactions with portfolio companies that may be considered related party transactions. In order to ensure that we do not engage in any prohibited transactions with any persons affiliated with us, we have implemented certain policies and procedures whereby our executive officers screen each of our transactions for any possible affiliations between the proposed portfolio investment, us, companies controlled by us and our employees and directors. We will not enter into any agreements unless and until we are satisfied that doing so will not raise concerns under the 1940 Act
or, if such concerns exist, we have taken appropriate actions to seek board review and approval or exemptive relief for such transaction. Our Board of Directors reviews these procedures on an annual basis.  

 We have also adopted a Code of Ethics which applies to, among others, our senior officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as all of our officers, directors and employees. Our Code of Ethics requires that all employees and directors avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between an individual s personal interests and our interests. Pursuant to our Code of Ethics, each employee and director must disclose any conflicts of interest, or actions or relationships that might give rise to a conflict, to our Chief Compliance Officer. Our Audit Committee is charged with
approving any waivers under our Code of Ethics. As required by the NASDAQ Global Select Market corporate governance listing standards, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is also required to review and approve any transactions with related parties (as such term is defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K).  

 Information concerning related party transactions is included in the consolidated financial statements and related notes, appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

   RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

 On October 26, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.29 per share for the fourth quarter, payable on December 30, 2016 to shareholders of record as of December 16, 2016.  

   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2016, one debt investment in our portfolio was at a fixed rate, and the remaining 44 debt investments were at variable rates, representing approximately $0.6 million and $415.9 million in principal debt, respectively. At September 30, 2016, all of our variable rate investments were income producing. The variable rates are based upon the five-year Treasury note, the Prime rate or LIBOR, and, in the case of our bilateral investments, are generally reset annually, whereas our non-bilateral investments generally reset quarterly. We
expect that future debt investments will generally be made at variable rates. Many of the variable rate investments contain floors.  

 To illustrate the potential impact of a change in the underlying interest rate on our net investment income as it pertains to our debt portfolio, we have assumed a 1% increase in the underlying five-year Treasury note, the Prime rate or LIBOR, and no other change in our portfolio as of September 30, 2016. We have also assumed outstanding variable rate borrowings of $206 million. Under this analysis, net investment income would increase by $1.3 million on an annualized basis, reflecting the amount of investments in our portfolio which have implied floors that would be unaffected by a 1% change in the underlying interest rate.
However, if the increase in rates was more significant, such as 5%, the net effect on net investment income would be an increase of approximately $9.8 million. To the extent that the rate underlying certain investments, as well as our borrowings, is at an historic low, it is not possible for the underlying rate to decrease by 1% or 5%. If the underlying rate decreased to 0%, it would have a minimal effect on net investment income. Although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity, it does not adjust for changes in the credit quality, size and composition of our portfolio, and other business developments, including a change in the level of our borrowings, that could affect the net increase (or decrease) in net assets resulting from operations. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis.  

 In addition, to illustrate the impact of a change in the underlying interest rate on our core net investment income as it pertains to our CLO equity investments, we have assumed a 1% increase in the underlying three-month LIBOR, and no other change in our CLO portfolio, or to any of the credit, spread, default rate or other factors, as of September 30, 2016. Under this analysis, the effect on core net investment income would be a decrease of approximately $4.3 million on an annualized basis, reflecting the portfolio assets held within these CLO vehicles which have implied floors that would be unaffected by a 1% change in the
underlying interest rate, compared to the debt carried by those CLO vehicles which are at variable rates and which would be affected by a change in three-month LIBOR. If the increase in three-month LIBOR was more significant, such as 5%, the net effect on core net investment income would be an increase of approximately $4.4 million. Although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity, it does not adjust for changes in any of the other assumptions that effect the return on CLO equity investments, both positively and negatively (and which could accompany changes to the three-month LIBOR rate), such as default rates, recovery rates, prepayment rates and reinvestment rates, that could affect the net increase (or decrease) in net assets resulting from operations. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis.  

 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates.

   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 As of September 30, 2016 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures.  

 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

   PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  

 We and our consolidated subsidiaries are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we and our consolidated subsidiaries may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.  

   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.  

 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. There have been no
material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the risk factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

   ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.  

 Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities  

 We did not engage in unregistered sales of equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and we did not issue shares of common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, as part of our dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders, our dividend reinvestment administrator purchased 73,401 shares of our common stock for $0.4 million in the open market to satisfy the reinvestment portion of our dividends.

MEETINGS . 

(a)          General .
The Chairman of the Board, the president or the Board of Directors may call a special meeting of the stockholders. Subject to subsection
(b) of this Section 3, a special meeting of stockholders shall also be called by the secretary of the Corporation upon the written
request of the stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting. 

(b)           Stockholder
Requested Special Meetings . 

(1)         Any
stockholder of record seeking to have stockholders request a special meeting shall, by sending written notice to the secretary
(the  Record Date Request Notice ) by registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors to fix
a record date to determine the stockholders entitled to request a special meeting (the  Request Record Date ). The Record
Date Request Notice shall set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it, shall be signed by
one or more stockholders of record as of the date of signature (or their duly authorized agents), shall bear the date of signature
of each such stockholder (or such agent) and shall set forth all information relating to each such stockholder that must be disclosed
in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), or
is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A (or any successor provision) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Upon receiving the Record Date Request Notice, the Board of Directors may fix
a Request Record Date. The Request Record Date shall not precede and shall not be more than ten days after the close of business
on the date on which the resolution fixing the Request Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors,
within ten days after the date on which a valid Record Date Request Notice is received, fails to adopt a resolution fixing the
Request Record Date and make a public announcement of such Request Record Date, the Request Record Date shall be the close of business
on the tenth day after the first date on which the Record Date Request Notice is received by the secretary. 

(2)         In
order for any stockholder to request a special meeting, one or more written requests for a special meeting signed by stockholders
of record (or their duly authorized agents) as of the Request Record Date entitled to cast not less than a majority (the  Special
Meeting Percentage ) of all of the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting (the  Special Meeting Request ) shall
be delivered to the secretary. In addition, the Special Meeting Request shall set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters
proposed to be acted on at it (which shall be limited to the matters set forth in the Record Date Request Notice received by the
secretary), shall bear the date of signature of each such stockholder (or such agent) signing the Special Meeting Request, shall
set forth the name and address, as they appear in the Corporation s books, of each stockholder signing such request (or on
whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is signed) and the class, series and number of all shares of stock of the Corporation
which are owned by each such stockholder, and the nominee holder for, and number of, shares owned beneficially but not of record,
shall be sent to the secretary by registered mail, return receipt requested, and shall be received by the secretary within 60 days
after the Request Record Date. Any requesting stockholder may revoke his, her or its request for a special meeting at any time
by written revocation delivered to the secretary. 

(3)         The
secretary shall inform the requesting stockholders of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing the notice of meeting
(including the Corporation s proxy materials). The secretary shall not be required to call a special meeting upon stockholder
request and such meeting shall not be held unless, in addition to the documents required by subsection (b)(2) of this Section
3, the secretary receives payment of such reasonably estimated cost prior to the mailing of any notice of the meeting. 

(4)          Except
as provided in the next sentence, any special meeting shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by the Chairman
of the Board, the president or the Board of Directors, whoever has called the meeting. In the case of any special meeting called
by the secretary upon the request of stockholders (a  Stockholder Requested Meeting ), such meeting shall be held at
such place, date and time as may be designated by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the date of any Stockholder Requested
Meeting shall be not more than 90 days after the record date for such meeting (the  Meeting Record Date  and provided
further that if the Board of Directors fails to designate, within ten days after the date that a valid Special Meeting Request
is actually received by the secretary (the  Delivery Date ), a date and time for a Stockholder Requested Meeting, then
such meeting shall be held at 2:00 p.m. local time on the 90th day after the Meeting Record Date or, if such 90th day is not a
Business Day (as defined below), on the first preceding Business Day; and provided further that in the event that the Board of
Directors fails to designate a place for a Stockholder Requested Meeting within ten days after the Delivery Date, then such meeting
shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation. In fixing a date for any special meeting, the Chairman of the
Board, the president or the Board of Directors may consider such factors as he, she or it deems relevant within the good faith
exercise of business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the matters to be considered, the facts and circumstances
surrounding any request for meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an annual meeting or a special meeting. In the
case of any Stockholder Requested Meeting, if the Board of Directors fails to fix a Meeting Record Date that is a date within 30
days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on the 30th day after the Delivery Date shall be the Meeting Record Date. 

(5)          If
written revocations of requests for the special meeting have been delivered to the Secretary and the result is that stockholders
of record (or their agents duly authorized in writing), as of the Request Record Date, entitled to cast less than the Special Meeting

of meeting has not already been mailed, refrain from mailing the notice of the meeting and send to all requesting stockholders
who have not revoked such requests written notice of any revocation of a request for the special meeting, or (ii) if the notice
of meeting has been mailed and if the Secretary first sends to all requesting stockholders who have not revoked requests for a
special meeting written notice of any revocation of a request for the special meeting and written notice of the Secretary s
intention to revoke the notice of the meeting, revoke the notice of the meeting at any time before ten days before the commencement
of the meeting. Any request for a special meeting received after a revocation by the Secretary of a notice of a meeting shall be
considered a request for a new special meeting. 

(6)         The
Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the president may appoint independent inspectors of elections to act as the agent
of the Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of any purported Special Meeting
Request received by the secretary. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no such purported request
shall be deemed to have been delivered to the secretary until the earlier of (i) five Business Days after receipt by the secretary
of such purported request and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the valid requests received
by the secretary represent at least the Special Meeting Percentage. Nothing contained in this subsection (6) shall in any way be
construed to suggest or imply that the Corporation or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any request,
whether during or after such five Business Day period, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement,
prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation). 

(7)          For purposes
of these Bylaws,  Business Day  shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which banking institutions
in the State of New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 

Section 4.           NOTICE
OF MEETINGS . Written or printed notice of the purpose or purposes, in the case of a special meeting, and of the time and place
of every meeting of the stockholders shall be given by the secretary of the Corporation to each stockholder of record entitled

notice by electronic mail or any other electronic means at least ten days, but not more than 90 days, prior to the date designated
for the meeting, addressed to each stockholder at such stockholder s address appearing on the books of the Corporation or
supplied by the stockholder to the Corporation for the purpose of notice. The notice of any meeting of stockholders may be accompanied
by a form of proxy approved by the Board of Directors in favor of the actions or persons as the Board of Directors may select.
Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be deemed waived by any stockholder who attends the meeting in person or by proxy or
who before or after the meeting submits a signed waiver of notice that is filed with the records of the meeting. 

Any business of the
Corporation may be transacted at an annual meeting of stockholders without being specifically designated in the notice of such
meeting, except such business as is required by any statute to be stated in such notice. No business shall be transacted at a special
meeting of stockholders except as specifically designated in the notice of such meeting. 

Section 5.           ORGANIZATION
AND CONDUCT . Every meeting of stockholders shall be conducted by an individual appointed by the Board of Directors to be chairman
of the meeting or, in the absence of such appointment, by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or, in the case of a vacancy in the
office or absence of the Chairman of the Board, by one of the following officers present at the meeting: the Vice Chairman of the
Board, if any, the chief executive officer, the president, any vice president, the secretary, the treasurer or, in the absence
of such officers, a chairman chosen by the stockholders by the vote of a majority of the votes cast by stockholders present in
person or by proxy. The secretary or, in the secretary s absence, an assistant secretary or, in the absence of both the secretary
and assistant secretaries, an individual appointed by the Board of Directors or, in the absence of such appointment, an individual
appointed by the chairman of the meeting shall act as secretary. In the event that the secretary presides at a meeting of the stockholders,
an assistant secretary, or, in the absence of assistant secretaries, an individual appointed by the Board of Directors or the chairman
of the meeting, shall record the minutes of the meeting. The order of business and all other matters of procedure at any meeting
of stockholders shall be determined by the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting may prescribe such rules, regulations
and procedures and take such action as, in the discretion of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting,
including, without limitation, (a) restricting admission to the time set for the commencement of the meeting; (b) limiting attendance
at the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized proxies or other such individuals as the chairman
of the meeting may determine; (c) limiting participation at the meeting on any matter to stockholders of record of the Corporation
entitled to vote on such matter, their duly authorized proxies or other such individuals as the chairman of the meeting may determine;
(d) limiting the time allotted to questions or comments by participants; (e) maintaining order and security at the meeting; (f)
removing any stockholder or any other individual who refuses to comply with meeting procedures, rules or guidelines as set forth
by the chairman of the meeting; and (g) recessing or adjourning the meeting to a later date and time and place announced at the
meeting. Unless otherwise determined by the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held
in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure. 

Section 6.           QUORUM .
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to cast a majority of the votes
entitled to be cast (without regard to class) shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the stockholders, except with respect
to any such matter that, under applicable statutes or regulatory requirements, requires approval by a separate vote of one or more
classes of stock, in which case the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares entitled to cast a majority of the
votes entitled to be cast by each such class on such a matter shall constitute a quorum. 

If, however, such quorum
shall not be present at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting or the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting, present in person or by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time to a date not more than 120
days after the original record date without notice other than announcement at the meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a
quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. 

The stockholders present
either in person or by proxy, at a meeting which has been duly called and convened, may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. 

Section 7.           VOTING . 

(a)           Voting
Standard for Election of Directors .  Except as set forth below, election of directors at all meetings of the stockholders
at which directors are to be elected shall be by ballot, and a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called
and at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to elect a director. Each share may be voted for as many individuals as there
are directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted. For purposes of this Bylaw, a majority of
votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted  for  a director s election exceeds 50% of the number of
votes cast with respect to that director s election. Votes cast shall include direction to withhold authority in each case
and exclude abstentions with respect to that director s election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a  contested
election  of directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders
duly called and at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this Bylaw, a  contested election  shall mean any election
of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected, with the
determination thereof being made by the Secretary as of the close of the applicable notice of nomination period set forth in Section
11 of this Article II or under applicable law, based on whether one or more notice(s) of nomination were timely filed in accordance
with said Section 11;  provided , that the determination that an election is a  contested election  shall be determinative
only as to the timeliness of a notice of nomination and not otherwise as to its validity. If, prior to the time the Corporation
mails its initial proxy statement in connection with such election of directors, one or more notices of nomination are withdrawn
such that the number of candidates for election as director no longer exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the election
shall not be considered a contested election, but in all other cases, once an election is determined to be a contested election,
directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. 

(b)           Resignation
of Directors .  If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected and no successor has been elected
at such meeting, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee (if such a committee has been constituted) shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether
to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the
tendered resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee s recommendation (if any), and
publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means
of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the
date of the certification of the election results. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in making its recommendation,
and the Board of Directors in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate
and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation. If such incumbent
director s resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual
meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director s resignation
is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Bylaw, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not
an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions
of Section 11 of Article III of these Bylaws or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section
2 of Article III of these Bylaws. 

(c)           Vote
Required in Other Matters .  A majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a
quorum is present shall be sufficient to approve any matters other than the election of directors that may properly come before
the meeting, unless more than a majority of the votes cast is required by statute or by the charter of the Corporation. Unless
otherwise provided in the charter, each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted
to a vote at a meeting of stockholders. 

Section 8.           PROXIES .
A stockholder may cast the votes entitled to be cast by the shares of stock owned of record by the stockholder in person or by
proxy executed by the stockholder or by the stockholder s duly authorized agent in any manner permitted by law. Such proxy
or evidence of authorization of such proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the Corporation before or at the meeting. No proxy
shall be valid more than eleven months after its date unless otherwise provided in the proxy. 

Section 9.           VOTING
OF STOCK BY CERTAIN HOLDERS . Stock of the Corporation registered in the name of a corporation, partnership, trust or other
entity, if entitled to be voted, may be voted by the president or a vice president, a general partner or trustee thereof, as the
case may be, or a proxy appointed by any of the foregoing individuals, unless some other person who has been appointed to vote
such stock pursuant to a bylaw or a resolution of the governing body of such corporation or other entity or agreement of the partners
of a partnership presents a certified copy of such bylaw, resolution or agreement, in which case such person may vote such stock.
Any director or other fiduciary may vote stock registered in his or her name as such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy. 

Shares of stock of
the Corporation directly or indirectly owned by it shall not be voted at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the
total number of outstanding shares entitled to be voted at any given time, unless they are held by it in a fiduciary capacity,
in which case they may be voted and shall be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time. 

The Board of Directors
may adopt by resolution a procedure by which a stockholder may certify in writing to the Corporation that any shares of stock registered
in the name of the stockholder are held for the account of a specified person other than the stockholder. The resolution shall
set forth the class of stockholders who may make the certification, the purpose for which the certification may be made, the form
of certification and the information to be contained in it; if the certification is with respect to a record date or closing of
the stock transfer books, the time after the record date or closing of the stock transfer books within which the certification
must be received by the Corporation; and any other provisions with respect to the procedure which the Board of Directors considers
necessary or desirable. On receipt of such certification, the person specified in the certification shall be regarded as, for the
purposes set forth in the certification, the stockholder of record of the specified stock in place of the stockholder who makes
the certification. 

Section 10.          INSPECTORS .
The Board of Directors, in advance of any meeting, may, but need not, appoint one or more individual inspectors or one or more
entities that designate individuals as inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. If an inspector or inspectors
are not appointed, the person presiding at the meeting may, but need not, appoint one or more inspectors. In case any person who
may be appointed as an inspector fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Board of Directors
in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the chairman of the meeting. The inspectors, if any, shall determine the number
of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity
and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in
connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, and determine the result, and do such acts
as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders. Each such report shall be in writing and signed
by him or her or by a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more than one inspector,
the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors. The report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of shares
represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall be  prima   facie  evidence thereof.
