  Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements  
  September 30, 2016  
   
  NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION   
   
 The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of September30, 2016, and for all periods presented herein, have been made. 
   
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted.  Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period, as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted. It is suggested that these unaudited interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s December 31, 2015 audited financial statements.  The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. 
   
  NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company s unaudited interim financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. These factors raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 
   
 In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. 
   
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  NOTE 3   RELATED PARTY TRANSATIONS  
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received advances from related parties totaling $14,300 to fund operations. The advances are non-interest bearing and due on demand. There was $15,075 and $775 due to related parties as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
   
 On April 20, 2016, the Company entered into a lease extension agreement with a related party to extend the term of the lease for a period of three years for consideration of $10 cash. The original lease was entered into on October 1, 2013 and set to expire on October 1, 2016. The extension is under the same terms as the original lease agreement and will expire on October 1, 2019. 
   
  NOTE 4   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  
   
 Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company received loans from related parties totaling $1,500 to fund operations. The loans are non-interest bearing and due on demand consistent with prior related party loans as discussed in  Note 3   Related Party Transactions .

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
   
 This Form 10-Q includes  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-Q which address activities, events or developments which the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof); finding suitable merger or acquisition candidates; expansion and growth of the Company's business and operations; and other such matters are forward-looking statements.  These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. However, whether actual results or developments will conform with the Company's expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including general economic, market and business conditions; the business opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented to and pursued by the Company; changes in laws or regulation; and other factors, most of which are beyond the control of the Company. 
   
 These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of predictive, future-tense or forward-looking terminology, such as  believes,   anticipates,   expects,   estimates,   plans,   may,   will,  or similar terms. These statements appear in a number of places in this Filing and include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company, and its directors or its officers with respect to, among other things: (i) trends affecting the Company's financial condition or results of operations for its limited history; (ii) the Company's business and growth strategies; and, (iii) the Company's financing plans. Investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such factors that could adversely affect actual results and performance include, but are not limited to, the Company's limited operating history, potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results and expenses, government regulation, technological change and competition. 
   
 Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequence to or effects on the Company or its business or operations. The Company assumes no obligations to update any such forward-looking statements. 
   
  General Business Development  
   
 The Company was formed on September 26, 2013 in the State of Colorado.  
   
  Business Strategy  
   
 The Company was incorporated in September 2013. Our business model is to purchase or trade stock for oil and gas properties to be held as long term assets. Oil and gas commodity pricing has stabilized under the current economic market conditions bringing the U.S. to become the number one producer in the world. The momentum to drill using enhanced drilling technology in previously undeveloped areas assures the continued value of these properties. Our lean operating structure positions us well to compete in this very competitive market. Our strategy is to acquire producing properties that the Company can operate which have proven un-drilled locations available for further development. At this time the Company is reviewing several properties but have no contractual commitments to date.  Our management s years of experience and knowledge of the oil and gas industry leads us to believe that there are an abundance of good drilling prospects available that have either been overlooked or are not big enough for the larger companies. In the process of identifying these drilling prospects, the Company will utilize the expertise of existing management and employ the highest caliber contract engineering firms available to further evaluate the properties. To qualify for acquisition, the calculated cash flow after taxes and operating expenses, including ten percent (10%) interest per year, will recover the acquisition cost in 22 to 30 months. The cash flow calculation will be based conservatively on $51 per barrel of oil and $2.89 per MCF of gas. In addition, the selection criteria will require the life of current producing wells to be 7 years or longer and the field must have a minimum total life of 15 years. 

9 

In the first phase intend on concentrating on prospects in eastern Colorado, western Kansas and southern Wyoming. The depth of the wells in the target areas average from 1500 ft. for the Niobrara formation to a total depth of 5800 ft. for the Topeka, Heebner, Lansing-Kansas City, Marmaton, Cherokee, Atoka, Morrow, Mississippian, Spergen, and Osage formations. By concentrating our initial efforts on shallower prospects we minimize drilling and operating costs. As we grow we plan to expand into the Front Range (Northern Front Range Outcrop) and Denver Basin Province (D-J Basin, Wattenberg) of Colorado and into western Kansas (Hugoton Embayment Anadarko Basin   Central Kansas Uplift). The wells in these areas range from 4,000 ft. to 10,000 ft. Such wells are more expensive to drill and operate, but also offer bigger returns. Some of the formations in these areas are the Sussex, Niobrara, Codell, J Sand and the D Sand formations. The Company intends to  develop prospects and intends to obtain partners to participate in the costs of drilling or acquisitions with the Company serving as the designated Operator.  The Company will also retain a royalty or working interest in the wells drilled or acquired. 
   
 The Company has engaged in verbal nnegotiations for acquisition of oil and Gas leases located in Northern and eastern Colorado basins. 
   
 In the second phase of operations, we intend to expand into Oklahoma, Texas, and eastern Kansas. We intend to place a great deal of emphasis on natural gas production and the transportation of natural gas. We believe natural gas will be the fuel of the future for automobiles, trucks and buses because of the clean-air standards that are proposed and will soon be going into effect, and now is an ideal time to acquire natural gas assets due to the current pricing matrix. The Company also plans on acquiring field transportation and short haul lines as part of our future business plan expansion. Acquiring these types of company lines, specifically in the areas where the company will have production located, will be advantageous due to savings in internal transportation costs, and the profitability margins of operating the lines and marketing natural gas. Managing the transportation system, in conjunction with field operations, will enhance cash flow. After obtaining the transportation lines, we hope to then develop our own end-users for natural gas. This will further enhance the profit margin of the company. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had $227 in cash, total current assets of $38,409 and total current liabilities of $31,373 creating a working capital surplus of $7,036. Current assets consisted of $227 in cash and $2,750 of prepaid expenses. Current liabilities consisted of $16,298 of accounts payable and $15,075 of current related party notes payable.  
   
  Going Concern  
   
 The future of our company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement and public offering of its common stock, if necessary. See note 2 to the financial statements for additional information.  
   
  Results of Operations  
   
 We did not generate revenues during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. Total operating expenses were $9,665 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,705 during the same period in 2015. The increase is the result of fees associated with the acquisition and upkeep of our leases. Total operating expenses were $18,230 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $12,019 for the same period in 2015. The increase is the result of incurring of fees associated with the acquisition and upkeep of our leases that did not exist during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
   
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
 In Financial Reporting release No. 60,  CAUTIONARY ADVICE REGARDING DISCLOSURE ABOUT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  ( FRR 60 ), the Securities and Exchange Commission suggested that companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. In FRR 60, the SEC defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and operating results, and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.  Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include: non-cash compensation valuation that affects the total expenses reported in the current period and the valuation of shares and underlying mineral rights acquired with shares. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying these most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements.

  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
  ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
   
 As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  1934 Act ), as of March 31, 2015, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), who concluded, that because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting ( ICFR ) described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016.  
   
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our second quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
