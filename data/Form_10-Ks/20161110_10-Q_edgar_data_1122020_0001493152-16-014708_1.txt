NOTE
1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS    

PCS
Edventures.com, Inc. (the Company) develops and markets STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) education products
comprised of curriculum and materials. With its acquisition of Thrust-UAV in February, 2016, the Company is also in late-stage
development of a first person view (FPV) racing drone, which it intends to assemble and market primarily through distributors.
The Company has used this racing-drone technology to create an education drone (also FPV) for the classroom to be used as a platform
to teach STEAM topics. This initiative is also in late stage development. The Company sells its education products into all 50
U.S. states as well as into international markets. Most of the Company s domestic education business is conducted with schools
and entities that cater to after-school programs for students. Most of the Company s international business is conducted
with governmental agencies in that local market. The Company anticipates revenue from its FPV racing drone to come from both domestic
and international sources. The Company expects that the vast majority of its education drone sales will be domestic. The Company
anticipates recognizing its first meaningful revenues from its FPV racing drone division during its third fiscal quarter of 2017.  

The
financial statements presented herein are those of the Company.  

In
October 1994, the Company exchanged common stock on a one-for-one basis for common stock of PCS Schools, Inc. As a result of this
exchange, PCS Schools, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In the late 1990s, the Company divested the stand-alone
learning labs to focus on the creation of turn-key lab modules coupled with web-based technology for use in the classroom and
afterschool programs.  

On
March 27, 2000, the Company changed its name from PCS Education Systems, Inc. to PCS Edventures!. com, Inc.  

In
August 2001, the Company successfully completed an SB-2 registration filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
and began trading publicly on the OTC Bulletin Board.  

On
November 30, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with 511092 N.B. LTD., a Canadian corporation (LabMentors), to exchange
the Company s common stock for common stock of 511092 N.B. LTD., which exchange was completed in December, 2005, with LabMentors
becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary. In December 2005, the name of this subsidiary was formally changed to PCS LabMentors, Ltd..
The Company divested LabMentors, the wholly-owned subsidiary, in August of 2013.  

In
January, 2012, the Company committed to a business plan enhancement, which included the opening, operating, and licensing of EdventuresLab
private learning centers and launched a pilot program in the spring of 2012. An additional LeraningLab was opened in Eagle, Idaho
in June of 2014.  

On
January 31, 2013, the Company formed a subsidiary called Premiere Science, Inc., incorporated and registered in the State of Idaho.
The subsidiary is 100% wholly-owned by the Company and was formed to use as an additional sales and marketing tool to gain other
business opportunities. There were no operations for the subsidiary during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

On
September 26, 2014, the shareholders voted for the proposal to grant the Board of Directors the authority to change the name of
the Company in a fashion that will remove the  .com  from its name, but retain the current brand.  

On
July 23, 2015, the Board of Directors resolved that the name of the Company be changed to PCS Edventures!, Inc. No amendment to
the Company s Articles of Incorporation regarding this name change has been filed, although the Company anticipates that,
following the assignment of a new Cusip Number and the required filing with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ),
this name change will become effective.  

On
February 15, 2016, the Company acquired Thrust-UAV, a private company engaged in the development and assembly of FPV racing drones,
for $109,000.  

NOTE
2 - UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

The
September 30, 2016, financial statements presented herein are unaudited, and in the opinion of management, include all adjustments
(consisting of only normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations
and cash flows. Such financial statements do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2016.  

The
operating results for the six-month period ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.  

NOTE
3 - GOING CONCERN    

The
Company s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The established sources of revenues are not presently sufficient to cover the Company s operating costs. The
Company has accumulated significant losses, accounts payable and generated negative cash flows. The combination of these
items raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans to alleviate this adverse
position are as follows:  

The
Company s strategy to remove the going concern doubt is to focus attention on increasing STEAM education sales through both
channel partners and its direct sales force, and to bring to market its FPV racing drone and STEAM education drone product lines
from Thrust-UAV. The Company expects its first revenues from its FPV racing drone and STEAM education drone during Q3FY2017.

Price ) as consideration for the issuance of a promissory note in the amount of $400,000 from the Company. These warrants
are fully vested and exercisable. The warrants were evaluated for embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC 815 and were found
to not include any embedded derivatives. The warrants attached to the note were valued using the Black Scholes Valuation Model.
The assumptions used in the model included the historical volatility of the Company s stock of 180%, and the risk-free rate
for the periods within the expected life of the warrant based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect of 0.35%. The resulting
fair value was $66,717. This value was recorded as a debt discount and fully amortized as of March 31, 2016. On June 8, 2016,

note of $135,000 was combined with the $40,000 remaining principal on the April 20, 2015, note into a $175,000 note due January
15, 2019. The accrued interest on the $175,000 note, on September 30, 2016, was $31,766.

for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $312,299 as compared to revenue during the quarter ended September 30, 2015,
of $524,807. The decrease in revenue was due to $190,655 less in domestic sales and a $19,693 decrease in Learning Center sales.  

Operating expenses increased by $125,647
(23%) and $231,430 (22%) in the three and six months of fiscal 2017, respectively, relative to prior year periods. The largest
factor behind this increase in operating expenses was the Company s acquisition of Thrust-UAV which increased Company overhead.
Product development expense increased significantly due to investment in research and development at Thrust-UAV. 

Interest
expense decreased by $12,917 and $62,662 in the three and first six months of fiscal 2017, respectively, relative to prior year
periods due to the conversion of debt.  

Liquidity    

Cash used by operations for the second quarter
of fiscal 2017 was $537,421, compared to cash provided by operations of $38,571 in the same period last year. The Company ended
the second quarter of fiscal 2016 with $311,659 in cash, total current assets of $954,547, and total current liabilities
of $1,341,756, resulting in a working capital deficit of $387,209 compared to a working capital deficit of $1,661,514
for the year ended March 31, 2016. 

The
Company had a current ratio at September 30, 2016, and March 31, 2016, of .70 and .42, respectively. Significant short
term debt was consolidated with an extended due date reclassifying the promissory notes from short term to long term, related
party debt. There is no guarantee that this lender will continue to provide extensions for payments and the Company cannot predict
that it will be successful in obtaining funding or generating cash in order to pay the lender. The Company has an accumulated
deficit of ($41,172,410) and shareholders  equity (deficit) of ($1,865,709).

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

The
Company maintains  disclosure controls and procedures,  as the SEC defines such terms. We have designed these controls
and procedures to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such
as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms. We have also designed our disclosure controls to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President, and Vice President/Treasurer, as appropriate, to allow
them to make timely decisions regarding our required disclosures.  

Management
has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange
Act as of September 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President, and the Vice President/Treasurer,
acting as principal financial officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, including the accumulation
and communication of disclosures to the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President, and Vice President/Treasurer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, were not effective as of this date to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. The Company s
quarter-end closing process did not adequately ensure that all transactions were accounted for in accordance with GAAP and that
required adjustments were made to the financial statements to prevent them from being materially misstated. Management acknowledges
that as a smaller reporting entity, it is difficult to have adequate accounting staff to perform appropriate additional reviews
of the financial statements.  

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  .   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes.  

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Management,
including our Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President, and our Vice President/Treasurer, acting as principal financial
officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error or fraud.
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
Management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  

Management,
with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer, as principal executive officer, Executive Vice President, and the Vice
President/Treasurer, acting as principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control   Integrated Framework.
Consistent with its review for the year ending March 31, 2016, when management identified a material weakness in the internal
control over financial reporting, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting was not comprehensive.  

This
material weakness was evidenced through the Company s year-end closing process, which did not adequately ensure that all
transactions were accounted for in accordance with GAAP and that required adjustments were made to the financial statements to
prevent them from being materially misstated. Based on this evaluation, our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive
Officer, Executive Vice President and Principal Financial Officer, in this case, our Vice President, concluded, as of March 31,
2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Management acknowledges that as a smaller reporting entity,
it is difficult to have adequate accounting staff to perform appropriate additional reviews of the financial statements.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION    

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

On
or about May 18, 2015, the Company was named as a co-defendant in a legal action related to one of its employees, alleged to have
been driving an automobile negligently while on work related services for the Company, and causing damages to the plaintiffs in
the action. The action was brought in the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, in and for the
County of Ada, Civil Action number CV PI 1507419. The Company engaged legal counsel to represent it in this matter. On October
25, 2016, the judge presiding over this case dismissed it with prejudice.  

On
October 13, 2015, the Company filed a Summons and Complaint against a person the Company contracted to promote the Company. The
complaint primarily involved defamation and breach of contract. The Complaint was unresolved at quarter end as the Company was
in negotiations with the person to settle this dispute. In early October, an agreement was reached and both parties signed a confidential
agreement. The matter was settled amicably.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors.   

The
Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and is not required to provide the information
required under this item.  

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   

Security
issuances occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

*    Issued as
 restricted securities  under the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan; the shares issuable thereunder are Registered on Form
S-8 of the SEC.  

**   The
                                         Company issued these securities to persons who were either  accredited investors 
                                         or  sophisticated investors  as those terms are respectively defined in Rules
                                         501 and 506(b) of the SEC; and each person had prior access to all material information
                                         about us. We believe that the offer and sale of these securities was exempt from the
                                         registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities
                                         Act ), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof.

Dear
Client:  

This
letter is to confirm the terms and objectives for our tax services engagement and clarify the nature and limitations of the tax
services to be provided.  

We
will prepare the 2015 corporate federal and state income tax returns from information you will furnish to us. We will not be preparing
other tax returns which you may be required to file.  

By
your signature below you are confirming to us that the information you are supplying to us is accurate and complete to the best
of your knowledge and that your expenses for meals, entertainment, travel, gifts, and vehicle use are supported by records as
required by law. We will not audit or otherwise verify the data you submit, although we may need to ask you for clarification
of some of the information. Your signature on this engagement letter acknowledges your understanding of the documentation requirements
established by law for substantiation of meals, entertainment, travel, gifts and vehicle use.  

Our
work in connection with the preparation of your income tax returns does not include any procedures designed to discover defalcations
or other irregularities, should any exist. Management is responsible for the proper recording of transactions and for the substantial
accuracy of the financial records provided to us.  

We
will prepare your tax returns using tax accounting principles most favorable to you, so long as we shall, in good faith, believe
that the position so taken has a realistic possibility of being sustained administratively or judicially, if challenged. If we
report an item or transaction based upon a conflicting authority that favors you, as opposed to the IRS, the possibility exists
the IRS may disagree with our position. The IRS could assess a penalty if you overvalue an item, inadvertently omit information
or a transaction, or take a position contrary to the IRS. Currently the IRS is aggressive in assessing penalties. We do not assume
responsibility for such assessments and you have the final responsibility for the overall correctness of your return.  

Your
returns are, of course, subject to review by the taxing authorities. Any items resolved against you by the examining agent are
subject to certain rights of appeal. In the event of such an examination, we will be available to represent you at your request.
Such representation, however, shall be deemed a separate engagement and our fees will be based upon our normal hourly rates.
