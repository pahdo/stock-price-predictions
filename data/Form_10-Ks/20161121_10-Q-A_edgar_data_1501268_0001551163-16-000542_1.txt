  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   
  (UNAUDITED)  
   
  NOTE 1 - CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at September 30, 2016, and for all periods presented herein, have been made. 
   
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's December 31, 2015 audited consolidated financial statements.  The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years. 
   
  NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 
   
 In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. 
   
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  NOTE 3     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  (UNAUDITED)  
   
  NOTE 3     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  
   
  Loss per Common Share  
   
 Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share include the dilutive effect, if any, from the potential exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no dilutive common equivalent shares. For the nine months ended, September 30, 2016, and for the year ended December 31, 2015, convertible preferred stock in the amount of 28,021,796, were excluded from loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. 
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 The Company has evaluated recent accounting pronouncements and their adoption has not had or is not expected to have a material impact on the Company   s financial position, or statements. 
   
  NOTE 4- RELATED PARTY   
   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company is indebted to Company Officers and entities controlled by Officers for services, periodic advances to the Company and expenses paid for on the Company's behalf.  Of the amount owing of $123,586 at September 30, 2016, an Officer of the Company paid net expenses of $63,006 on behalf of the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

ITEM 2  
  Management   s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
   
  Disclaimer Regarding Forward Looking Statements  
   
 Our Management   s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operations contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking.  Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky.  These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
   
 Although the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them.  Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements.  You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects. 
   
  Overview of the Company   s Formation and Recent Events  
   
 We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 29, 2008, under the name Horizontal Marketing Corp. for the purpose of providing marketing services to companies and individuals. Since inception we have only realized marginal revenues from operations, with none of those revenues in the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our efforts, to date, have focused primarily on the development and implementation of our business plan.  Currently, we lack the resources required to effectively develop a digital publishing business and, therefore, have been engaged in a search for a strategic business partner or a merger or acquisition partner with the resources to establish a business and provide greater value to its stockholders. 
   
 According to our prior management   s disclosure in our prior periodic filings, as well as our disclosure in this quarterly report (including the cover page of this quarterly report) we have not had any material business or operations and under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, therefore we have historically been a    shell company    and will be until we either develop business operations organically or acquire an operating business.  We are considered a    shell company    because we have no or nominal assets and nor or nominal operations and no employees.  Historically, we have been actively seeking to acquire assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business that generates revenues, in exchange for our securities.  Our purpose was to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to us by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages our company may offer.  Although we have entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of bNET Communications, Inc. (see below), that transaction has not closed and until it closes or we find another company to acquire or develop new operations organically, we will be a    shell company   . 

I. 
  Agreement to Acquire the Assets of bNET Communications, Inc . 
   
 On November 30, 2012, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreements (the    Bnet Asset Purchase Agreement   ) with bNET Communications, Inc., a Nevada corporation (   BNET   ), pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase BNET   s digital media library in exchange for shares of our common stock. BNET operates bnetTV.com, and bnetTV.com, Inc., a content aggregator, internet broadcasting, publishing company and accredited media organization, that creates and distributes video content pertaining to new technology, primarily at corporate and consumer events, trade shows and conferences. bnetTV.com, Inc., has been streaming live broadcasts of corporate annual meetings over the internet for many large and small firms and broadcasting awards shows for various industries. 
   
 Due to the length of time required by BNET to satisfy the conditions precedent to Closing the Bnet Asset Purchase Agreement, on April 9, 2014, the parties entered into an Amendment to update specific provisions based on certain events that have transpired since the parties first entered into the agreement. Specifically, the total number of shares of our Common Stock issued to BNET was 54,000,000 shares to give effect to our change in capitalization as a result of the 16-for-1 forward stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock effective in June 2013.  While some of the conditions precedent to closing have been satisfied, the closing is still subject to a number of conditions, among which required that BNET provide us with (1) audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended that now include December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, along with a the audit report, with respect to the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, issued by a PCAOB registered firm; (2) a report of the value of the bNET Communications Assets established by the independent fair market valuation or the record value at the lower cost of cost or market; and (3) all approvals and clearance from all regulatory authorities with respect to the proposed acquisition. 
   
 bnetTV   s digital media library consists of thousands of recorded conference programs and interviews. bnetTV provides professional video and media content over IP based networks for emerging technology companies and any individuals interested in those companies. 
   
 BNET is principally controlled by Gerald E. Sklar, our Chairman, CEO and Secretary and Anthony Sklar, one of our former officers and directors. As result of Gerald Sklar   s control position, if our proposed acquisition of the bNET Communications assets closes it will be deemed to be a related party transaction and not an arms-length transaction. 
   
 The following discussion analyzes our financial condition and the results of our operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
 This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements included as part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Results of Operations for Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   
   
  Summary of Results of Operations  

Operating Loss; Net Income (Loss)  
   
 Our net income/(loss) decreased from ($176,201) to ($48,565), from the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to September 30, 2016.  Our operating loss decreased by the same amount from ($176,201) to ($48,565) for the same periods. 
   
  Revenue    
   
 We have only had minimal revenues since our inception.  Historically, we have been actively seeking to acquire assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business that generates revenues, in exchange for our securities.  Our purpose was to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to us by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages our company may offer.  Although we have entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of bNET Communications, Inc. (see below), that transaction has not closed and until it closes or we find another company to acquire or develop new operations organically, we will not generate any revenue. 
   
  General and Administrative Expenses    
   
 General and administrative expenses decreased by $39,110, from $41,685 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $2,575 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to an decrease in web hosting, utilities, and trade show expenses. 
   
  Professional fees  
   
 Professional fees increased by $33,757, from $12,233 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $45,990 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  For both periods these amounts are largely due to the amounts we pay our attorneys and auditors as a result of filing periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We expect these fees will increase if we are successful in acquiring or organically growing operations. 
   
   Results of Operations for Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   
   
  Summary of Results of Operations  

Operating Loss; Net Income (Loss)  
   
 Our net income/(loss) decreased by $121,050, from ($200,679) to ($79,174), from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to September 30, 2016.  Our operating loss decreased by the same $121,050, from ($200,679) to ($79,174) for the same periods.  The change in our net income/(loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior year period, is primarily a result of having no executive compensation expense during the period.  We believe these operating and net loss figures are similar to what we expect in the nine-month periods before we are successful in either acquiring an operating business or organically growing a business. 
   
  Revenue    
   
 We have only had minimal revenues since our inception.  Historically, we have been actively seeking to acquire assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business that generates revenues, in exchange for our securities.  Our purpose was to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to us by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages our company may offer.  Although we have entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of bNET Communications, Inc. (see below), that transaction has not closed and until it closes or we find another company to acquire or develop new operations organically, we will not generate any revenue. 
   
  General and Administrative Expenses    
   
 General and administrative expenses decreased by $27,312, from $44,753 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $17,441 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to an decrease in web hosting, utilities, and trade show expenses. 
   
  Professional fees  

Professional fees increased by $28,090 from $33,643 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $61,733 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  For both periods these amounts are largely due to the amounts we pay our attorneys and auditors as a result of filing periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We expect these fees will increase if we are successful in acquiring or organically growing operations. 
   
  Executive compensation  
   
 Executive compensation decreased by $122,283 to -0- for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
   Liquidity and Capital Resources for Nine months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine months Ended September 30, 2015   
   
   Introduction   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, because of our operating losses, we did not generate positive operating cash flows.  Our cash on hand as of September 30, 2016 was $1,105 and our monthly cash flow burn rate is approximately $10,000.  As a result, we have significant short term cash needs.  These needs are being satisfied through proceeds from the sales of our securities and loans from both related parties and third parties.  We will not be able to satisfy our cash needs from our revenues until at least the time we have acquired or organically grown an operating business, and even then there is no guarantee our revenues will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs. 
 Our cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015, respectively, are as follows: 

Our current assets decreased as of September 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015, due to us having less cash on hand as of September 30, 2016.  The decrease in our total assets between the two periods was also related to the decreased cash on hand we had as of September 30, 2016.  Our other assets consisted of a collection of a large ruby animal and other configures and were valued the same at September 30, 2016 as at December 31, 2015. 
   
 Our current liabilities increased by $64,729, as of September 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015.  This increase was primarily due to an increase in our accounts payable-related party of $63,009, and an increase in our accounts payable of $1,723.   
   
 In order to repay our obligations in full or in part when due, we will be required to raise capital from other sources.  There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these efforts.

For the period in 2016, the net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of our net income (loss) of ($79,174), a change in accounts payable of $1,723, and a change in accounts payable     related party of $63,006.

  ITEM 4  
  Controls and Procedures  
   
  (a)   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls Procedures  
   
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Disclosure and control procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer (our Principal Executive Officer) and chief financial officer (our Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives. Additionally, in  

evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures, management is required to apply its reasonable judgment. We also do not have an audit committee. Based on the evaluation described above, and as a result, in part, of not having an audit committee and having one individual serve as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to the same extent as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
 As funds become available to us, we expect to implement additional measures to improve disclosure controls and procedures. 
   
  (b)  
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  
   
 There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
   
  (c)  
  Officer   s Certifications  
   
 Appearing as an exhibit to this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are    Certifications    of our Chief Executive and Financial Officer. The Certifications are required pursuant to Sections 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the    Section 302 Certifications   ). This section of the quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains information concerning the Controls Evaluation referred to in the Section 302 Certifications. This information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.
