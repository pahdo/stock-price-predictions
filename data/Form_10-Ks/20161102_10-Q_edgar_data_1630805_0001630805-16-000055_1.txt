  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 
  SEPTEMBER 30,     2016    

NOTE 1     BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  These interim financial statements of Babcock   Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. ("B W," "we," "us," "our" or "the Company") have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and Securities and Exchange Commission instructions for interim financial information, and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( Annual Report ). Accordingly, significant accounting policies and other disclosures normally provided have been omitted since such items are disclosed in our Annual Report.  
    
  On June 8, 2015, The Babcock   Wilcox Company's ("BWC" or "former Parent") board of directors approved the spin-off of B W through the distribution of shares of B W common stock to holders of BWC common stock (the "spin-off"). On June 30, 2015, B W became a separate publicly-traded company, and BWC did not retain any ownership interest in B W. On and prior to June 30, 2015, our financial position, operating results and cash flows consisted of The Power Generation Operations of BWC ("BW PGG"), which represented a combined reporting entity comprised of the assets and liabilities in managing and operating the Power Generation segment of BWC, combined with related captive insurance operations that were contributed in connection with the spin-off by BWC to B W. In addition, BW PGG also included certain assets and liabilities of BWC's Nuclear Energy ("NE") segment that were transferred to BWC in connection with the spin-off. We have treated the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of the NE business as a discontinued operation in our condensed consolidated and combined financial statements. Refer to   Note 21   for more information about our discontinued operations.  
    
  Through June 30, 2015, certain corporate and general and administrative expenses, including those related to executive management, tax, accounting, legal, information technology, treasury services, and certain employee benefits, have been allocated by BWC to us to reflect all costs of doing business related to these operations in the financial statements, including expenses incurred by related entities on our behalf. Management believes such allocations are reasonable. However, the associated expenses reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated and combined statements of operations may not be indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been operating as an independent public company for the periods presented. Following the spin-off from BWC, we have been performing these functions using internal resources or purchased services, certain of which have been provided by BWC pursuant to a transition services agreement.  
  Refer to   Note 20   for a detailed description of transactions with other affiliates of BWC through June 30, 2015.  
    
  We have included all adjustments, in the opinion of management, consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial statements. We have eliminated all intercompany transactions and accounts. We present the notes to our condensed consolidated and combined financial statements on the basis of continuing operations, unless otherwise stated. 

NOTE 2     CONTRACTS AND REVENUE RECOGNITION 
    
  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded charges of   $14.0 million   and   $45.7 million  , respectively, related to changes in our estimate of forecasted costs to complete a Renewable energy contract in Europe. Management concluded the change in estimate was a result of a deficiency in the piping design detected during the second quarter of 2016, which caused the contract to become a loss contract. During the third quarter of 2016, complexities associated with the nature of the remediation, combined with lower than expected labor efficiencies, extended the anticipated schedule. The project is approximately   79%   complete as of   September 30, 2016  . We expect B W's construction on the project will be completed in early 2017, with remaining commissioning and turnover activities linked to the customer's operation of the facilities through mid-2017. Our estimates of revenues and costs at completion have been, and may continue to be, impacted by our performance and the performance of our subcontractors. Our estimated loss at completion as of   September 30, 2016   represents our best estimate based on current information. As with all estimates to complete used to measure contract revenue, actual results could differ from our estimates. The change in estimate required the reversal of   $6.8 million   of revenue that had been recognized through the first quarter of 2016. In other accrued liabilities on our condensed consolidated and combined balance sheet at   September 30, 2016   is a   $7.8 million   reserve for the estimated loss on this uncompleted contract. During the third quarter of 2016, we determined it was probable that we would receive   100 million   Danish Krones ("DKK") (  $15.0 million  ) insurance recovery for a portion of the losses on this contract, which represents the full amount available under the insurance policy. Accordingly, we recognized the insurance recovery as a reduction in costs

     Table of Contents  

during the third quarter of 2016 and recorded the insurance receivable in accounts receivable - other in the condensed consolidated and combined balance sheet at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  We include claims for extra work or changes in scope of work in contract revenues to the extent of costs incurred and when we believe collection is probable. We recorded   $2.3 million   of claims revenue during the third quarter of 2015 and   $1.2 million   and   $2.3 million   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. In our condensed consolidated and combined balance sheets, we had no accrued claims receivable at   September 30, 2016   and   $2.3 million   of claims receivable at   December 31, 2015  .   

NOTE 3     EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    
  On June 30, 2015,   53,719,878   shares of our common stock were distributed to BWC shareholders to complete our spin-off transaction. The basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding were based on the weighted average number of BWC common shares outstanding for the period ending June 30, 2015, adjusted for a distribution ratio of one share of B W common stock for every   two   shares of BWC common stock.  
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share of our common stock: 

(1)       We excluded   526 thousand   shares from the weighted average shares outstanding to calculate diluted EPS for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as the Company had a net loss during the period. 

NOTE 4     SHARE REPURCHASES 
    
  On August 4, 2015, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an indeterminate number of our shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate market value of up to   $100 million  . We repurchased   1.3 million   shares of our common stock for   $24.3 million   during 2015, and   1.6 million   and   4.1 million   shares of our common stock for   $25.9 million   and   $75.7 million   during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, which completed this program.  
    
  On August 4, 2016, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an indeterminate number of our shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate market value of up to   $100 million   over the next twenty-four

     Table of Contents  

months. As of   November 2, 2016  , we have not made any share repurchases under the August 4, 2016 share repurchase authorization. 
    
  Any shares purchased that were not part of our publicly announced plan are related to repurchases of common stock pursuant to the provisions of employee benefit plans that permit the repurchase of shares to satisfy statutory tax withholding obligations. 

NOTE 5     SPIG ACQUISITION 
  On July 1, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of SPIG S.p.A. ("SPIG")   for    155 million   (approximately   $172.1 million  )   in an all-cash transaction, which was     subject to post-closing adjustments. During September 2016,    2.6 million   (approximately   $2.9 million  ) of the transaction price was returned to B W based on the difference between the actual working capital and pre-close estimates. Transaction costs included in the purchase price associated with closing the acquisition of SPIG on July 1, 2016 were approximately   $0.3 million  .  
    
  Based in Arona, Italy, SPIG is a global provider of custom-engineered comprehensive dry and wet cooling solutions and aftermarket services to the power generation industry including natural gas-fired and renewable energy power plants, as well as downstream oil and gas, petrochemical and other industrial end markets. The acquisition of SPIG is consistent with B W's goal to grow and diversify its technology-based offerings with new products and services that are complementary to our core businesses in the industrial markets.     In the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , SPIG contributed   $38.3 million   of revenue and   $4.2 million   of gross profit to the Industrial segment. 
    
  We accounted for the SPIG acquisition using the acquisition method. All of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Several valuation methods were used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we used the income method, which required us to forecast the expected future net cash flows for each intangible asset. These cash flows were then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the projected cash flows. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset's economic life and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also required judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives, or indefinite useful lives. 
    
  The allocation of the purchase price, based on the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is detailed below. B W is in the process of finalizing the purchase price allocation associated with the valuation of certain intangible assets and deferred tax balances; thus, the provisional measurements of intangible assets, goodwill and deferred income tax balances are subject to change.     Purchase price adjustments are expected to be finalized by December 31, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

The goodwill arising from the purchase price allocation of the SPIG acquisition is believed to be a result of the synergies created from combining its operations with B W's, and the growth it can provide from its wide scope of engineered cooling and service offerings and customer base.     None     of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.    
  The intangible assets included above consist of the following (dollar amount in millions):   

  The acquisition of SPIG added   $7.1 million   of intangible asset amortization expense during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Amortization of intangible assets is not allocated to segment results. 
    
  Approximately   $0.8 million   and   $2.8 million   of acquisition and integration related costs of SPIG were recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated and combined statement of operations for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
    
  The following unaudited pro-forma financial information below represents our results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , twelve months ended   December 31, 2015   and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016   had the SPIG acquisition occurred on January 1, 2015. The unaudited pro-forma financial information below is not intended to represent or be indicative of our actual consolidated results had we completed the acquisition at January 1, 2015. This information should not be taken as representative of our future consolidated results of operations.

NOTE 7     SEGMENT REPORTING 
    
  Our operations are assessed based on   three   reportable segments, which changed beginning in the third quarter of 2016 with the purchase of SPIG as described in Note 5. Segment results for prior periods have been restated for comparative purposes. 

Power:   Focused on the supply of and aftermarket services for steam-generating, environmental, and auxiliary equipment for power generation and other industrial applications. 
                
    Renewable:   Focused on the supply of steam-generating systems, environmental and auxiliary equipment for the waste-to-energy and biomass power generation industries.  
                
    Industrial:   Focused on custom-engineered cooling, environmental, and other industrial equipment along with related aftermarket services.  
       
  An analysis of our operations by segment is as follows: 

NOTE 8     RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES AND SPIN-OFF TRANSACTION COSTS 
    
  2016 Restructuring activities 
    
  On June 28, 2016, we announced actions to restructure our power business in advance of significantly lower demand now projected for U.S. power generation from coal. The new organizational structure includes a redesigned work flow to provide an efficient, flexible organization that can adapt to the changing market conditions and volumes. The costs associated with the restructuring activities were   $1.4 million   and   $30.8 million   in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and were primarily related to employee severance of   $14.0 million   and non-cash impairment of the long-lived assets at B W s one coal power plant of   $14.7 million  . Other costs associated with the restructuring of   $2.1 million   are related to organizational realignment of personnel and processes. The 2016 restructuring activities are expected to allow our business to continue to serve the power market and maintain gross margins, despite the expected decline in volume as a result of the lower projected demand in the US coal-fired power generation market. These restructuring actions are primarily in the Power segment. We also recognized changes in valuation allowances associated with our deferred tax assets as a result of the impact of these restructuring activities (see   Note 9  ). We expect additional restructuring charges of up to   $19 million   primarily related to additional manufacturing facility consolidation initiatives that could extend through 2017. 

13 

     Table of Contents  

Pre-2016 Restructuring activities 
    
  Previously announced restructuring initiatives intended to better position us for growth and profitability have primarily been related to facility consolidation and organizational efficiency initiatives. Theses costs were   $0.6 million   and   $1.0 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and   $3.8 million   and   $8.7 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. We expect additional restructuring charges of up to   $7.5 million   primarily related to facility demolition and consolidation activities, which will largely be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. The full benefits of the pre-2016 restructuring activities may not be fully achieved based on the lower demand now projected in the coal-fired power generation market.  
    
  Restructuring liabilities 
    
  Restructuring liabilities are included in other accrued liabilities on our condensed consolidated and combined balance sheets. Activity related to the restructuring liabilities is as follows: 

(2)   
    Excludes charges for long-lived asset impairment of   $0.2 million   and   $14.8 million   for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. Accelerated depreciation and long-lived asset impairment charges of   $6.3 million   were excluded from the   nine months ended   September 30, 2015. These non-cash charges did not impact the restructuring liability. 
       
  At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the remaining restructuring liabilities relate to employee termination benefits. 
    
  Spin-off transaction costs 
    
  In the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $0.4 million   and   $3.4 million  , respectively, of costs directly related to the spin-off from our former Parent. The costs were primarily attributable to employee retention awards.  
    
  In the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we incurred   $1.6 million   and   $2.5 million   of costs directly related to the spin-off from our former Parent.  The costs were primarily attributable to stock-based compensation and employee retention awards.  

NOTE 9     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 
    
  Our effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   15.2%   as compared to   22.0%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was lower than our statutory rate primarily due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of our forecasted full year income and losses and favorable impacts from adjustments related to prior years  tax returns in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   was lower than our statutory rate primarily due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of our income as well as adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain disputed items, offset by additional tax withholdings on a distribution from one of our foreign joint ventures. 
    
  Our effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   was approximately   1.8%   as compared to   27.8%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   was lower than our statutory rate due to a   $13.1 million   increase in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets related to our equity investment in a foreign joint venture and state net operating losses, which were recorded in connection with our restructuring activities announced June 28, 2016. Our effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30,     2015   was lower than our  
  
   14 

     Table of Contents  

statutory rate primarily due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of income as well as the favorable impact of an increase in benefits for amended federal manufacturing deductions and certain amended state return filings, offset by an increase to a valuation allowance against certain state deferred tax assets.

The hedged risk is the risk of changes in functional-currency-equivalent cash flows attributable to changes in FX spot rates of forecasted transactions related to long-term contracts. We exclude from our assessment of effectiveness the portion of the fair value of the FX forward contracts attributable to the difference between FX spot rates and FX forward rates. At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had deferred approximately   $3.4 million   and   $2.7 million  , respectively, of net gains (losses) on these derivative financial instruments in AOCI.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our derivative financial instruments consisted solely of FX forward contracts. The notional value of our FX forward contracts totaled   $161.4 million   and   $74.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, with maturities extending to November 2018. These instruments consist primarily of contracts to purchase or sell euros and British pounds sterling. We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments. We attempt to mitigate this risk by using major financial institutions with high credit ratings. The counterparties to all of our FX forward contracts are financial institutions party to our credit facility. Our hedge counterparties have the benefit of the same collateral arrangements and covenants as described under our credit facility.

NOTE 14     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, all of which were valued from readily available prices or using inputs based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets (known as "Level 1" and "Level 2" inputs, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Topic   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ).  

Available-for-sale securities 
    
  We estimate the fair value of available-for-sale securities based on quoted market prices. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are presented in other assets on our condensed consolidated and combined balance sheets.  
    
  Derivatives 
    
  Derivative assets and liabilities currently consist of FX forward contracts. Where applicable, the value of these derivative assets and liabilities is computed by discounting the projected future cash flow amounts to present value using market-based observable inputs, including FX forward and spot rates, interest rates and counterparty performance risk adjustments. 
    
  Other financial instruments 
    
  We used the following methods and assumptions in estimating our fair value disclosures for our other financial instruments: 
             
    Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents  . The carrying amounts that we have reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated and combined balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to their highly liquid nature. 
                
    Revolving debt  . We base the fair values of debt instruments on quoted market prices. Where quoted prices are not available, we base the fair values on the present value of future cash flows discounted at estimated borrowing rates for similar debt instruments or on estimated prices based on current yields for debt issues of similar quality and terms. The fair value of our debt instruments approximated their carrying value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
       
  Non-recurring fair value measurements 
    
  The purchase price allocation associated with the July 1, 2016 SPIG acquisition required significant fair value measurements using unobservable inputs ("Level 3" inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy established by FASB Topic   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ). The preliminary fair value of the acquired intangible assets was determined using the income approach (see   Note 5  ).

NOTE 15     WARRANTY EXPENSE 
    
  We accrue in cost of operations on our condensed consolidated and combined statements of operations estimated expenses to satisfy contractual warranty requirements when we recognize the associated revenues on the related contracts. In addition, we record specific provisions or reductions where we expect the actual warranty costs to differ from the accrued estimates. Such adjustments could have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  The following summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of our accrued warranty expense:    

Additions to accrued warranty expense during the third quarter of 2016 included   $0.9 million   from the acquisition of SPIG. 

NOTE 16     PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS 
    
  Components of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) included in net income (loss) are as follows: 

During the second and third quarters of 2016, we recorded adjustments to our benefit plan liabilities resulting from certain curtailment and settlement events. In September 2016, lump sum payments from our Canadian pension plan resulted in a   $0.1 million   pension plan settlement charge. In May 2016, the closure of our West Point, MS manufacturing facility resulted in a   $1.8 million   curtailment charge in our United States pension plan. In April 2016, lump sum payments from our Canadian pension plan resulted in a   $1.1 million   plan settlement charge.  
    
  These events described above also resulted in interim mark to market accounting for the respective benefit plans. Mark to market charges in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $0.5 million   in our Canadian pension plan. Mark to market charges for our US and Canadian pension plans were   $27.5 million   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . The pension mark to market charges were impacted by higher than expected returns on pension plan assets. The weighted-average discount rate used to remeasure the benefit plan liabilities at September 30, 2016 was   3.88%  . The effects of the pension plan charges and the mark to market losses are reflected in "Recognized net actuarial loss" in the table above.  
    
  As discussed in   Note 7  , we have excluded the recognized net actuarial loss from our reportable segments and such amount has been reflected in   Note 7   as the mark to market adjustment in the reconciliation of reportable segment income (loss) to consolidated operating income (loss). The recognized net actuarial loss and the affected condensed consolidated and combined statements of operations line items are as follows:

     Table of Contents  

We made contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaling   $1.8 million   and   $4.4 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $0.2 million   and   $6.7 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

NOTE 17     REVOLVING DEBT 
    
  The components of our revolving debt are comprised of separate revolving credit facilities in the following locations: 

United States credit facility  
    
  In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a credit agreement on May 11, 2015 (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to $600 million, which is scheduled to mature on June 30, 2020. The proceeds of loans under the Credit Agreement are available for working capital needs, issuance of letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $34.1 million   in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at an effective interest rate of   3.875%  . After giving effect to the leverage ratio and   $91.2 million   of letters of credit issued under the credit facility, we had approximately   $203.8 million   available for borrowings based on trailing-twelve-months EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Agreement, which includes the results of SPIG for the trailing-twelve-month period ending   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The Credit Agreement generally includes customary events of default for a secured credit facility. If an event of default relating to bankruptcy or other insolvency events with respect to us occurs under the Credit Agreement, all obligations will immediately become due and payable. If any other event of default exists, the lenders will be permitted to accelerate the maturity of the obligations outstanding. If any event of default occurs, the lenders are permitted to terminate their commitments thereunder and exercise other rights and remedies, including the commencement of foreclosure or other actions against the collateral. Additionally, if we are unable to make any of the representations and warranties in the Credit Agreement, we will be unable to borrow funds or have letters of credit issued. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of the covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement. 
    
  Foreign revolving credit facilities 
    
  Outside of the United States, we have revolving credit facilities in Turkey, China and India that are used to provide working capital to our operations in each country. The revolving credit facilities in Turkey and India are a result of the July 1, 2016 acquisition of SPIG (see Note 5). These three foreign revolving credit facilities allow us to borrow up to   $12.8 million   in aggregate and each have a one year term. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $10.6 million   in borrowings outstanding under these foreign revolving credit facilities at an effective weighted-average interest rate of   5.485%  . If an event of default relating to bankruptcy or insolvency events was to occur, all obligations will become due and payable. Additionally, the foreign revolving credit facilities are subordinate to the United States credit facility. 
    
  Letters of credit and bank guarantees  
    
  We can issue letters of credit under the United States credit facility. The aggregate value of all letters of credit issued under the United States credit facility as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $91.2 million   and   $109.6 million  , respectively. 
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

Certain subsidiaries have credit arrangements with various commercial banks and other financial institutions for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees in associated with contracting activity. The aggregate value of all such letters of credit and bank guarantees not secured by the United States credit facility as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $248.4 million   and   $193.1 million  , respectively. The increase is attributable to the July 1, 2016 acquisition of SPIG.  

NOTE 18     CONTINGENCIES 
    
  On February 28, 2014, the Arkansas River Power Authority ("ARPA") filed suit against Babcock   Wilcox Power Generation Group, Inc. (now known as The Babcock   Wilcox Company and referred to herein as  BW PGG ) in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado (Case No. 14-cv-00638-CMA-NYW) alleging breach of contract, negligence, fraud and other claims arising out of BW PGG's delivery of a circulating fluidized bed boiler and related equipment used in the Lamar Repowering Project pursuant to a 2005 contract. We believe that ARPA has asserted damages theories that are highly speculative and without legal or economic support as a litigation tactic. We also believe most of the alleged damages are expressly waived and/or capped in enforceable provisions of the 2005 contract. We cannot estimate the possible loss at this time; however, the 2005 contract provides an overall cap of liability at the original contract price of approximately   $20.5 million  . Discovery is complete and there have been no substantive changes to our assessment of the outcome of this contingency during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . A trial date has been set for November 7, 2016. 

NOTE 19     SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we paid the following for income taxes:  

During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized the following non-cash activity in our condensed consolidated and combined financial statements:  

NOTE 20     RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  Prior to June 30, 2015, we were a party to transactions with our former Parent and its subsidiaries in the normal course of operations. After the spin-off, we no longer consider the former Parent to be a related party. Transactions with our former Parent prior to the spin-off included the following:  

Guarantees 
    
  Our former Parent had outstanding performance guarantees for various projects executed by us in the normal course of business. As of April 21, 2016, these guarantees had all been terminated.

     Table of Contents  

Net transfers from former Parent 
    
  Net transfers from former Parent represent the change in our former Parent's historical investment in us. It primarily includes the net effect of cost allocations from transactions with our former Parent, sales to our former Parent, and the net transfers of cash and assets to our former Parent prior to the spin-off. After the spin-off transaction on June 30, 2015, there have been no significant transfers to or from our former Parent. These transactions included the following:  

NOTE 21     DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
    
  We distributed assets and liabilities totaling   $47.8 million   associated with the NE segment to BWC in conjunction with the spin-off. We received corporate allocations from our former Parent of   $2.7 million   through June 30, 2015, the date of our spin-off from our former Parent. Though these allocations relate to our discontinued NE segment, they are included as part of continuing operations because allocations are not eligible for inclusion in discontinued operations. 
    
  The following table presents selected financial information regarding the results of operations of our former NE segment through June 30, 2015, the date it was discontinued: 

NOTE 22     NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
    
  New accounting standards that could affect the Company's financial statements in the future are summarized as follows: 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-1, Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The new accounting standard is effective for the Company beginning in 2018, but early adoption is permitted. The new accounting standard requires investments such as available-for-sale securities to be measured at fair value through earnings each reporting period as opposed to changes in fair value being reported in other comprehensive income. We do not expect the new accounting standard to have a significant impact on the Company s financial results when adopted.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). With adoption of this standard, lessees will have to recognize almost all leases as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on their balance sheet. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. The new accounting standard is effective for the Company beginning in 2019. We do not expect the new accounting standard to have a significant impact on the Company s financial results when adopted.  

23 

     Table of Contents  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). The FASB amended its new revenue recognition guidance on determining whether an entity is a principal or an agent in an arrangement (i.e., whether it should report revenue gross or net).  In addition, the FASB voted to propose eight technical corrections related to the revenue standard, the majority of which involve consequential amendments to other accounting topics affected by the revenue standard.  In addition to ASU 2016-08, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):  Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting. This update finalized the guidance in the new revenue standards regarding collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition for customer contracts. The new accounting standards associated with revenue recognition are effective for the Company beginning in 2018. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The new standard identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. The new accounting standard is effective for the Company beginning in 2017. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on the Company's financial statements.

OVERVIEW OF RESULTS 
    
  In this report, unless the context otherwise indicates, "B W," "we," "us," "our" and "the Company" mean Babcock   Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
    
  Our assessment of operating results is based on   three   reportable segments, which changed in the third quarter of 2016. Our reportable segments are as follows: 

Power:   Focused on the supply of and aftermarket services for steam-generating, environmental, and auxiliary equipment for power generation and other industrial applications. 
                
    Renewable:   Focused on the supply of steam-generating systems, environmental and auxiliary equipment for the waste-to-energy and biomass power generation industries.  
                
    Industrial:   Focused on custom-engineered cooling, environmental, and other industrial equipment along with related aftermarket services.  
       
  In the third quarter of 2016, our consolidated revenue was slightly lower than the third quarter of 2015, while gross profit in each of our segments and our overall operating income improved compared to the year-ago period.  
    
  The third quarter 2016 Power segment revenue reflects the anticipated decline in the coal generation market. The restructuring actions we took on June 28, 2016 largely offset the effect of lower revenues, allowing us to maintain the segment's gross margin. 
  
   24 

     Table of Contents  

The third quarter 2016 operating results of our Renewable segment benefited from an increase in the level of activity on our renewable energy contracts, resulting in a record level of revenue for the segment. Gross profit was impacted by an additional   $14.0 million   loss from a change in estimate of the forecasted cost to complete a renewable energy contract in Europe related to a design deficiency that required re-engineering, on-site rework and delayed delivery, which was offset by a DKK   100 million   (  $15.0 million  ) receivable that represents a probable insurance recovery of a portion of the losses on this contract. The losses in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   total   $45.7 million   for this contract, but had a greater effect on our operating cash flow due to delays in meeting billing milestones. The project is approximately   79%   complete as of   September 30, 2016  . We expect B W's construction on the project will be completed in early 2017, with remaining commissioning and turnover activities linked to the customer's operation of the facilities through mid-2017.  
    
  The third quarter 2016 operating results of our Industrial segment were impacted by lower activity in the US market, which primarily impacted our MEGTEC business where we have seen customers delaying investment in their manufacturing facilities. Offsetting the headwinds in the US market, the MEGTEC business has seen strength in international markets. Despite the US market pressure, our MEGTEC division was able to keep third quarter revenue flat when compared to the same quarter in 2015. Gross profit in the MEGTEC division declined $3.0 million primarily due to the change in mix of projects and products. Growth in the industrial segment was driven by the July 1, 2016 acquisition of SPIG S.p.A. ("SPIG"), an Arona, Italy-based global provider of custom-engineered cooling systems and services, for  152.4 million (or approximately $169 million) in an all-cash transaction, net of working capital adjustments. SPIG provides comprehensive dry and wet cooling solutions and aftermarket services to the power generation industry including natural gas-fired and renewable energy power plants, as well as downstream oil and gas, petrochemical and other industrial end markets. The acquisition of SPIG is consistent with B W's goal to grow and diversify its technology-based offerings with new products and services that are complementary to our core businesses in the industrial markets. In the third quarter of 2016, SPIG contributed   $38.3 million   of revenue and   $4.2 million   of gross profit to the Industrial segment. Intangible asset amortization expense in the third quarter from the SPIG acquisition was   $7.1 million  . We expect amortization of the SPIG intangible assets to result in approximately   $6.3 million   and   $9.4 million   of expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 and full-year 2017, respectively. Intangible amortization is not allocated to the segment results. 
    
  Year-over-year comparisons of our results were also affected by: 
             
    $1.4 million   and   $30.8 million   of restructuring costs were recognized in the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, related to a restructuring plan announced on June 28, 2016. These actions restructured our business that serves the power generation market in advance of lower demand now projected for U.S. power generation from coal. This restructuring reduced the size of our organization that supports the coal market by approximately 20% and reorganized how we support the power market. The new organizational structure includes a redesigned work flow to provide an efficient, flexible organization that can adapt to the changing market conditions and volumes.  
                
    $0.6 million   and   $30.5 million   of actuarially determined mark to market pension losses in the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, were triggered by the closure of our West Point, MS manufacturing facility in May 2016 that resulted in a curtailment in our United States pension plan and lump sum payments from our Canadian pension plan in April and August 2016 that resulted in plan settlements.  
                
    $0.6 million   and   $3.8 million   of restructuring costs related to pre-2016 initiatives in the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $1.0 million   and   $8.7 million   in the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. These previously announced restructuring initiatives were intended to better position us for growth and profitability through facility consolidation and organizational efficiency initiatives. 
                
    $0.4 million   and   $3.4 million   of costs directly related to the spin-off from our former Parent were incurred in the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $1.6 million   and   $2.5 million   in the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The costs were primarily attributable to employee retention awards and other spin-related costs. Approximately $1.8 million of these costs is remaining, of which $1.1 million is expected to be recognized during 2017 and $0.3 million in 2018. 
                
    $0.8 million   and   $2.8 million   of acquisition and integration costs related to SPIG in the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, were included in selling, general and administrative expense. 
                
    $9.6 million of costs in the third quarter of 2015 were incurred related to a legal settlement, of which $7.8 million was reflected as a revenue reversal in the Power segment from the release of an accrued claims receivable, net of other remaining contract liabilities, and $1.8 million of legal costs was included in selling, general and administrative expense. 
     
   25 

     Table of Contents  

$9.0 million of impairment charges in the second quarter of 2015 were primarily related to research and development facilities and equipment dedicated to a carbon capture process that was determined not to be commercially viable. 
                
    $2.7 million of pre-spin allocations from our former Parent were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the six months ended June 30, 2015 related to the discontinued Nuclear Energy segment because allocations are not eligible for inclusion in the results of discontinued operations. The Nuclear Energy segment was distributed to the former Parent in the June 30, 2015 spin-off transaction. 
       
  Our third quarter and year to date segment and other operating results are described in more detail below. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
  THREE AND NINE   MONTHS ENDED   SEPTEMBER 30,     2016   VS.   2015    
    
  Selected financial highlights are presented in the table below: 

Consolidated and combined results of operations 
    
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   vs.   2015    
    
  Revenues decreased by   2.1%  , or   $9.0 million  , to   $411.0 million   in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $420.0 million   for the corresponding quarter in   2015   due primarily to a $84.4 million decrease in the volume of new projects, retrofits and aftermarket product sales in the Power segment, offset by a $37.4 million increase in the revenue recognized from ongoing performance on contracts in our Renewable segment. The acquisition of SPIG on July 1, 2016 added $38.3 million of revenue to our Industrial segment.  
    
  Gross profit, excluding intangible asset amortization expense and mark to market adjustments, increased by   4.7%  , or   $3.7 million  , to   $82.1 million   in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $78.4 million   for the corresponding quarter in   2015  . The primary drivers of the increase are the benefits from the Power segment's 2016 second quarter restructuring and  
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

the acquisition of SPIG, which contributed $4.2 million of gross profit to the Industrial segment during the quarter. The intangible asset amortization expense and mark to market adjustments are discussed in further detail in the sections below.  
    
  Equity in income (loss) of investees during the   third   quarter of 2016 increased   $1.8 million   to a gain of   $2.8 million   compared to income of   $1.0 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015. The increase in equity income of investees during the   third   quarter of 2016 is attributable to the performance of our joint venture in India. 
    
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   vs.   2015    
    
  Revenues decreased by   4.5%  , or   $56.3 million  , to   $1.20 billion   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $1.25 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  , due primarily to a $148.8 million net decrease in the volume of new projects, retrofits and aftermarket product sales in the Power segment, offset by a $68.5 million increase in the revenue recognized primarily related to our performance on ongoing contracts in our Renewable segment. The acquisition of SPIG on July 1, 2016 added   $38.3 million   of revenue to our Industrial segment, which was offset by a $14.4 million decrease in revenue from MEGTEC.  
    
  Gross profit, excluding intangible asset amortization expense and mark to market adjustments, decreased by   13.0%  , or   $31.5 million  , to   $218.9 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $250.4 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The primary driver of the decrease is the   $45.7 million   charge related to changes in estimates on a European Renewable segment contract. Offsetting these contract losses in the third quarter of 2016, we have recorded a DKK 100 million (  $15.0 million  ) receivable as a probable insurance recovery of these losses, representing the full amount available under the insurance policy. The Power segment experienced a   $5.4 million   net decrease in gross profit related primarily to the decrease in profitability from the lower volume of sales of aftermarket products. The Industrial segment benefited from the acquisition of SPIG, which contributed   $4.2 million   of gross profit during the quarter, which partially offset the $8.2 million decline in the gross profit from MEGTEC.  
    
  Intangible asset amortization expense and mark to market adjustments are discussed in further detail in the sections below.  
    
  Equity in income of investees during the first   nine   months of 2016 increased   $4.9 million   as compared to the   $0.1 million   loss in the corresponding period in 2015. The increase in equity income of investees is attributable primarily to the project performance and lower overhead costs of our joint venture in India. 
    
  The performance drivers of each segment as well as other operating costs are discussed in more detail below. 

Power    

Three months ended   September 30, 2016   vs.   2015    
    
  Revenues decreased   28.7%  , or   $84.4 million  , to   $209.8 million   in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $294.2 million   in the corresponding quarter in   2015  . The revenue decrease in the segment is primarily attributable to the anticipated decline in aftermarket parts and service projects. The revenue decrease was also attributable to a $20.4 million decrease in revenue from our Canadian oil sands contract, which was delayed past 2016 due to wildfires in the region earlier this year. In the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we reversed $7.8 million of revenue associated with an accrued claims receivable as part of a legal settlement of the Berlin Station contract.

     Table of Contents  

Gross profit increased   2.7%  , or   $1.3 million  , to   $48.9 million   in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to gross profit of   $47.6 million   in the corresponding quarter in   2015  . We were able to maintain or improve our gross margins as a result of the 2016 restructuring actions, which partially offset the gross profit effect of lower volume and the mix of aftermarket parts and service projects. Comparisons were also affected by events in the prior year period. In the quarter ended September 30, 2015, gross profit was negatively impacted by the $7.8 million loss associated with the Berlin Station contract that was settled during the quarter and an $8.4 million contract loss accrual based on an updated forecast to complete a large construction services contract that had unfavorable labor productivity and other cost adjustments during the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   vs.   2015    
    
  Revenues decreased   16.6%  , or   $150.5 million  , to   $757.4 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $907.9 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The revenue decrease was attributable to the decline in environmental projects, aftermarket parts and service projects. The revenue decrease was also attributable to a $31.4 million decrease in revenue from our Canadian oil sands contract, which were delayed past 2016 due to wildfires in the region earlier this year. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we reversed $7.8 million of revenue associated with an accrued claims receivable as part of a legal settlement of the Berlin Station contract.  
    
  Gross profit decreased   3.0%  , or   $5.4 million  , to   $170.9 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $176.3 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily related to the lower gross profit from the mix of service projects and lower parts volumes during the first   nine   months of 2016, offset by project close-outs of construction services. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, gross profit was negatively impacted by the $7.8 million loss associated with the Berlin Station contract that was settled during the third quarter of 2015 and an $8.4 million contract loss accrual based on an updated forecast to complete a large construction services project that had unfavorable labor productivity and other cost adjustments during the third quarter of 2015. 

Renewable 

Three months ended   September 30, 2016   vs.   2015    
    
  Revenues increased   43.1%  , or   $37.4 million  , to   $124.3 million   in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $86.9 million   in the corresponding quarter in   2015  . The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in level of activity on our renewable energy contracts. 
    
  Gross profit increased   6.5%  , or   $1.1 million  , to   $18.6 million   in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $17.5 million   in the corresponding quarter in   2015  . The primary driver of the increase in gross profit was higher revenue during the third quarter of 2016. The third quarter of 2016 also includes a change in estimate of the forecasted cost to complete one renewable energy contract in Europe that increased the expected loss by   $14.0 million   and a DKK   100 million   (  $15.0 million  ) reduction in costs related to the probable insurance recovery of a portion of the losses on this contract.   
    
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   vs.   2015    
    
  Revenues increased   31.4%  , or   $70.2 million  , to   $293.6 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $223.4 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase in revenues is attributable primarily to a $65.1 million increase in the level of activity on our renewable energy contracts.   
    
  Gross profit decreased   60.4%  , or   $22.1 million  , to   $14.5 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $36.6 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The primary driver of the decrease in gross profit was the   $45.7 million   charge related to changes in estimates of the forecasted cost to complete one renewable energy contract in Europe, offset by a  
  
   28 

     Table of Contents  

DKK   100 million   (  $15.0 million  ) reduction in costs related to the probable insurance recovery of a portion of the losses on that contract. Offsetting the decline in the segment's gross profit was a $5.9 million increase in gross profit on other renewable energy contracts due to higher revenue during the 2016 period. 

Industrial 

Three months ended   September 30, 2016   vs.   2015    
    
  Revenues increased   97.5%  , or   $37.9 million  , to   $76.8 million   in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $38.9 million   in the corresponding quarter in   2015  . While revenue from the MEGTEC business was flat for the third quarter of 2016, the acquisition of SPIG on July 1, 2016 contributed   $38.3 million   of revenue to the segment. 
    
  Gross profit increased   9.1%  , or   $1.2 million  , to   $14.6 million   in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $13.4 million   in the corresponding quarter in   2015  . MEGTEC had a decrease in gross profit of   $3.0 million   during the   third   quarter of 2016 primarily due to the mix of revenue and a $1.3 million charge for a contingent liability. SPIG contributed   $4.2 million   of gross profit to the segment during the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   vs.   2015    
    
  Revenues increased   19.4%  , or   $23.9 million  , to   $147.3 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $123.4 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . Revenues increased primarily due to the July 1, 2016 acquisition of SPIG, which contributed   $38.3 million   of revenue to the segment. MEGTEC has a   $14.4 million   decline in revenue attributable to a decline in sales volumes of environmental solutions and engineered equipment. The overall decrease in the revenue from MEGTEC is attributable to a decline in demand in the industrials market in the Americas during the first   nine   months of 2016.  
    
  Gross profit from MEGTEC decreased   21.9%  , or   $8.2 million  , to   $29.3 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $37.5 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  , which was attributable to a decline in environmental solutions gross margins, a decline in engineered products volume and a $1.3 million charge for a contingent liability. SPIG contributed   $4.2 million   of gross profit to the segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Bookings and backlog 
    
  Bookings and backlog are not measures recognized by generally accepted accounting principles. It is possible that our methodology for determining bookings and backlog may not be comparable to methods used by other companies.  
    
  We generally include expected revenue from contracts in our backlog when we receive written confirmation from our customers authorizing the performance of work and committing the customers to payment for work performed. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results and contracts in our backlog may be canceled, modified or otherwise altered by customers. We do not include orders of our unconsolidated joint ventures in backlog.  
    
  Bookings represent additions to our backlog. We believe comparing bookings on a quarterly basis or for periods less than one year is less meaningful than for longer periods, and that shorter term changes in bookings may not necessarily indicate a material trend.

     Table of Contents  

Of the backlog at   September 30, 2016  , we expect to recognize revenues as follows: 

Research and development expenses 
    
  Research and development expenses relate to the development and improvement of new and existing products and equipment, as well as conceptual and engineering evaluation for translation into practical applications. These expenses were   $2.4 million   and   $4.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $8.3 million   and   $12.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease in research and development expenses was a result of our decision to reduce the level of spending in-line with the lower demand in the coal power generation market compared to the same periods in 2015. The third quarter and first nine months of 2016 also benefited from   $0.5 million   and   $1.5 million   less depreciation expense, respectively, resulting from the impairment of research and development equipment and facilities during 2015.  

Selling, general and administrative expenses 
    
  Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses decreased by   $2.0 million   to   $60.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $62.6 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  , primarily due to savings from our 2016 restructuring actions and reduced incentive compensation accruals, partially offset by the addition of SPIG. SG A expenses increased by   $4.2 million   to   $182.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $178.5 million   for the corresponding period in   2015   primarily due to savings from our 2016 restructuring actions and reduced incentive compensation accruals, partially offset by the addition of SPIG and additional stand-alone costs. Additional stand-alone costs were for administrative functions that were shared with the former Parent before the June 30, 2015 spin-off. The stand-alone costs to operate our business as an independent public entity exceeded the historical allocations of expenses from BWC to us related to areas that include, but are not limited to, litigation and other legal matters, compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other corporate governance matters, insurance and claims management. In addition, approximately   $0.8 million   and   $2.8 million   of acquisition and integration related costs related to the SPIG acquisition and integration effort were recorded as SG A expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  
    
  Also, as discussed in   Note 1   to the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements, we distributed assets and liabilities totaling   $47.8 million   associated with our former NE segment to BWC in conjunction with the spin-off on June 30, 2015. We received corporate allocations from our former Parent of   $2.7 million   through June 30, 2015, the date of our spin-off from our former Parent. Though these allocations relate to our discontinued NE segment, they are included as part of SG A expenses in the results from our continuing operations for the first half of 2015 because allocations are not eligible for inclusion in discontinued operations.

Restructuring 
    
  2016 Restructuring activities 
    
  On June 28, 2016, we announced actions to restructure our power business in advance of lower demand now projected for U.S. power generation from coal. The new organizational structure includes a redesigned work flow to provide an efficient, flexible organization that can adapt to the changing market conditions and volumes. The costs associated with the restructuring activities were   $1.4 million   and   $30.8 million   in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and were primarily related to employee severance which totaled   $14.0 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Restructuring costs in the second quarter of 2016 included non-cash impairment of the long-lived assets at B W s one coal power plant of   $14.7 million  . Other costs associated with the restructuring of   $2.1 million   are related to organizational realignment of personnel and processes. Also related to these restructuring activities, we recorded non-cash income tax expense of   $13.1 million   related to increasing valuation allowances on deferred tax assets associated with our equity investment in a foreign joint venture and certain state net operating loss carryforwards. The 2016 restructuring activities are expected to allow our business to continue to serve the power market and maintain gross margins, despite the expected decline in volume as a result of the now lower projected demand in the US coal-fired power generation market. These restructuring actions are primarily in the Power segment. We expect additional restructuring charges of up to   $19 million   primarily related to additional manufacturing facility consolidation initiatives that could extend through 2017. 
    
  Pre-2016 restructuring activities 
    
  Previously announced restructuring initiatives intended to better position us for growth and profitability have primarily been related to facility consolidation and organizational efficiency initiatives. Theses costs were   $0.6 million   and   $1.0 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $3.8 million   and   $8.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We expect additional restructuring charges of up to   $7.5 million   primarily related to facility demolition and consolidation activities, which will largely be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. The full benefits of the pre-2016 restructuring activities may not be fully achieved based on the lower demand now projected in the coal-fired power generation market.  
    
  Spin-off transaction costs 
    
  Costs directly related to the spin-off from our former Parent totaled   $0.4 million   and   $3.4 million   in the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $1.6 million   and   $2.5 million   in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The costs were primarily attributable to employee retention awards. Approximately $1.8 million of these costs is remaining, of which $1.1 million is expected to be recognized during 2017 and $0.3 million in 2018. 
  Costs associated with the spin-off that were incurred during the first half of 2015 were borne by our former Parent. 

Intangible asset amortization expense 
    
  Amortization of our intangible assets was recorded in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses as follows: 

The acquisition of SPIG on July 1, 2016 resulted in a   $7.1 million   increase in amortization expense recorded in cost of sales during the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The third quarter of 2016 amortization expense is not representative of future expected amortization of our intangible assets, as described in Note 6 in our condensed consolidated and combined financial statements. Amortization of intangible assets is not allocated to segment results. 
    
  The amortization of the intangible assets associated with the June 20, 2014 acquisition of MEGTEC resulted in   $0.2 million   of amortization expense recorded in cost of sales during both the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, and   $0.5 million   and   $5.8

million   of amortization expense recorded in cost of sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, amortization expense of $0.9 million was recorded in SG A during both the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, and $2.6 million and $2.3 million of amortization expense recorded in SG A during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Mark to market adjustments for pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
    
  During the second and third quarter of 2016, we recorded adjustments to our benefit plan liabilities resulting from certain curtailment and settlements events. In September 2016, lump sum payments from our Canadian pension plan resulted in   $0.1 million   pension plan settlement charge. In May 2016, the closure of our West Point, MS manufacturing facility resulted in a   $1.8 million   curtailment charge in our United States pension plan. In April 2016, lump sum payments from our Canadian pension plan resulted in a   $1.1 million   settlement charge. These events also resulted in interim mark to market accounting for the respective benefit plans. Mark to market adjustments in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $0.5 million   in our Canadian pension plan. Mark to market charges for our US and Canadian pension plans were   $27.5 million   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . The weighted-average discount rate used to remeasure the benefit plan liabilities at September 30, 2016 was   3.88%  . The mark to market charges were also impacted by higher than expected returns on pension plan assets. The effects of these charges and mark to market adjustments on our cost of operations and SG A are detailed in   Note 16   to the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements.  

Provision for income taxes 

We operate in numerous countries that have statutory tax rates below that of the United States federal statutory rate of   35%  . The most significant of these foreign operations are located in Denmark, Canada, Sweden, Mexico, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom with effective tax rates ranging between 20% and approximately 30%. Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes generated in the United States and foreign locations for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented in the table below.  

Our effective tax rate for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   15.2%   as compared to   22.0%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . Our effective tax rate for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was lower than our statutory rate primarily due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of our forecasted full year income and losses and favorable impacts from adjustments related to prior years  tax returns in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   was lower than our statutory rate primarily due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of our income as well as adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain disputed items, offset by additional tax withholdings on a distribution from one of our foreign joint ventures. 
    
  Our effective tax rate for the   nine months ended      September 30, 2016   was approximately   1.8%   as compared to   27.8%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Our effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016    was lower than our statutory rate primarily due to a $13.1 million increase in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets related to our equity investment in a foreign joint venture and state net operating losses, and to the jurisdictional mix of our forecasted full year income and losses, as described above. Our effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was lower than our statutory rate primarily due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of our forecasted full year income as well as the  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents  

favorable impact of an increase in benefits for amended federal manufacturing deductions and certain amended state return filings, offset by an increase to a valuation allowance against certain state deferred tax assets. 

Liquidity and capital resources 
    
  Of our   $65.1 million   of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $64.1 million   is held by foreign entities. On July 1, 2016, we disbursed approximately   $172 million   to acquire SPIG (see   Note 5   to the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements). In general, the remaining foreign cash balances are not available to fund our United States operations unless the funds are repatriated to the United States, which would expose us to taxes we presently have not accrued in our results of operations. We presently have no plans to repatriate these funds to the United States as our United States liquidity is sufficient to meet the cash requirements of our United States operations.  
    
  We continue to explore growth strategies across our segments through acquisitions to expand and complement our existing businesses. We would expect to fund these opportunities by cash on hand, external financing (including debt), equity or some combination thereof. We expect cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and our borrowing capacity to be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least twelve months from the date of this filing. 
    
  Our net cash used in operations was   $39.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to cash provided by operations of   $93.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The change is primarily attributable to lower net income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The contract volume and timing of contract activities resulted in a   $24.6 million   increase in operating cash outflows from accounts payable during during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In addition, there was a   $4.9 million   net decrease in accounts receivable, contracts in progress and advanced billings compared to a   $25.3 million   increase in the same nine month period in 2015 primarily due to timing of billings and stage of completion of large, ongoing contracts in our Renewable segment.  
    
  Our net cash used in investing activities was   $191.6 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $25.0 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the   $143.0 million   acquisition of SPIG on July 1, 2016, net of cash acquired, and a   $26.2 million   contribution in April 2016 to increase our interest in Thermax Babcock   Wilcox Energy Solutions Private Limited ("TBWES ), our joint venture in India, for the purpose of extinguishing the joint venture's high-interest third-party debt and avoiding the associated future interest cost (our joint venture partner contributed the same amount to TBWES). TBWES subsequently used the cash contributed by the joint venture partners to pay-off all of its existing debt, including the long-term bank debt obtained in 2011 to finance the construction of the manufacturing facility TBWES operates in India and its working capital bank loan. Capital expenditures were   $20.4 million   and   $21.9 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
    
  Our net cash used in financing activities was   $64.6 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $79.1 million   provided by financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The cash provided by financing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was a result of   $33.2 million   net borrowings on our revolvers to fund our working capital needs, which was more than offset by our repayment of   $18.3 million   of SPIG's revolving debt during the third quarter of 2016 and our repurchase of   $75.7 million   of our common stock during the period pursuant to our share repurchase program. The net cash provided by financing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   reflects the net cash transferred from our former Parent during the period.  
    
  United States credit facility 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $34.1 million   of borrowings are outstanding under our U.S. revolving credit facility. After giving effect to the leverage ratio and   $91.2 million   of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, we had approximately   $203.8 million   available for borrowings or to meet letter of credit requirements primarily based on trailing-twelve-months EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Agreement. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of the covenants set forth in our United States revolving credit facility. 
    
  Foreign revolving credit facilities  
    
  Outside of the US, we have revolving credit facilities in Turkey, China and India that are used to provide working capital to our operations in each country. These three foreign revolving credit facilities allow us to borrow up to   $12.8 million   in

     Table of Contents  

aggregate and each have a one year term. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $10.6 million   in borrowings outstanding under these foreign revolving credit facilities at an effective weighted-average interest rate of   5.485%  .  
    
  Other credit arrangements 
    
  The Company can issue letters of credit under the US credit facility. The aggregate value of all letters of credit issued under the US credit facility as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $91.2 million   and   $109.6 million  , respectively. 
    
  Certain subsidiaries have credit arrangements with various commercial banks and other financial institutions for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees in associated with contracting activity. The aggregate value of all such letters of credit and bank guarantees not secured by the US credit facility as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $248.4 million   and   $193.1 million  , respectively. The increase is attributable to the July 1, 2016 acquisition of SPIG.  
    
  We have posted surety bonds to support contractual obligations to customers relating to certain projects. We utilize bonding facilities to support such obligations, but the issuance of bonds under those facilities is typically at the surety's discretion. Although there can be no assurance that we will maintain our surety bonding capacity, we believe our current capacity is more than adequate to support our existing project requirements for the next twelve months. In addition, these bonds generally indemnify customers should we fail to perform our obligations under the applicable contracts. We, and certain of our subsidiaries, have jointly executed general agreements of indemnity in favor of surety underwriters relating to surety bonds those underwriters issue in support of some of our contracting activity. As of   September 30, 2016  , bonds issued and outstanding under these arrangements in support of contracts totaled approximately   $555.7 million  . 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  For a summary of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements, see "Critical Accounting Policies" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes to our policies during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , except for the following concerning our accounting and disclosures associated with business combinations.  
    
  Business combinations    
    
  We account for acquisitions in accordance with FASB Topic   Business Combinations.   This topic requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and interests transferred as a result of business combinations. It also provides disclosure requirements to assist users of the financial statements in evaluating the nature and financial effects of business combinations. 
  We accounted for the acquisition of SPIG using the acquisition method. All of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their fair value on the July 1, 2016 acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs were recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements. 
    
  Several valuation methods were used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we used the income method, which required us to forecast the expected future net cash flows for each intangible asset. These cash flows were then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the projected cash flows. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset's economic life and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also required judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives, or indefinite useful lives. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  The acquisition of SPIG on July 1, 2016 adds additional exposure to the Euro and other currencies, but in the same manner as our existing business where costs and revenues may not be in the same currency and hedging instruments are used to reduce risks from currency fluctuations. Our hedging arrangements are more fully described in Note 13 to our condensed consolidated and combined financial statements in Item 1. Other than the acquisition of SPIG, our exposures to market risks

     Table of Contents  

have not changed materially from those disclosed under "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure controls and procedures 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")). Our disclosure controls and procedures were developed through a process in which our management applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the control objectives. You should note that the design of any system of disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon various assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.  
    
  On July 1, 2016, we acquired SPIG, and it represented approximately 19% of our total assets as of September 30, 2016. As the acquisition occurred during the last 12 months, the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures does not include internal controls over financial reporting related to SPIG. This exclusion is in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from our internal control over financial reporting scope in the year of acquisition.  
    
  Based on the evaluation referred to above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of   September 30, 2016   to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  
    
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  In August 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program. The following table provides information on our purchases of equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Any shares purchased that were not part of a publicly announced plan or program are related to repurchases of common stock pursuant to the provisions of employee benefit plans that permit the repurchase of shares to satisfy statutory tax withholding obligations.

    Includes 2,570, 1,619 and 1,390 shares repurchased during July, August and September 2016, respectively, pursuant to the provisions of employee benefit plans that permit the repurchase of shares to satisfy statutory tax withholding obligations. 
      (2) 
    On August 4, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase an indeterminate number of shares of our common stock at an aggregate market value of up to $100 million in the open market during the period ending June 8, 2017.  
      (3) 
    On August 4, 2016, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an indeterminate number of our shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate market value of up to $100 million over the next twenty-four months. As of November 2, 2016, we have not made any share repurchases under the August 4, 2016 share repurchase authorization. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
    
  We own, manage and operate Ebensburg Power Company, an independent power company that produces alternative electrical energy. Through one of our subsidiaries, Revloc Reclamation Service, Inc., Ebensburg Power Company operates multiple coal refuse sites in Western Pennsylvania (collectively, the "Revloc Sites"). At the Revloc Sites, Ebensburg Power Company utilizes coal refuse from abandoned surface mine lands to produce energy. Beyond converting the coal refuse to energy, Ebensburg Power Company is also taking steps to reclaim the former surface mine lands to make the land and streams more attractive for wildlife and human uses. 
    
  The Revloc Sites are subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and this Item is included in Exhibit 95 to this report.

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.1 

CHANGE IN CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT 
  This Change in Control Severance Agreement (   Agreement   ) is by and between Babcock   Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. (the    Company   ) and __________________     (   Executive   ). 
  WHEREAS  , (a) the Company considers it essential to the interests of the Company s stockholders to encourage the continued employment of key management personnel, (b) the Board of Directors of the Company recognizes that the possibility of a Change in Control (as defined in Exhibit A to this Agreement) exists and that the uncertainty this raises may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders, and (c) in order to encourage the continued attention and dedication of key management personnel, this Agreement is being entered into by the Company and Executive; 
  WHEREAS  , the Company and Executive previously entered into a Change in Control Agreement, dated June 30, 2015     (the    Original Agreement    
  WHEREAS  , the Company and Executive now wish to amend and restate the Original Agreement to rename it, to clarify the terms of the Original Agreement in order to reflect the original intent of the parties, and to provide Executive a new benefit described below; and  
  WHEREAS  , Executive acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is supported by good and valuable consideration in the form of continued employment by the Company, the Company s promises under this Agreement, and the new benefit described below.  
  NOW, THEREFORE  , in exchange for the premises and mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and other good and valid consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the Company and Executive agree as follows: 
           1. 
    DEFINITIONS  :  Capitalized terms are defined in Exhibit A to this Agreement. 
              2. 
    SEVERANCE BENEFITS  :  If Executive experiences a Covered Termination he or she will be entitled to the payments and benefits set forth below; provided that the benefits described in Sections 2(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) shall only be payable if Executive executes a waiver and release prepared by the Company, which releases the Company and its affiliates, directors, officers and other customary persons from any claim or liability arising out of or related to Executive s employment with or termination of employment from the Company or any of its affiliates (except for amounts to which Executive is legally entitled pursuant to employee benefit plans, Executive s right to enforce this Agreement and rights to insurance coverage or indemnification) (the    Release   ), which Release is not revoked within the time period provided therein, and the executed Release is delivered to the Company no later than forty-five (45) days after the Covered Termination. 
     
   1 

Exhibit 10.1 

(a) 
    Accrued Benefits  .  The Accrued Benefits, payable within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Covered Termination, or such earlier time as may be required by applicable law. 
              (b) 
    SERP  .  As of the effective date of the Covered Termination, a fully vested and non-forfeitable interest in Executive s account balance in the SERP and Restoration Plan (as applicable), payable in accordance with the terms of SERP and/or Restoration Plan, as applicable. 
              (c) 
    Unvested Equity Awards  .  As of the effective date of the Covered Termination, unless otherwise settled in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 of this Agreement and the plans and agreements referred to therein, a fully vested and non-forfeitable interest in any outstanding unvested equity awards granted on Company Shares (   Equity Awards   ), to be vested and, in the case of restricted stock units, settled, in any such case within the 60   th    day after the effective date of the Covered Termination; provided that no such Equity Award that is subject to Code Section 409A will be paid on a date earlier than is provided in the applicable Equity Award agreement to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of tax penalties pursuant to Code Section 409A; provided further that any performance-based Equity Awards shall be settled with respect to the number of Company Shares earned based on the target rate of performance applicable to such award.  In addition, any Equity Awards that are vested (including as a result of the foregoing provision) options to purchase Company Shares that Executive holds as of the date of his or her Covered Termination will remain exercisable through the expiration of the original term of such option. 
              (d) 
    Severance Payment Based on Salary  .  An amount equal to [____] times the sum of Executive s (x) Salary plus (y) the product of (1) Salary and (2) Target Bonus Percentage, paid in a lump sum in cash within sixty (60) days after the Covered Termination. 
              (e) 
    Severance Payment Based on Bonus  . 
              (1) 
    Covered Termination Performance Year  .  An amount equal to the product of (A) the Salary and (B) the Target Bonus Percentage, with the product of (A) and (B) prorated based on the number of days Executive was employed during the bonus year in which Executive s Covered Termination occurs, paid in a lump sum in cash within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Covered Termination. 
              (2) 
    Prior Performance Year  .  If a bonus for the prior calendar year has not been paid under the Bonus Plan as of Executive s effective date of the Covered  
     
   2 

Exhibit 10.1 

Termination, then Executive will be entitled to the actual amount of the bonus determined under the Bonus Plan for such prior calendar year (such amount to be determined without the exercise of any downward discretion), paid in a lump sum in cash at the same time such bonus is paid to other Bonus Plan participants. 
           (f) 
    Health Care Benefits  .  An amount equal to three (3) times the full annual cost that would be payable by Executive for continuation of coverage for medical, dental and vision benefits if elected by Executive for him/herself and his/her eligible dependents under COBRA for the year in which Executive s Covered Termination occurs, paid in a lump sum in cash within sixty (60) days after the Covered Termination.  For purposes of clarity, the payment contemplated by this Section 2(f) shall be paid to Executive irrespective of whether Executive elects COBRA and Executive shall not be obligated to use such amounts for payment of COBRA premiums (if so elected). 
     In no event shall the benefits provided for in Sections 2(a), (d), (e) and (f) above or any payment provided for in (c) above that is not subject to Code Section 409A be paid later than March 15th of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which     Executive s Covered Termination Date occurs.  For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a Covered Termination, in no event shall Executive be eligible for or entitled to any other severance payments or benefits under any other severance plan, program or policy maintained by the Company or any of its Affiliates. 
           3. 
    LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS  :  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any amount or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement would be an  Excess Parachute Payment,  within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, but for the application of this sentence, then the payments and benefits identified in the last sentence of this Section 3 to be paid or provided under this Agreement will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment; provided, however, that no such reduction shall be made if it is not thereby possible to eliminate all Excess Parachute Payments under this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing reduction will be made only if and to the extent that such reduction would result in an increase in the aggregate payment and benefits to he provided, determined on an after-tax basis (taking into account the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law, and any applicable federal, state and local income and employment taxes).  Whether requested by Executive or the Company, the determination of whether any reduction in such payments or benefits to be provided under this Agreement or otherwise is required pursuant to the preceding sentence will be made at the expense of  
     
   3 

Exhibit 10.1 

the Company by the Company s independent accountants, which determination shall take into account a reasonable compensation analysis of the value of services provided or to be provided by Executive, including Executive s agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a covenant not to compete or similar covenant applicable to Executive (including, without limitation, those contemplated by Sections 7, 8 and 9 of this Agreement). 
  The fact that Executive s right to payments or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this Section 3 will not of itself limit or otherwise affect any other rights of Executive other than pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided under this Agreement or otherwise is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section 3, the Company will reduce Executive s payment and/or benefits, to the extent required, in the following order: (i) the lump sum payment provided under Section 2(d); (ii) the lump sum payment provided under Section 2(e)(1); (iii) the lump sum payment related to Health Care Benefits provided under Section 2(f); and (iv) the accelerated vesting of equity-based awards described in Section 2(c). 
           4. 
    CHANGE IN CONTROL EQUITY-BASED BENEFITS  :  If a Change in Control occurs, any benefits Executive may be entitled to with respect to any equity-based compensation (including any Equity Awards) shall be determined in accordance with the applicable plans and award agreements.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any such plans or award agreement and Section 2(c) of this Agreement, the terms of such plan or award agreement shall control to the extent such plan or award agreement provides for accelerated vesting or settlement in connection with a Change in Control (either upon the occurrence of such an event or thereafter).  For the avoidance of doubt, if any given equity-based compensation award agreement is silent with respect to the effect of a Change in Control and the plan pursuant to which any such award agreement is granted does not contain provisions that would automatically apply to the given award, then Section 2(c) of this Agreement shall control. 
              1. 
    ADDITIONAL BENEFIT  : As consideration for Executive entering into this Agreement and the amendment and restatement of the Original Agreement, the Company shall make available to Executive at the Company s expense one (1) airline club membership in addition to that currently available to Executive beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the earlier of (i) the last day of Executive s employment with the Company, or (ii) five (5) years after the date of this Agreement.   
               (a) 
    Compliance  .  It is the intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement either comply with Code Section 409A and the Treasury regulations and guidance issued  
     
   4 

Exhibit 10.1 

thereunder or that one or more elements of compensation or benefits be exempt from Code Section 409A.  Accordingly, the parties intend that this Agreement be interpreted and operated in a manner consistent with such requirements in order to avoid the application of penalty taxes under Code Section 409A to the extent reasonably practicable.  The Company shall neither cause nor permit:  (i) any payment, benefit or consideration to be substituted for a benefit that is payable under this Agreement if such action would result in the failure of any amount that is subject to Code Section 409A to comply with the applicable requirements of Code Section 409A; or (ii) any adjustments to any equity interest to be made in a manner that would result in the equity interest s becoming subject to Code Section 409A unless, after such adjustment, the equity interest is in compliance with the requirements of Code Section 409A to the extent applicable.  A Covered Termination shall constitute an  involuntary separation from service  for purposes of Code Section 409A. 
           (b) 
    Waiting Period for Specified Employees  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if Executive is a  Specified Employee  (as that term is defined in Code Section 409A) as of Executive s Covered Termination Date, then any amounts or benefits which are payable under this Agreement upon Executive s  Separation from Service  (within the meaning of Code Section 409A), which are subject to the provisions of Code Section 409A and not otherwise exempt under Code Section 409A, and would otherwise be payable during the first six-month period following such Separation from Service, shall be paid on the first business day that (i) is at least six months after the date after Executive s Covered Termination Date or (ii) follows Executive s date of death, if earlier (the    Waiting Period   ).  The benefits in Sections 2(a), (d), (e) and (f) and certain of the benefits in Section 2(c) are intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A under the  short-term deferral exemption  and thus the Waiting Period is not intended to apply to such benefits. 
              3. 
    CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE  :  Executive acknowledges that pursuant to this Agreement, the Company agrees to provide to him or her Confidential Information and has previously provided him or her other such Confidential Information.  In return for this and other consideration, provided under this Agreement, Executive agrees that he/she will not, while employed by the Company or any Affiliate and thereafter, disclose or make available to any other person or entity, or use for his or her own personal gain, any Confidential Information, except for such disclosures as required in the performance of his or her duties hereunder as may otherwise be required by law or legal process (in which case Executive shall notify the Company of such legal or judicial proceeding as soon as practicable following his or her receipt of notice of such a proceeding, and permit the Company to seek to protect its interests and information). 
     
   5 

Exhibit 10.1 

4. 
    RETURN OF PROPERTY  :  Executive agrees that at the time of leaving his or her employ with the Company or an Affiliate, he/she will deliver to the Company (and will not keep in his or her possession, recreate or deliver to anyone else) all Confidential Information as well as all other devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, materials, equipment, customer or client lists or information, or any other documents or property (including all reproductions of the aforementioned items) belonging to the Company or any of its Affiliates, regardless of whether such items were prepared by Executive. 
              5. 
    NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-COMPETITION  : 
              (a) 
    For consideration provided under this Agreement, including, but not limited to the Company s agreement to provide Executive with Confidential Information regarding the Company and its respective businesses, Executive agrees that while employed by the Company or an Affiliate and for [___] months following a Separation from Service during the term of this Agreement he/she shall not, without the prior written consent of the General Counsel, directly or indirectly, (i) hire or induce, entice or solicit (or attempt to induce, entice or solicit) any employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates or ventures to leave the employment of the Company or any of its Affiliates or ventures or (ii) solicit or attempt to solicit the business of any customer or acquisition prospect of the Company or any of its Affiliates or ventures with whom Executive had any actual contact or Confidential Information about, in any such case while employed by the Company or an Affiliate. 
              (b) 
    Additionally, for consideration provided under this Agreement, including, but not limited to the Company s agreement to provide Executive with Confidential Information regarding the Company and its respective businesses, Executive agrees that while employed by the Company or an Affiliate and for [____] months following a Covered Termination he/she will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, acting alone or in conjunction with others, either directly or indirectly, engage in any business that is in competition with the Company or an Affiliate or accept employment with or render services at a comparable level of responsibility to such a business as an officer, agent, employee, independent contractor or consultant, or otherwise engage in activities that are in competition with the Company or an Affiliate. 
              (c) 
    The restrictions contained in this Section 9 are limited to areas or territories within the United States and in any foreign country in which the Company or an Affiliate engages (or has definite plans to engage) in operations or the marketing of its products or services at the time of Executive s Separation from Service. 
     
   6 

Exhibit 10.1 

(d) 
    Executive acknowledges that these restrictive covenants under this Agreement, for which Executive received valuable consideration from the Company as provided in this Agreement, including, but not limited to the Company s agreement to provide Executive with Confidential Information regarding the Company and its respective businesses, are ancillary to otherwise enforceable provisions of this Agreement, that the consideration provided by the Company gives rise to the interest of each of the Company in restraining Executive from competing and that the restrictive covenants are designed to enforce Executive s consideration or return promises under this Agreement.  Additionally, Executive acknowledges that these restrictive covenants contain limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained that are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other legitimate business interests of the Company, including, but not limited to, the Company s need to protect its Confidential Information.  Executive further acknowledges that a violation on Executive s part of any of the restrictive covenants contained in Section 7 or this Section 9 of this Agreement would cause immeasurable and irreparable damage to the Company.  Accordingly, Executive agrees that, in addition to any other remedy the Company may have for any such violation:  (1) the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or threatened violation of any such covenant in addition to any other remedies it may have; and (2) in addition, if the General Counsel of the Company (or other similarly situated senior executive of the Company) reasonably and in good faith determines that Executive has materially breached any of these restrictive covenants contained in this Section 9 of the Agreement during the applicable period in which they are in effect, after written notice to Executive of such determination and a ten (10) day opportunity to cure such breach (if the General Counsel determines in good faith that such breach is curable), if such breach is not so cured to the reasonable satisfaction of the General Counsel, then Executive shall be required to promptly repay all net after-tax cash amounts previously paid under this Agreement to Executive, and Executive shall forfeit any Equity Awards he or she may then hold. 
              6. 
    NOTICES  :  For purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications must be in writing and will be deemed to have been given when personally delivered or when mailed by United States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

  This Change in Control Severance Agreement (   Agreement   ) is by and between Babcock   Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. (the    Company   ) and _____________ (   Executive   ). 
  WHEREAS  , (a) the Company considers it essential to the interests of the Company s stockholders to encourage the continued employment of key management personnel, (b) the Board of Directors of the Company recognizes that the possibility of a Change in Control (as defined in Exhibit A to this Agreement) exists and that the uncertainty this raises may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders, and (c) in order to encourage the continued attention and dedication of key management personnel, this Agreement is being entered into by the Company and Executive; and 
  WHEREAS  , Executive acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is supported by good and valuable consideration in the form of continued employment by the Company, the Company s promises under this Agreement, and the benefits described below.  
  NOW, THEREFORE  , in exchange for the premises and mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and other good and valid consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the Company and Executive agree as follows: 
           1. 
    DEFINITIONS  :  Capitalized terms are defined in Exhibit A to this Agreement. 
              2. 
    SEVERANCE BENEFITS  :  If Executive experiences a Covered Termination he or she     will be entitled to the payments and benefits set forth below; provided that the benefits described in Sections 2(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) shall only be payable if Executive executes a waiver and release prepared by the Company, which releases the Company and its affiliates, directors, officers and other customary persons from any claim or liability arising out of or related to Executive s employment with or termination of employment from the Company or any of its affiliates (except for amounts to which Executive is legally entitled pursuant to employee benefit plans, Executive s right to enforce this Agreement and rights to insurance coverage or indemnification) (the    Release   ), which Release is not revoked within the time period provided therein, and the executed Release is delivered to the Company no later than forty-five (45) days after the Covered Termination. 
              (a) 
    Accrued Benefits  .  The Accrued Benefits, payable within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Covered Termination, or such earlier time as may be required by applicable law.

(as applicable), payable in accordance with the terms of SERP and/or Restoration Plan, as applicable. 
           (c) 
    Unvested Equity Awards  .  As of the effective date of the Covered Termination, unless otherwise settled in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 of this Agreement and the plans and agreements referred to therein, a fully vested and non-forfeitable interest in any outstanding unvested equity awards granted on Company Shares (   Equity Awards   ), to be vested and, in the case of restricted stock units, settled, in any such case within the 60   th    day after the effective date of the Covered Termination; provided that no such Equity Award that is subject to Code Section 409A will be paid on a date earlier than is provided in the applicable Equity Award agreement to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of tax penalties pursuant to Code Section 409A; provided further that any performance-based Equity Awards shall be settled with respect to the number of Company Shares earned based on the target rate of performance applicable to such award.  In addition, any Equity Awards that are vested (including as a result of the foregoing provision) options to purchase Company Shares that Executive holds as of the date of his or her Covered Termination will remain exercisable through the expiration of the original term of such option. 
              (d) 
    Severance Payment Based on Salary  .  An amount equal to [__] times the sum of Executive s (x) Salary plus (y) the product of (1) Salary and (2) Target Bonus Percentage, paid in a lump sum in cash within sixty (60) days after the Covered Termination. 
              (e) 
    Severance Payment Based on Bonus  . 
              (1)

              (2) 
    Prior Performance Year  .  If a bonus for the prior calendar year has not been paid under the Bonus Plan as of Executive s effective date of the Covered Termination, then Executive will be entitled to the actual amount of the bonus determined under the Bonus Plan for such prior calendar year (such amount to be determined without the exercise of any downward discretion), paid in a lump sum in cash at the same time such bonus is paid to other Bonus Plan participants. 
     
   2 

Exhibit 10.2 

(f) 
    Health Care Benefits  .  An amount equal to three (3) times the full annual cost that would be payable by Executive for continuation of coverage for medical, dental and vision benefits if elected by Executive for him/herself and his/her eligible dependents under COBRA for the year in which Executive s Covered Termination occurs, paid in a lump sum in cash within sixty (60) days after the Covered Termination.  For purposes of clarity, the payment contemplated by this Section 2(f) shall be paid to Executive irrespective of whether Executive elects COBRA and Executive shall not be obligated to use such amounts for payment of COBRA premiums (if so elected). 
     In no event shall the benefits provided for in Sections 2(a), (d), (e) and (f) above or any payment provided for in (c) above that is not subject to Code Section 409A be paid later than March 15th of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which      Executive s Covered Termination Date occurs.  For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a Covered Termination, in no event shall Executive be eligible for or entitled to any other severance payments or benefits under any other severance plan, program or policy maintained by the Company or any of its Affiliates. 
           3. 
    LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS  :  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any amount or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement would be an  Excess Parachute Payment,  within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, but for the application of this sentence, then the payments and benefits identified in the last sentence of this Section 3 to be paid or provided under this Agreement will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment; provided, however, that no such reduction shall be made if it is not thereby possible to eliminate all Excess Parachute Payments under this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing reduction will be made only if and to the extent that such reduction would result in an increase in the aggregate payment and benefits to he provided, determined on an after-tax basis (taking into account the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law, and any applicable federal, state and local income and employment taxes).  Whether requested by Executive or the Company, the determination of whether any reduction in such payments or benefits to be provided under this Agreement or otherwise is required pursuant to the preceding sentence will be made at the expense of the Company by the Company s independent accountants, which determination shall take into account a reasonable compensation analysis of the value of services provided or to be provided by Executive, including Executive s agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a covenant not to compete or similar covenant applicable to Executive (including, without limitation, those contemplated by Sections 6, 7 and 8 of this Agreement). 
     
   3 

Exhibit 10.2 

The fact that Executive s right to payments or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this Section 3 will not of itself limit or otherwise affect any other rights of Executive other than pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided under this Agreement or otherwise is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section 3, the Company will reduce Executive s payment and/or benefits, to the extent required, in the following order: (i) the lump sum payment provided under Section 2(d); (ii) the lump sum payment provided under Section 2(e)(1); (iii) the lump sum payment related to Health Care Benefits provided under Section 2(f); and (iv) the accelerated vesting of equity-based awards described in Section 2(c). 
           4. 
    CHANGE IN CONTROL EQUITY-BASED BENEFITS  :  If a Change in Control occurs, any benefits Executive may be entitled to with respect to any equity-based compensation (including any Equity Awards) shall be determined in accordance with the applicable plans and award agreements.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any such plans or award agreement and Section 2(c) of this Agreement, the terms of such plan or award agreement shall control to the extent such plan or award agreement provides for accelerated vesting or settlement in connection with a Change in Control (either upon the occurrence of such an event or thereafter).  For the avoidance of doubt, if any given equity-based compensation award agreement is silent with respect to the effect of a Change in Control and the plan pursuant to which any such award agreement is granted does not contain provisions that would automatically apply to the given award, then Section 2(c) of this Agreement shall control. 
     
   4 

Exhibit 10.2 

(a) 
    Compliance  .  It is the intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement either comply with Code Section 409A and the Treasury regulations and guidance issued thereunder or that one or more elements of compensation or benefits be exempt from Code Section 409A.  Accordingly, the parties intend that this Agreement be interpreted and operated in a manner consistent with such requirements in order to avoid the application of penalty taxes under Code Section 409A to the extent reasonably practicable.  The Company shall neither cause nor permit:  (i) any payment, benefit or consideration to be substituted for a benefit that is payable under this Agreement if such action would result in the failure of any amount that is subject to Code Section 409A to comply with the applicable requirements of Code Section 409A; or (ii) any adjustments to any equity interest to be made in a manner that would result in the equity interest s becoming subject to Code Section 409A unless, after such adjustment, the equity interest is in compliance with the requirements of Code Section 409A to the extent applicable.  A Covered Termination shall constitute an  involuntary separation from service  for purposes of Code Section 409A. 
              (b) 
    Waiting Period for Specified Employees  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if Executive is a  Specified Employee  (as that term is defined in Code Section 409A) as of Executive s Covered Termination Date, then any amounts or benefits which are payable under this Agreement upon Executive s  Separation from Service  (within the meaning of Code Section 409A), which are subject to the provisions of Code Section 409A and not otherwise exempt under Code Section 409A, and would otherwise be payable during the first six-month period following such Separation from Service, shall be paid on the first business day that (i) is at least six months after the date after Executive s Covered Termination Date or (ii) follows Executive s date of death, if earlier (the    Waiting Period   ).  The benefits in Sections 2(a), (d), (e) and (f) and certain of the benefits in Section 2(c) are intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A under the  short-term deferral exemption  and thus the Waiting Period is not intended to apply to such benefits. 
              6. 
    CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE  :  Executive acknowledges that pursuant to this Agreement, the Company agrees to provide to him or her Confidential Information and has previously provided him or her other such Confidential Information.  In return for this and other consideration, provided under this Agreement, Executive agrees that he/she will not, while employed by the Company or any Affiliate and thereafter, disclose or make available to any other person or entity, or use for his or her own personal gain, any Confidential Information, except for such disclosures as required in the performance of his or her duties hereunder as may otherwise be required by law or legal process (in which case  
     
   5 

Exhibit 10.2 

Executive shall notify the Company of such legal or judicial proceeding as soon as practicable following his or her receipt of notice of such a proceeding, and permit the Company to seek to protect its interests and information). 
           7. 
    RETURN OF PROPERTY  :  Executive agrees that at the time of leaving his or her employ with the Company or an Affiliate, he/she will deliver to the Company (and will not keep in his or her possession, recreate or deliver to anyone else) all Confidential Information as well as all other devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, materials, equipment, customer or client lists or information, or any other documents or property (including all reproductions of the aforementioned items) belonging to the Company or any of its Affiliates, regardless of whether such items were prepared by Executive. 
              8. 
    NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-COMPETITION  : 
              (a) 
    For consideration provided under this Agreement, including, but not limited to the Company s agreement to provide Executive with Confidential Information regarding the Company and its respective businesses, Executive agrees that while employed by the Company or an Affiliate and for [_____] months following a Separation from Service during the term of this Agreement he/she shall not, without the prior written consent of the General Counsel, directly or indirectly, (i) hire or induce, entice or solicit (or attempt to induce, entice or solicit) any employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates or ventures to leave the employment of the Company or any of its Affiliates or ventures or (ii) solicit or attempt to solicit the business of any customer or acquisition prospect of the Company or any of its Affiliates or ventures with whom Executive had any actual contact or Confidential Information about, in any such case while employed by the Company or an Affiliate. 
              (b) 
    Additionally, for consideration provided under this Agreement, including, but not limited to the Company s agreement to provide Executive with Confidential Information regarding the Company and its respective businesses, Executive agrees that while employed by the Company or an Affiliate and for [_____] months following a Covered Termination he/she will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, acting alone or in conjunction with others, either directly or indirectly, engage in any business that is in competition with the Company or an Affiliate or accept employment with or render services at a comparable level of responsibility to such a business as an officer, agent, employee, independent contractor or consultant, or otherwise engage in activities that are in competition with the Company or an Affiliate. 
     
   6 

Exhibit 10.2 

(c) 
    The restrictions contained in this Section 8 are limited to areas or territories within the United States and in any foreign country in which the Company or an Affiliate engages (or has definite plans to engage) in operations or the marketing of its products or services at the time of Executive s Separation from Service. 
              (d) 
    Executive acknowledges that these restrictive covenants under this Agreement, for which Executive received valuable consideration from the Company as provided in this Agreement, including, but not limited to the Company s agreement to provide Executive with Confidential Information regarding the Company and its respective businesses, are ancillary to otherwise enforceable provisions of this Agreement, that the consideration provided by the Company gives rise to the interest of each of the Company in restraining Executive from competing and that the restrictive covenants are designed to enforce Executive s consideration or return promises under this Agreement.  Additionally, Executive acknowledges that these restrictive covenants contain limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained that are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other legitimate business interests of the Company, including, but not limited to, the Company s need to protect its Confidential Information.  Executive further acknowledges that a violation on Executive s part of any of the restrictive covenants contained in Section 6 or this Section 8 of this Agreement would cause immeasurable and irreparable damage to the Company.  Accordingly, Executive agrees that, in addition to any other remedy the Company may have for any such violation:  (1) the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or threatened violation of any such covenant in addition to any other remedies it may have; and (2) in addition, if the General Counsel of the Company (or other similarly situated senior executive of the Company) reasonably and in good faith determines that Executive has materially breached any of these restrictive covenants contained in this Section 8 of the Agreement during the applicable period in which they are in effect, after written notice to Executive of such determination and a ten (10) day opportunity to cure such breach (if the General Counsel determines in good faith that such breach is curable), if such breach is not so cured to the reasonable satisfaction of the General Counsel, then Executive shall be required to promptly repay all net after-tax cash amounts previously paid under this Agreement to Executive, and Executive shall forfeit any Equity Awards he or she may then hold.

              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              c. 
    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
