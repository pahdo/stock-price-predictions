2.  
  Basis of Presentation       The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, which the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods shown. The condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X, and, therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of consolidated financial position, results of
operations, comprehensive (loss) income and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.    The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
RTI Surgical, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Pioneer Surgical Technology, Inc. ( Pioneer ), Tutogen Medical, Inc. ( TMI ), RTI Surgical, Inc.   Cardiovascular (inactive), Biological Recovery Group, Inc. (inactive)
and RTI Services, Inc. (inactive). The condensed consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of RTI Donor Services, Inc. ( RTIDS ), which is a controlled entity.

  Recently Issued Accounting Standards         Compensation   Stock Compensation
    In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation   (Topic 718) ( ASU
2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option
to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 on its condensed consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.  
   Revenue from Contracts with Customers     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with
Customers   (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  . ASU 2014-09 is based on the
principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires
additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill
a contract. As updated in August 2015, the effective date of ASU 2014-09 will be annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, using one of two retrospective application methods.  
 In March and April 2016, the FASB issued two updates to the revenue recognition guidance: ASU 2016-08   Principal Versus Agent
Considerations   (Topic 606) (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net), and ASU 2016-10,   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   (Topic 606).  
 In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU Update No. 2016-12 ( ASU 2016-12 ) which narrowly amended the revenue recognition guidance
regarding collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition.  
      6  

Table of Contents  

  The Company has not determined the impact ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12
will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. However, an implementation project team has been identified and the Company plans to complete its preliminary assessment, which includes a subset of
representative contracts, in 2016. Once the initial evaluation is complete, the Company will expand the scope of its assessment to include all contracts with customers.  
   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs     In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest
  Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   (Topic 835) ( ASU No. 2015-03 ). ASU No. 2015-03 simplifies the accounting for debt issuance costs by requiring such costs to be presented as a
direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. ASU No. 2015-03 requires retrospective application and represents a change
in accounting principle. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 effective January 1, 2016 and has presented debt issuance costs of $341 and $403 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, as a direct deduction from the carrying
amounts of its debt liabilities. The December 31, 2015 amount was previously recorded in  Other assets-net .      

4.  
  Stock-Based Compensation       The Company has six stock-based compensation plans (although
it may currently issue awards only under one of such plans). The Company s policy is to grant stock options at an exercise price equal to 100% of the market value of a share of common stock at closing on the date of the grant. The
Company s stock options generally have ten-year contractual terms and vest over a one to five-year period from the date of grant. The Company s policy is to grant restricted stock awards at a fair value equal to 100% of the market
value of a share of common stock at closing on the date of the grant. The Company s restricted stock awards generally vest over one to three-year periods.  
   2015 Incentive Compensation Plan     On April 14, 2015, the Company s stockholders approved and adopted the 2015
Incentive Compensation Plan, (the  2015 Plan ). The 2015 Plan provides for the grant of incentive and nonqualified stock options and restricted stock to key employees, including officers and directors of the Company and consultants and
advisors. The 2015 Plan allows for up to 4,656,587 shares of common stock to be issued with respect to awards granted.      1998
Stock Option Plan, 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, TMI 1996 Stock Option Plan and TMI 2006 Incentive and Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan     The Company adopted equity incentive plans in 1998 (the  1998
Plan ), 2004 (the  2004 Plan ) and 2010 (the  2010 Plan ) and in connection with the merger with TMI in 2008, the Company assumed the TMI 1996 Stock Option Plan (the  1996 Plan ) and the TMI 2006 Incentive and
Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan (the  2006 Plan ), which provided for the grant of incentive and nonqualified stock options and restricted stock to key employees, including officers and directors of the Company and consultants and
advisors. With the adoption of the 2015 Plan, new stock options and restricted stock may no longer be awarded under the 1998 Plan, 2004 Plan, 2010 Plan, 1996 Plan or the 2006 Plan.  
   Stock Options      As of September 30,
2016, there was $2,974 of total unrecognized stock-based compensation related to nonvested stock options. That expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.12 years.

  Stock options outstanding, exercisable and available for grant at September 30, 2016 are
summarized as follows:      
   The aggregate intrinsic value in the tables above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value of stock
options for which the fair market value of the underlying common stock exceeded the respective stock option exercise price.    Other
information concerning stock options are as follows:      
   The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised in a period represents the pre-tax cumulative
difference, for the stock options exercised during the period, between the fair market value of the underlying common stock and the stock option exercise prices.  
   Restricted Stock Awards      During
the first quarter of 2016, the Company granted 223,563 shares of time-based restricted stock and 223,563 shares of performance-based restricted stock. Both sets of awards vest over a three-year period, with a weighted-average grant date fair value
of $3.31 per share. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company granted 162,160 shares of restricted stock with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $3.70 per share which vest over a one-year period. As of September 30, 2016, there was
$1,735 of total unrecognized stock-based compensation related to time-based and performance-based, nonvested restricted stock. That expense is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of 1.78 years.  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized stock-based compensation as follows:

  Net Income Per Common Share       A reconciliation of the number of shares of common stock
used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per common share is presented below:      
   For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 4,854,771 and 1,736,119, respectively,
and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 4,787,572 and 1,767,376, respectively, of issued stock options were not included in the computation of diluted net income per common share because they were anti-dilutive since
their exercise price exceeded the market price. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, options to purchase 278,766 and 306,527, respectively, of common stock were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share
because dilutive shares are not factored into this calculation when a net loss is reported.    For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, 50,000 shares of convertible preferred stock and accrued but unpaid dividends were anti-dilutive on an as if-converted basis and were not included in the computation of diluted net (loss) income per common share.

  Inventories       Inventories by stage of completion are as follows:  
   
   For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had inventory write-downs of $2,052 and
$1,418, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had inventory write-downs of $4,422 and $4,473, respectively, relating primarily to product obsolescence.

  Short and Long-Term Obligations       Short and long-term obligations are as follows:  
   
   On July 16, 2013, the Company obtained from TD Bank and Regions Bank a five-year $80,000 senior secured
facility, which includes a $60,000 term loan and a $20,000 revolving credit facility that matures on July 16, 2018, with a variable interest rate between 100 and 175 basis points in excess of the one month LIBOR rate. On October 15, 2014, the
Company entered into a Second Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with TD Bank, N.A. and Regions Bank, which amended the loan agreement to remove certain financial covenants. On June 29, 2015, the Company entered into a Third
Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with TD Bank, N.A. and Regions Bank, which increased the maximum revolving credit amount from $20,000 to $30,000. On June 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Second
Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with TD Bank, N.A. and Regions Bank, which increased the maximum revolving credit amount from $30,000 to $45,000.  
 At September 30, 2016, the interest rate for the term loan and revolving credit facility is 2.03%. The facility is secured by substantially
all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and guaranteed by the Company s domestic subsidiaries, other than RTIDS. As of September 30, 2016, there was $33,000 outstanding on the revolving credit facility. The term loan facility
requires aggregate principal payments of $9,375 from October 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018, with a final balloon principal payment at the end of the loan agreement. The credit agreement limits indebtedness and liens, restricts payment of dividends
on common stock, requires the Company to maintain a minimum cash balance on hand of $10,000 and prescribes certain financial covenant ratios. The Company was in compliance with these financial covenants related to its senior secured credit facility
as of September 30, 2016.    In addition to the credit facility with TD Bank and Regions Bank, the Company had through its German
subsidiary, three credit facilities with three German banks. As of September 30, 2016, the three credit facilities with the three German banks were paid off and terminated.  
 The total available credit on the Company s one revolving credit facility at September 30, 2016 was $12,000. The Company s ability
to access its revolving credit facility is subject to and can be limited by its compliance with its financial and other covenants. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants related to its revolving credit facility as of September
30, 2016.

  As of September 30, 2016, the Company paid off all remaining capital leases.  
 On November 7, 2016, as a result of the Company s uncertainty regarding its ability to comply on a quarterly basis with its leverage to
consolidated trailing 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ratio (the  Leverage to EBITDA Ratio ) covenant in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company entered into a Fifth Amendment to the Second Amended
and Restated Loan Agreement with TD Bank, N.A. and Regions Bank. The amendment increased the Company s Leverage to EBITDA Ratio from 2.5 to 1.00 to 3.25 to 1.00 through March 31, 2017, and 3.0 to 1.00 after March 31, 2017. As of September 30,
2016, the Company s leverage ratio was approximately 2.33. The amendment also decreased the Company s maximum revolving credit amount from $45,000 to $42,500 and placed certain restrictions on the payment of preferred dividends.  
 As of September 30, 2016, contractual maturities of long-term obligations are as follows:  

The Company expects its deferred tax assets of $21,555, net of the
valuation allowance at September 30, 2016 of $2,587, to be realized through the generation of future taxable income and the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences.  
 Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts which are more likely than not to be
realized. As such, valuation allowances of $2,587 and $1,106 have been established at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, against a portion of the deferred tax assets relating to certain net operating loss carryforwards.
   U.S. income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of the Company s foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable
to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable. The Company s intention is to indefinitely reinvest earnings of its foreign subsidiaries outside of the U.S.  
 The Company evaluates the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances based on a more likely than not standard. The ability to realize
deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction.  
 The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available positive and negative
evidence. It is difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. The Company utilizes a rolling three years of actual
results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years.    On a rolling three year basis, the Company s U.S. operations
are in a cumulative income position. The Company considers this objectively verifiable evidence that its current U.S. operations existing on September 30, 2016, have consistently demonstrated the ability to operate at a profit. The Company
has a history of utilizing 100 percent of its U.S. deferred taxes assets before they expire and the forecasts of taxable earnings project a complete realization of all U.S. deferred tax assets before they expire, including under stressed scenarios.
   The Company s German and French operations are in cumulative loss positions. Since inception, the Company s French
operations have generated losses. As a result, the Company has historically recorded a full valuation allowance on its French subsidiary s deferred tax assets. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company s German
operations entered into a cumulative loss position. As a result, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance on its German subsidiary s deferred tax assets.  
 The Company will continue to regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Changes in historical earnings performance and
future earnings projections, among other factors, may cause the Company to adjust its valuation allowance, which would impact the Company s income tax expense in the period the Company determines that these factors have changed.  
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company s German subsidiary completed an examination by the German tax authorities. The
examination covered the German subsidiary s 2010 through 2013 tax years. No material adjustments were recorded as a result of the German examination.      
   On June 12, 2013, the Company and WSHP Biologics Holdings, LLC, an
affiliate of Water Street Healthcare Partners, a leading healthcare-focused private equity firm ( Water Street ), entered into an investment agreement. Pursuant to

the terms of the investment agreement, the Company issued $50,000 of convertible preferred equity to Water Street in a private placement which closed on July 16, 2013, with preferred stock
issuance costs of $1,290. The preferred stock accrues dividends at a rate of 6% per annum. To the extent dividends are not paid in cash in any quarter, the dividends which have accrued on each outstanding share of preferred stock during such
three-month period will accumulate until paid in cash or converted to common stock. Our credit agreement with TD Bank and Regions Bank contains various covenants of financial conditions which, if not met, would restrict the Company from paying
dividends.    Preferred stock is as follows:      

13.  
  Restructuring Charges       The Company instituted a restructuring plan primarily related to
closure of our French distribution and tissue procurement office, which resulted in $1,107 of expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.      

14.  
  Strategic Review Costs       The Company recorded strategic review costs related to the
comprehensive strategic review of the Company s business lines and operations to leverage the Company s expertise, technology and products and identify opportunities to increase stockholder value, which resulted in $650 of expenses for the

15.  
  CEO Retirement and Transition Costs       The Company recorded Chief Executive Officer
retirement and transition costs related to the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer, Brian K. Hutchison, pursuant to the Executive Transition Agreement dated August 29, 2012, which resulted in $4,107 of expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.      

16.  
  Contested Proxy Expenses       The Company recorded contested proxy expenses related to the
contested proxy between the Company and Krensavage Partners, LP, which resulted in $2,680 of expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.      
   The Company recorded severance charges related to the termination of
former employees as a result of the Company reorganizing its distribution force, which resulted in $995 of expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2015.  
 The Company recorded additional severance charges to reduce headcount and improve operational efficiencies, which resulted in $1,039 of expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. The total severance charges are expected to be paid in full prior to the fourth quarter of 2018. Severance payments are made to terminated employees over periods ranging from one month to twenty-four months and
are not expected to have a material impact on cash flows of the Company in any quarterly period. The following table includes a rollforward of severance charges included in accrued expenses, see Note 9.

The Company is, from time to time, involved in litigation relating to
claims arising out of its operations in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that none of these claims that were outstanding as of September 30, 2016 will have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of
operations.      Coloplast     The Company is presently named as co-defendant along with other companies in a small
percentage of the transvaginal surgical mesh ( TSM ) mass tort claims being brought in various state and federal courts. The TSM litigation has as its catalyst various Public Health Notifications issued by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration ( FDA ) with respect to the placement of certain TSM implants that were the subject of 510k regulatory clearance prior to their distribution. The Company does not process or otherwise manufacture for distribution in the U.S.
any implants that were the subject of these FDA Public Health Notifications. The Company denies any allegations against it and intends to continue to vigorously defend itself.  
 In addition to claims made directly against the Company, Coloplast, a manufacturer and distributor of TSM s and a distributor of certain
allografts processed and private labeled for them under a contract with the Company, has also been named as a defendant in individual TSM cases in various federal and state courts. Coloplast requested that the Company indemnify or defend
Coloplast in those claims which allege injuries caused by the Company s allograft implants, and on April 24, 2014, Coloplast sued RTI Surgical, Inc. in the Fourth Judicial District of Minnesota for declaratory relief and breach of
contract. On December 11, 2014, Coloplast entered into a settlement agreement with RTI Surgical, Inc. and Tutogen Medical, Inc. (the  Company Parties ) resulting in dismissal of the case. Under the terms of the settlement
agreement, the Company Parties are responsible for the defense and indemnification of two categories of present and future claims: (1) tissue only (where Coloplast is solely the distributor of Company processed allograft tissue and no
Coloplast-manufactured or distributed synthetic mesh is identified), and (2) tissue plus non-Coloplast synthetic mesh ( collectively, the Claims ). There are presently a combined total of 1,126 Claims for which the Company Parties are
providing defense and indemnification. The defense and indemnification of these cases are covered under the Company s insurance policy subject to a reservation of rights by the insurer.  
 Based on the current information available to the Company, it is not possible to evaluate and estimate with reasonable certainty the impact
that current or any future TSM litigation may have on the Company.    The Company s accounting policy is to accrue for legal costs as
they are incurred.     19. Regulatory Actions   
 In the quarter ended September 30, 2014, the Company received a letter from the FDA regarding the Company s map3    cellular allogeneic bone graft. The letter addresses some technical aspects of the processing of the map3    allograft, as well as language
included on the Company s website. The Company has submitted an initial response to the FDA letter and a comprehensive package of data to address the FDA s comments and provide clarifying information regarding the technical components of
the implant processing. The Company believes that in both developing and processing of map3   , the Company has properly considered the relevant regulatory requirements. Additionally, the
Company has removed the relevant information from the website pending thorough review and revisions as needed. The Company is committed to resolving the concerns raised by the FDA. However, it is not possible to predict the specific outcome or
timing of a resolution at this time.     20. Commitments and Contingencies   
   Distribution Agreement with Davol   - On July 13, 2009, the Company and Davol amended their previous distribution agreement with
TMI for human dermis implants. Under the amended agreement: 1) Davol paid the Company $8,000 in non-refundable fees for exclusive distribution rights for the distribution to the breast reconstruction market until July 13, 2019; 2) the exclusive
worldwide distribution agreement related to the hernia market was extended to July 13, 2019; and 3) Davol agreed to pay the Company certain additional exclusive distribution rights fees contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue milestones
by Davol during the duration of the contract. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Davol paid the first revenue  
      14  

Table of Contents  

milestone payment of $3,500. The non-refundable fees and the fees associated with distributions of processed tissue are considered to be a single unit of accounting. Accordingly, the $8,000 and
$3,500 exclusivity payments were deferred and were being recognized as other revenues on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the amended contract of ten years, and the remaining term of the amended contract, respectively. Davol did not
achieve certain revenue growth milestones which resulted in Davol relinquishing its exclusive distribution rights in the hernia market effective January 1, 2013 and in the breast reconstruction market effective January 1, 2015. As a result, the
Company recognized additional deferred revenue as other revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2015, of $1,500, due to the acceleration of deferred revenue recognition relating to Davol relinquishing its exclusive distribution rights in
the breast reconstruction markets. The remaining balance is being recognized as other revenues on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the amended contract.  
  21. Segment Data     The Company distributes
human tissue, bovine and porcine animal tissue, metal and synthetic implants through various distribution channels. The Company operates in one reportable segment composed of six lines of business. Effective January 1, 2016, the reporting of the
Company s lines of business is composed primarily of six categories: spine; sports medicine and orthopedics; surgical specialties; cardiothoracic; international; and global commercial. The Company s previous lines of business were composed
of: spine; ortho fixation; sports medicine; bone graft substitutes and general orthopedic; dental; and surgical specialties. The prior year comparable revenue information has been restated to conform to the current year presentation. The Company
believes that the change in the reporting of the Company s lines of business will facilitate a better understanding of our lines of business and align more closely with the end markets in which the Company competes. Discrete financial
information is not available for these six lines of business. The following table presents revenues from these six categories and other revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:

Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as may have been in subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (including this one), constitute cautionary statements which identify some of the factors regarding these forward-looking statements,
including certain risks and uncertainties, that could cause actual results to vary materially from the future results indicated in these forward-looking statements. Other factors could also cause actual results to vary materially from the future
results indicated in such forward-looking statements.     Management Overview   
 RTI Surgical, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures and distributes surgical implants for use in a variety of
surgical procedures. We are a leader in providing tissue implants as well as metal and synthetic implants for the benefit of surgeons and patients worldwide. We process donated human musculoskeletal and other tissues including bone,
cartilage, tendons, ligaments, fascia lata, pericardium, sclera, cornea and dermal tissues, as well as bovine and porcine animal tissues to produce allograft and xenograft implants. We process the majority of our tissue implants using our
proprietary BIOCLEANSE   , TUTOPLAST    and CANCELLE    SP sterilization
processes. In addition, we manufacture, market and distribute metal and synthetic implants for treatment of spinal and other orthopedic disorders. Our implants are used in the fields of spine, ortho fixation, sports medicine, bone graft
substitutes and general orthopedic, surgical specialties, cardiothoracic and dental. We distribute our implants to hospitals and surgeons in the United States and internationally through a direct distribution organization, as well as through a
network of independent distributors. We were founded in 1997 and are headquartered in Alachua, Florida.    Domestic distributions and
services accounted for 91% of total revenues in the first nine months of 2016. Most of our implants are distributed directly to healthcare providers, hospitals and other healthcare facilities through a direct distribution force and through various
strategic relationships.    International distributions and services accounted for 9% of total revenues in the first nine months of 2016.
Our implants are distributed in over 45 countries through a direct distribution force in Germany and through stocking distributors in the rest of the world outside of Germany and the U.S.  
 Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopedic implant surgeries and elective procedures generally
declines during the summer months.    Our principal goals are to honor the gift of donated tissue, donor families and patients while
building our competitive strength in the marketplace to increase revenues, profitability and cash flow as we focus on improved operational efficiency, productivity and asset management. We are making investments in new implant and product
development and our direct distribution network in an effort to promote growth in 2016 and beyond.    We continue to maintain our commitment
to research and development and the introduction of new strategically targeted allograft, xenograft, metal and synthetic implants as well as focused clinical efforts to support their acceptance in the marketplace. In addition, we consider strategic
acquisitions from time to time for new implants and technologies intended to augment our existing implant offerings.     Critical Accounting Policies
      Intangible Assets and Goodwill  . Our cash flow projections were a significant input into the December 31, 2015 reporting
unit fair value. Our revenues of $201.5 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 declined by 2.3% as compared to the prior year period, in which we generated revenues of $206.2 million. Despite the lower level of revenues in the
current nine month period as compared with the prior year revenues, we generated cash from operations totaling $10.0 million, which increased by $7.6 million, or 314.1% despite the 2.3% year over year decrease in revenues. We update our
financial projections on a regular basis as business conditions and our expectation of financial performance change. In addition, we are conducting a strategic review of our business lines and operations which could result in a change in our
strategic focus and impact our financial projections. Should our cash flow projections decline to levels inconsistent with our previously projected results, long-term projections may be adjusted downward. A downward adjustment could negatively
impact future valuations of our single reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge, and depending on the specific changes, could be material to us.

   Results of Operations   
  Consolidated Financial Results     The
following table reflects revenues for the three and  nine  months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      
     Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Total Revenues.    Effective January 1, 2016, the reporting of our lines of business are composed primarily of six categories:
spine; sports medicine and orthopedics; surgical specialties; cardiothoracic; international; and global commercial. Our previous lines of business were composed of: spine; ortho fixation; sports medicine; bone graft substitutes and general
orthopedic; dental; and surgical specialties. The prior year comparable revenue information has been restated to conform to the current year presentation. We believe that the change in the reporting of our lines of business will facilitate a better
understanding of our lines of business and align more closely with the end markets in which we compete.    Our total revenues of $66.5
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were comparable to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our direct revenues increased by $4.8 million, or 14.5%, to $38.1 million, offset by our global commercial revenues which
decreased by $4.9 million, or 16.2%, to $25.3 million. Our global commercial revenue comparisons are impacted due to a significant amount of our revenue being derived from large global commercial stocking distributors, whose timing of orders can
vary from quarter to quarter. These ordering patterns can result in significant unit volume variations, which can result in significant variation in quarter over quarter comparisons. In addition, global commercial revenues decreased primarily as a
result of lower orders from certain commercial distributors, primarily in the spinal and trauma markets.     Direct Revenues   
  Spine -  Revenues from spinal implants increased $4.1 million, or 30.0%, to $17.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to $13.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Spine revenues increased primarily as a result of new surgeon customers.

30, 2016. Costs of processing and distribution as a percentage was negatively impacted by a decrease in manufacturing processing activities as a result of lower global commercial revenue distributions.  
  Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses

understanding of our lines of business and align more closely with the end markets in which we compete.    Our total revenues decreased by
$4.7 million, or 2.3%, to $201.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $206.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our direct revenues increased by $13.9 million, or 13.6%, to $116.3 million, offset
by our global commercial revenues which decreased by $17.7 million, or 19.0%, to $75.4 million. Our global commercial revenue comparisons are impacted due to a significant amount of our revenue being derived from large global commercial stocking
distributors, whose timing of orders can vary from quarter to quarter. These ordering patterns can result in significant unit volume variations, which can result in significant variation in quarter over quarter comparisons. In addition, global
commercial revenues decreased primarily as a result of lower orders from certain commercial distributors, primarily in the spinal, dental and trauma markets.

Krensavage Partners, LP. There were no contested proxy expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.     Severance
Charges     Severance charges related to the termination of other former employees resulted in $1.0 million of expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. There were no severance charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.     Net Other
Expense     Net other expense, which includes interest expense, interest income and foreign exchange loss, increased $126,000 to $1.1
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net other expense is primarily attributable to higher interest expense of $80,000 as a result of higher average
debt balance as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and due to a foreign currency exchange transaction

loss of $59,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $8,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, resulting from changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the
Euro and the timing of payments on foreign currency liabilities.     Income Tax Provision   
 Income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $338,000 compared to $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 10.7% compared to 36.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ending September 30, 2016, the Company s German operations entered
into a cumulative loss position. As a result, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance of $1.2 million on its German subsidiary s deferred tax assets with no comparable charge recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
    Non-GAAP Financial Measures     We
utilize certain financial measures that are not calculated based on GAAP. Certain of these financial measures are considered  non-GAAP  financial measures within the meaning of Item 10 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). We believe that non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of
our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by our management to evaluate financial results and to plan and forecast future periods. However, non-GAAP
financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures used by us may differ from the non-GAAP measures
used by other companies, including our competitors.    To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented on
a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts, including non-GAAP net income applicable to common shares, adjusted. The calculation of the tax effect on the adjustments between GAAP net (loss) income
applicable to common shares and non-GAAP net income applicable to common shares is based upon our estimated annual GAAP tax rate, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP net (loss) income applicable to common shares in calculating non-GAAP
net income applicable to common shares. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are included in the reconciliation below:  
   
   The following is an explanation of the adjustment that management excluded as part of the non-GAAP measures
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as well as the reasons for excluding the individual items:    Restructuring charges
  This adjustment represents the closure of our French distribution and tissue procurement office. Management removes the amount of these costs from our operating results to supplement a comparison to our past operating performance.  
 Contested proxy expenses   This adjustment represent charges relating to contested proxy expenses. Management removes the amount of
these costs from our operating results to supplement a comparison to our past operating performance.  
      22  

Table of Contents  

  Severance charges   This adjustment represents charges relating to the termination of former
employees. Management removes the amount of these costs from our operating results to supplement a comparison to our past operating performance.  
 Strategic review costs   This adjustment represents charges relating to a comprehensive strategic review of the Company s business
lines and operations to leverage the Company s expertise, technology and products and identify opportunities to increase stockholder value. Management removes the amount of these expenses from our operating results to supplement a
comparison to our past operating performance.    CEO Retirement and transition costs   This adjustment represents charges relating to
the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer, Brian K. Hutchison, pursuant to the Executive Transition Agreement dated August 29, 2012 and Executive Separation Agreement dated August 15, 2016. Management removes the amount of these expenses
from our operating results to supplement a comparison to our past operating performance.     Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 Our working capital at September 30, 2016 of $132.7 million was comparable to our working capital at December 31, 2015. 
 At September 30, 2016, we had 51 days of revenues outstanding in trade accounts receivable, a decrease of 10 days compared to December 31,
2015. The decrease was due to higher cash receipts from customers than shipments and corresponding billings to customers during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 At September 30, 2016, we had 344 days of inventory on hand, an increase of 24 days compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in inventory
days is primarily due to a planned investment in inventory for planned future growth of direct distributions and lower than anticipated commercial distributions. We believe that our inventory levels will be adequate to support our on-going
operations for the next twelve months.    We had $11.6 million of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016,
our foreign subsidiaries held $1.1 million in cash, which is not available for use in the U.S. without incurring U.S. taxes. U.S. income taxes have not been paid or accrued for on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We intend to
indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We do not believe that this policy of indefinitely reinvesting the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will have a material adverse effect on the business as a whole.  
 Our short and long-term obligations at September 30, 2016 increased $4.2 million to $83.4 million from $79.2 million at December 31, 2015. The
increase in short and long-term obligations was primarily due to planned additional borrowings to reduce current liabilities partially offset by principal payments on long-term obligations. On June 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Fourth
Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with TD Bank, N.A. and Regions Bank, which increased the maximum revolving credit amount from $30.0 million to $45.0 million. At September 30, 2016, our three credit facilities with three
German banks were paid off and terminated and we have $12.0 million of borrowing capacity available under our one remaining revolving credit facility with TD Bank, N.A. and Regions Bank.  
 We have access to liquidity through our working capital and revolving credit facility with TD Bank, N.A. and Regions Bank. Our debt agreement
contains certain financial covenants including a maximum leverage to trailing 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ratio (the  Leverage to EBITDA Ratio ) of 3.25 to 1.00 through March 31, 2017 and 3.00
to 1.00 thereafter. The debt agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum of $10 million of cash. Therefore, our ability to access liquidity could be limited by the covenants in the debt agreement. As of September 30, 2016, our Leverage to
EBITDA Ratio is approximately 2.33 to 1.00. We update our financial projections on a regular basis as business conditions and our expectation of financial performance change. In addition, we are conducting a strategic review of our business lines
and operations which could result in a change in our strategic focus and impact our financial projections; however as of September 30, 2016, we believe that our working capital, together with our borrowing ability under our one remaining revolving
credit facility, will be adequate to fund our on-going operations for the next twelve months.    As of September 30, 2016, we have no
material off-balance sheet arrangements.    Certain Commitments.   
 Our short and long-term debt obligations and availability of credit as of September 30, 2016 are as follows:

  These amounts consist of contractual obligations for capital expenditures and open purchase orders.     
 We were in compliance with the financial covenants related to our senior secured credit facility as of September 30, 2016.

     Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk     We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based upon our financing, investing and cash management
activities. We are exposed to interest rate risk in the United States and Germany. Changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and interest expense on revolving credit arrangements. We have not entered
into derivative transactions related to cash and cash equivalents or debt. Our borrowings under our term loan and credit facility expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2016, our outstanding floating rate
indebtedness totaled $83.4 million. The primary base interest rate is LIBOR. Other outstanding debt consists of fixed rate instruments, including capital leases. We do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material adverse effect on
our income or our cash flows in 2016. However, we can give no assurance that interest rates will not significantly change in the future.  
 The value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Euro affects our financial results. Changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect
revenues, gross margins, operating expenses and net income. Our international operations currently transact business primarily in the Euro. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the period end exchange rate while revenues
and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Intercompany transactions are translated from the Euro to the U.S. dollar. We do not expect changes in exchange rates to have a material adverse effect on our income or our
cash flows for the remainder of 2016. However, we can give no assurance that exchange rates will not significantly change in the future.      
 Item 4.    Controls and Procedures     As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was
performed on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Disclosure
controls and procedures include controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.    We are in the process of expanding the use of the enterprise resource
system, SAP. On August 31, 2016, we completed a phase of our implementation of SAP. We continue to evaluate the impact to our internal control over financial reporting due to the continuing implementation of SAP. There have been no changes in the
Company s internal control during the Company s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

     PART II.    OTHER INFORMATION   
    Item 1.    Legal Proceedings   
 The Company is, from time to time, involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the ordinary course of business.
The Company believes that none of these claims that were outstanding as of September 30, 2016 will have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations.  
 For a further description, we refer you to Part I, Item 1, Note 18 entitled  Legal Actions  to the condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of current legal proceedings.       Item
1A.    Risk Factors       Our health insurance and prescription drug coverage, along with our self-insurance
reserves, may not cover future claims.      For the health insurance year beginning January 1, 2016, we began to self-insure for our
U.S. employees  medical and prescription drug insurance coverage. We are responsible for losses up to certain retention limits on both a per-claim and aggregate basis.  
 For policies under which we are responsible for losses, we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid
as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing
circumstances. Fluctuating healthcare costs, severity of claims, increases in the employee population, and deviations from our expectations could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. If actual claims are greater in
number and/or severity compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. Unanticipated changes may produce
materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs, which could adversely impact our operating results.
