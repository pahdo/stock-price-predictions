  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  Unaudited - Amounts in thousands except per share data and percentages 
   
  (1) Basis of Presentation 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by A. M. Castle   Co. and subsidiaries (the  Company ), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2015   is derived from the audited financial statements at that date. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of management, the unaudited statements included herein contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of financial results for the interim period. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (as amended) and the Current Report on Form 8-K filed May 26, 2016, which revised the Company financial statement presentation and disclosures to reflect discontinued operations related to the sale of substantially all the assets of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Total Plastics, Inc. ("TPI"). The   2016   interim results reported herein may not necessarily be indicative of the results of the Company s operations for the full year. 
  In March 2016, the Company completed the sale of substantially all the assets of TPI. TPI is reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation, and all the data in this filing has been recast to present TPI as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.       
   
  (2) New Accounting Standards 
  Standards Updates Issued Not Yet Effective 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments," to reduce the existing diversity in practice related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues and apply to all entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230. For public companies, the amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting," which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions. Under ASU No. 2016-09, a Company recognizes all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, eliminating the notion of the additional paid-in capital pool and significantly reducing the complexity and cost of accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies. For interim reporting purposes, excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are considered discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur and are not included in the estimate of an entity s annual effective tax rate. ASU No. 2016-09 further eliminates the requirement to defer recognition of an excess tax benefit until the benefit is realized through a reduction to taxes payable. For public companies, the ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption will be permitted in any interim or annual period for which financial statements have not yet been issued or have not been made available for issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)," which requires that lessees recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms greater than twelve months in the statement of financial position. ASU No. 2016-02 also requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern," providing additional guidance surrounding the disclosure of going concern uncertainties in the financial statements and implementing requirements for management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. The  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company will begin performing the periodic assessments required by the ASU on its effective date and is currently assessing whether the adoption of the ASU will result in additional disclosures. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," related to revenue recognition. The underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in prior accounting guidance. The ASU provides alternative methods of initial adoption. ASU No. 2015-14, "Deferral of the Effective Date," was issued in August 2015 to defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for public companies until annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),  ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  and ASU No. 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients," which provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to ASC No. 2014-09. ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10 and ASU No. 2016-12 must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. The Company is currently reviewing the guidance and assessing the potential impact of these ASU's on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
  (3) Discontinued Operation 
  On March 15, 2016, the Company completed the sale of TPI for   $55,070   in cash, subject to customary working capital adjustments. Under the terms of the sale,   $1,500   of the purchase price was placed into escrow pending adjustment based upon the final calculation of the working capital at closing. The Company and the buyer agreed to the final working capital adjustment during the third quarter of 2016, which resulted in the full escrowed amount being returned to the buyer and the Company reducing its pre-tax gain on the sale of TPI by   $2,214  . The sale resulted in pre-tax and after-tax gains of   $2,003   and   $1,306  , respectively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Prior to the sale of TPI, the Company had two reportable segments consisting of its Plastics segment and its Metals segment. Subsequent to the sale of TPI, which represented the Company's Plastics segment in its entirety, the Company has only one reportable segment. 
  Summarized results of the discontinued operation were as follows: 

(a)   Interest expense was allocated to the discontinued operation based on the debt that was required to be paid as a result of the sale of TPI. 
   (b)    Income tax benefit for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   includes   $4,207   reversal of valuation allowance resulting from the sale of TPI.

(4) Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
  Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus outstanding common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents consist of employee and director stock options, restricted stock awards, other share-based payment awards, and contingently issuable shares related to the Company s   7.0%   Convertible Senior Notes due December 15, 2017 (the "Convertible Notes") and the Company's   5.25%   Convertible Senior Secured Notes due December 30, 2019 (the "New Convertible Notes"), which are included in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding using the treasury stock method, if dilutive. Refer to   Note 7 - Debt   for further description of the Convertible Notes and New Convertible Notes. 
  The following table is a reconciliation of the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share calculations: 

The New Convertible Notes are dilutive to the extent the Company generates net income and the average stock price during the period is greater than   $2.25   per share, which is the conversion price of the New Convertible Notes.The New Convertible Notes are only dilutive for the  in the money  portion of the New Convertible Notes that could be settled with the Company s common stock. In future periods, absent a fundamental change (as defined in the New Convertible Notes indenture), the outstanding New Convertible Notes could increase diluted average shares outstanding by a maximum of approximately   9,900   shares. The Convertible Notes would have an insignificant impact on the diluted average shares outstanding if settled with the Company's stock.

(5) Joint Venture 
  Kreher Steel Company, LLC ("Kreher"), a national distributor and processor of carbon and alloy steel bar products headquartered in Melrose Park, Illinois, was a   50%   owned joint venture of the Company. In August  2016, the Company completed the sale of its ownership share in Kreher to its joint venture partner for aggregate cash proceeds of   $31,550  , which resulted in a loss on disposal of   $5  , including selling expenses. Because the sale of the Company's investment in Kreher is not considered to be a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, the results of Kreher are reflected within continuing operations in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In June 2016, the Company received an offer from its joint venture partner to purchase its ownership share in Kreher for an amount that was less than the current carrying value of the Company's investment in Kreher. The Company determined that the offer to purchase its ownership share in Kreher at a purchase price lower than the carrying value indicated that it may not be able to recover the full carrying amount of its investment, and therefore recognized a   $4,636   other-than-temporary impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016 to reduce the carrying amount of the investment to the negotiated purchase price. Prior to receiving the purchase offer, the Company had no previous indicators that its investment in Kreher had incurred a loss in value that was other-than-temporary.   
  The following information summarizes financial data for this joint venture (for the periods in 2016, the information is through the date the Company sold its investment in Kreher): 

(6) Intangible Assets

Secured Notes 
  In February 2016, the Company completed a private exchange offer and consent solicitation (the  Exchange Offer ) to certain eligible holders to exchange new   12.75%   Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the  New Secured Notes ) for the Company s outstanding   12.75%   Senior Secured Notes due 2016 (the "Secured Notes"). In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Company issued   $203,319   aggregate principal amount of New Secured Notes. In conjunction with the Exchange Offer, the Company solicited consents to certain proposed amendments to the Secured Notes and the related indenture (the  Existing Indenture ) providing for, among other things, elimination of substantially all restrictive covenants and certain events of default in the Existing Indenture and releasing all of the collateral securing the Secured Notes and related guarantees. In May 2016, the Company entered into an agreement providing for the exchange of   $1,200   aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes for   $1,200   aggregate principal amount of New Secured Notes. On August 1, 2016, the Company issued a notice of redemption with respect to the remaining outstanding Secured Notes and deposited   $5,629   with the trustee (representing the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the August 31, 2016 redemption date) to effect a satisfaction and discharge of the indenture governing the Secured Notes. There is   no   principal amount of Secured Notes outstanding at September 30, 2016.  
  The New Secured Notes have substantially the same terms as the Secured Notes except for the following principal differences: (i) the New Secured Notes were offered pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and do not have the benefit of any exchange offer or other registration rights, (ii) the New Secured Notes effectively extend the maturity date of the Secured Notes to December 15, 2018, unless the Company is unable to both (a) complete the exchange of a portion of its Convertible Notes on or prior to June 30, 2016, and (b) redeem, on one or more occasions (each, a  Special Redemption ), an aggregate of not less than   $27,500   of aggregate principal amount of the New Secured Notes on or prior to October 31, 2016, using cash available to the Company and/or net proceeds from sales of assets of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary outside the ordinary course of business (other than net proceeds derived from the sale of accounts receivable and inventory (the  Designated Asset Sale Proceeds )), subject to a penalty equal to   4.00%   of the outstanding principal, payable in cash and/or stock, in the Company s sole discretion (the  Special Redemption Condition ), in which case the maturity date of the New Secured Notes will be   September 14, 2017  , (iii) the New Secured Notes provide that, whether or not the Special Redemption Condition is satisfied, the Company will have an obligation to effect Special Redemptions using Designated Asset Sale Proceeds or other permissible funds until such time as the aggregate amount of Special Redemptions equals   $40,000  , (iv) the New Secured Notes contain modifications to the asset sale covenant providing that the Company shall not use any net proceeds from asset sales outside the ordinary course of business to redeem, repay or prepay the Convertible Notes, and (v) the granting of a third-priority lien on the collateral securing the New Secured Notes for the benefit of the new Convertible Notes is a permitted lien under the indenture. The Company completed the exchange of a portion  
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

of its Convertible Notes prior to June 30, 2016, and satisfied the Special Redemption Condition by issuing an irrevocable notice of redemption for $27,500 of aggregate principal amount of New Secured Notes on October 31, 2016.   
  The New Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain   100%   owned domestic subsidiaries of the Company (the  Guarantors ). The New Secured Notes and the related guarantees are secured by a lien on substantially all of the Company's and the Guarantors' assets, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens pursuant to a pledge and security agreement. The terms of the New Secured Notes contain numerous covenants imposing financial and operating restrictions on the Company's business. These covenants place restrictions on the Company's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things, pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or restricted payments; incur indebtedness or issue common stock; make certain investments; create liens; agree to payment restrictions affecting certain subsidiaries; consolidate or merge; sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets, including equity interests of certain subsidiaries; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and use the proceeds of permitted sales of the Company's assets.  
  The Company may redeem some or all of the New Secured Notes at a redemption price of   100%   of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The New Secured Notes also contain a provision that allows holders of the New Secured Notes to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of the New Secured Notes if a change of control triggering event occurs. Under this provision, the repurchase of the New Secured Notes will occur at a purchase price of   101%   of the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such New Secured Notes to the date of repurchase. In addition, upon certain asset sales, the Company may be required to offer to use the net proceeds thereof to purchase some of the New Secured Notes at   100%   of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
  The New Secured Notes require that the Company make, subject to certain conditions and within   95   days of the end of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, an offer to purchase the New Secured Notes with (i)   75%   of excess cash flow (as defined in the New Secured Notes indenture) until the Company has offered to purchase up to   $50,000   in aggregate principal amount of the notes, (ii)   50%   of excess cash flow until the Company has offered to purchase up to   $75,000   in aggregate principal amount of the notes, (iii)   25%   of the excess cash flow until the Company has offered to purchase up to   $100,000   in aggregate principal amount of the notes and (iv)   0%   thereafter, in each case, at   103%   of the principal amount, thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
  The Company determined that the Exchange Offer was considered to be a troubled debt restructuring within the scope of ASC No. 470-60, "Debt-Troubled Debt Restructurings", as the Company was determined to be experiencing financial difficulties and was granted a concession by the eligible holders. Accordingly, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company has expensed the eligible holder consent fees and related legal and other direct costs of   $7,075   incurred in conjunction with the Exchange Offer in debt restructuring costs in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. There were   no   consent fees or related legal and other direct costs incurred in conjunction with the Exchange Offer for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  The Company pays interest on the New Secured Notes at a rate of   12.75%   per annum in cash semi-annually.  
  Convertible Notes 
  In the first half of 2016, the Company entered into Transaction Support Agreements (as amended, supplemented or modified, the  Support Agreements ) with certain holders (the  Supporting Holders ) of the Convertible Notes. The Support Agreements provided for the terms of exchanges in which the Company agreed to issue new   5.25%   Senior Secured Convertible Notes due 2019 (the  New Convertible Notes ) in exchange for outstanding Convertible Notes (the  Convertible Note Exchange ). For each   $1   principal amount of Convertible Notes validly exchanged in the Convertible Note Exchange, an exchanging holder of Convertible Notes was entitled to receive   $0.7   principal amount of New Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On March 22, 2016, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3, as later amended, to register the resale of the common stock underlying the New Convertible Notes. On May 6, 2016, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders to consider a proposal to approve, as required pursuant to Rule 312 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, the issuance of the Company s common stock upon conversion of the New Convertible Notes. The proposal was approved by the Company s stockholders with the affirmative vote of approximately 73% of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon, which represented approximately 99% of the total votes cast.   
  In May 2016, the Company entered into amendments to the Support Agreements that, among other things, permitted the Supporting Holders to elect to exchange some or all of the Convertible Notes directly into shares of the Company s common stock on the same economic terms as would be applicable had they exchanged their Convertible Notes for New Convertible Notes and then converted those New Convertible Notes into common stock. 
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

Supporting Holders holding   $23,443   in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes exchanged their Convertible Notes for an aggregate of   7,863   shares of the Company s common stock, which had a fair value of   $15,332   at the time of the Convertible Note Exchange. Supporting Holders holding   $34,016   in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes exchanged their Convertible Notes for   $23,806   in aggregate principal amount of New Convertible Notes, which included (i)   $20,866   in aggregate principal amount of New Convertible Notes issued pursuant to exchange agreements between the Company and certain non-affiliate noteholders and (ii)   $2,940   in aggregate principal amount of New Convertible Notes issued pursuant to an exchange agreement with an affiliate of the Company. 
  As further described below, the New Convertible Notes are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder. The Company determined that the conversion option is not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the New Convertible Notes, nor does it meet the criteria to be considered indexed to the Company s common stock. As a result, the Company concluded that the embedded conversion option must  be bifurcated from the New Convertible Notes, separately valued, and accounted for as a derivative liability that partially settled the Convertible Notes. The initial value allocated to the derivative liability was   $11,574  , with a corresponding discount recorded to the New Convertible Notes. During each reporting period, the derivative liability, which is classified in long-term debt, will be marked to fair value through earnings.  
  The Convertible Note Exchange was considered to be a troubled debt restructuring, as the Company was experiencing financial difficulties and was granted a concession by the Supporting Holders. As a result, the Company recognized a loss of   $76   from the Convertible Note Exchange. The loss has been included in debt restructuring loss, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Subsequent to the Convertible Note Exchange,   $1,483   in aggregate principal amount of New Convertible Notes was converted to   713   shares of the Company s common stock. This resulted in a   $589   extinguishment gain from the conversion of the New Convertible Notes and the settlement of a related portion of the derivative liability. The gain has been included in debt restructuring gain (loss), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $22,323   aggregate principal amount of New Convertible Notes outstanding, and the derivative liability had a fair value of   $3,284  .    
  The New Convertible Notes mature on   December 30, 2019  , and bear interest at a rate of   5.25%   per annum, payable semi-annually in cash. The New Convertible Notes are initially convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at any time at a conversion price per share equal to   $2.25   and are subject to adjustment in accordance with the New Convertible Notes indenture. All current and future guarantors of the New Secured Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, and any other material indebtedness of the Company guarantee the New Convertible Notes, subject to certain exceptions. The New Convertible Notes are secured on a  silent  third-priority basis by the same collateral that secures the New Secured Notes. Upon conversion, the Company will pay and/or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company s election, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares. The value of shares of the Company's common stock for purposes of the settlement of the conversion right will be calculated as provided in the indenture, using a 20 trading day observation period. Upon such conversion, the holder shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the "make-whole" premium, payable in the form of cash, shares of the Company's common stock, or a combination of both, at the Company's sole discretion. The value of shares of Company common stock for purposes of calculating the "make-whole" premium will be based on the greater of (i) 130% of the conversion price then in effect and (ii) the volume weighted average price ("VWAP") of such shares for the 20 trading day observation period as provided in the indenture. 
  If the VWAP of the Company's common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which such notice of redemption is provided, the Company shall have the right to redeem any or all of the New Convertible Notes at a price equal to (i) 100.0% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus (ii) the "make-whole" premium. The redemption price can be paid in the form of cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination of both, at the Company's sole discretion. The value of shares of the Company's common stock will be based on the VWAP of such shares for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the date of redemption. Prior to the third trading day prior to the date of any such redemption, any New Convertible Notes called for redemption may be converted by the holder into shares of the Company's common stock at the conversion price then in effect. 
  Following the Convertible Note Exchange, the Company had   $41   aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding at   September 30, 2016  .

Revolving Credit Facility 
  In June 2016, the Company entered into an amendment (the  Amendment ) to the Loan and Security Agreement governing the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ), by and among the Company and certain domestic subsidiaries, the financial institutions from time to time party to the Loan and Security Agreement as lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, in its capacity as agent. The Amendment reduced the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from   $125,000   to   $100,000  , and also decreased aggregate commitments under (i) the Canadian portion of the Revolving Credit Facility from   $20,000   to   $16,000   and (ii) the letter of credit facility portion of the Revolving Credit Facility from   $20,000   to   $16,000  .  
  The Amendment imposed an availability block that decreased availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by   $17,500   initially. The availability block is subject to adjustment, and is reduced to   $8,750   if the Company s ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Loan and Security Agreement) of EBITDA to fixed charges (the  Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio ) is at least 1.0 to 1.0 for each of the preceding six months. It is reduced to   zero   if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is at least 1.0 to 1.0 for any trailing twelve-month period. The availability block was $17,500 as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Previously, the Revolving Credit Facility restricted the Company s ability to repay the New Secured Notes and the Secured Notes unless the Company is able to satisfy certain financial testing conditions. Pursuant to the terms of the  Amendment, the Company is permitted to repay up to   $27,500   of the New Secured Notes and up to   $6,000   of the Secured Notes, subject to satisfaction of revised financial testing conditions. 
  The Amendment also increased the interest rate charged in connection with loans advanced under the Revolving Credit Facility. At the Company s election, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at variable rates based on (a) a customary base rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75% or (b) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75%, with such applicable margins subject to adjustment if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is at least 1.0 to 1.0  . T  he weighted average interest rate for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   4.00%     and   3.40%  , respectively. The Company pays certain customary recurring fees with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility. 
  The Revolving Credit Facility matures on   December 10, 2019   (or 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Company's Secured Notes or Convertible Notes if they have not been refinanced at that time). If certain incurrence tests are met, subject to approval by the Revolving Credit Facility lending group, the Company may have the ability under its Revolving Credit Facility to increase the aggregate commitments by   $25,000   in the future. Currently, the Company is not able to increase the aggregate commitments as it has not met the incurrence tests. 
  The Revolving Credit Facility contains a springing financial maintenance covenant requiring the Company to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of   1.1   to 1.0 when excess availability is less than the greater of   10%   of the calculated borrowing base (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Loan and Security Agreement) or   $10,000  . In addition, if excess availability is less than the greater of   12.5%   of the calculated borrowing base (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Loan and Security Agreement) or   $12,500  , the lender has the right to take full dominion of the Company s cash collections and apply these proceeds to outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was negative for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  . At this ratio, the Company's current maximum borrowing capacity would be   $54,471   before triggering full dominion of the Company's cash collections. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $41,971   of additional unrestricted borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. As noted above, the Company issued an irrevocable notice of redemption for $27,500 of aggregate principal amount of New Secured Notes on October 31, 2016. The Company will use proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility to make the redemption payment.

(8) Fair Value Measurements 
  The three-tier value hierarchy the Company utilizes, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies, is: 
  Level 1   Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 
  Level 2   Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
  Level 3   Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. 
  The fair value of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values. The fair value of cash equivalents are determined using the fair value hierarchy described above. Cash equivalents consisting of money market funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and as a result are classified as Level 1.  
  The Company s pension plan asset portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is primarily invested in fixed income securities, which generally fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Fixed income securities are valued based on evaluated prices provided to the trustee by independent pricing services. Such prices may be determined by various factors which include, but are not limited to, market quotations, yields, maturities, call features, ratings, institutional size trading in similar groups of securities and developments related to specific securities.   
  Fair Value Measurements of Debt 
  The fair value of the Company's New Secured Notes as of   September 30, 2016   was estimated to be   $153,901   compared to a carrying value of   $204,519  . The fair value of the Company's Secured Notes as of   December 31, 2015   was estimated to be   $160,662   compared to a carrying value of   $210,000  . The fair values for both the Secured Notes and New Secured Notes were determined based on recent trades of the bonds and fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  The fair value of the Company's Convertible Notes as of   September 30, 2016   was estimated to be   $25   compared to a carrying value of   $41  . The fair value of the Convertible Notes as of   December 31, 2015   was approximately   $21,966   compared to a carrying value of   $57,500  . The fair value of the Company's New Convertible Notes as of   September 30, 2016  , including the bifurcated embedded conversion option, was estimated to be   $8,233   compared to a carrying value of   $22,323  . The fair values for both the Convertible Notes and New Convertible Notes, which fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, were determined based on similar debt instruments that do not contain a conversion feature, as well as other factors related to the callable nature of the Convertible Notes and New Convertible Notes.    
  The main inputs and assumptions into the fair value model for the New Convertible Notes at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

Given the revolving nature and the variable interest rates, the Company has determined that the fair value of the Revolving Credit Facility approximates its carrying value.

Fair Value Measurements of Embedded Conversion Feature 
  The fair value of the derivative liability for the embedded conversion feature of the New Convertible Notes was estimated to be   $3,284   as of   September 30, 2016  . The estimated fair value of the derivative liability for the embedded conversion feature of the New Convertible Notes, which falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, is measured on a recurring basis using a binomial lattice model using the Company's historical volatility over the term corresponding to the remaining contractual term of the New Convertible Notes and observed spreads of similar debt instruments that do not include a conversion feature. The following reconciliation represents the change in fair value of the embedded conversion feature of the New Convertible Notes between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  : 

(a)    Mark-to-market adjustment is recognized in unrealized gain on embedded debt conversion option in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Fair Value Measurements of Commodity Hedges 
  The Company has a commodity hedging program to mitigate risks associated with certain commodity price fluctuations. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had executed forward contracts that extend through 2016. The counterparty to these contracts is not considered a credit risk by the Company. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the notional value associated with forward contracts was   $770   and   $3,080  , respectively. The Company recorded, through cost of materials, realized and unrealized net losses of   $3   for the three months ended September 30, 2016, realized and unrealized net gains of   $31   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , and realized and unrealized net losses of   $252   and   $706   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , all commodity hedge contracts were in a liability position. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a letter of credit outstanding for   $700   as collateral for the commodity hedge contracts. 
  The Company uses information which is representative of readily observable market data when valuing derivative liabilities associated with commodity hedges.  
  The liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows: 

(a)    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the entire derivative liability for commodity hedges of   $202   and   $1,015  , respectively, are short-term and are included in accrued and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

  Convertible Note Exchange and Conversions of New Convertible Notes 
  The Company issued   7,863   shares of common stock in May 2016 in connection with the Convertible Note Exchange, and issued an additional   713   shares in June 2016 when New Convertible Notes were converted to common stock. The issuance of these shares was recorded using the fair value of the Company's common stock on the dates the shares were issued, and resulted in an increase in the par value of common stock and additional paid-in capital of   $86   and   $16,543  , respectively. The Company received no cash proceeds from issuing these shares.   
  Accumulated Comprehensive Loss

   (b)    These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are included in the computation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost included in sales, general and administrative expense. Prior service cost of   $813   for pension curtailment is shown as restructuring expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . There was   no   pension curtailment expense in the three and   nine months ended September 30,   2016 or the   three months ended September 30,   2015.  

(10) Share-based Compensation  
  The Company accounts for its share-based compensation arrangements by recognizing compensation expense for the fair value of the share awards granted ratably over their vesting period. All compensation expense related to share-based compensation arrangements is recorded in sales, general and administrative expense and warehouse, processing and delivery expense. The total share-based compensation expense recognized for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $350   and   $916  , respectively, and   $428   and   $424   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. The unrecognized compensation cost as of   September 30, 2016   associated with all share-based payment arrangements is   $2,087   and the weighted average period over which it is to be expensed is   1.3 years  .  
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company granted   304   non-vested shares to its non-employee directors pursuant to the Company's Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan. The non-vested shares had a weighted average grant date fair value of   $1.47   per share. The grant date fair value of the non-vested shares is established using the market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. The non-vested shares vest in full on the first anniversary of the date of grant.  
  On February 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the grant of   1,203   non-qualified stock options ("stock options") for executive officers under the Company s 2016 Long-Term Compensation Plan ( 2016 LTC Plan ). All stock options awarded under the 2016 LTC Plan are subject to the terms of the 2008 A.M. Castle   Co. Omnibus Incentive Plan, amended and restated as of July 27, 2016. 
  The stock options vest in three equal installments over three years from the grant date and are exercisable immediately upon vesting. The strike price was equal to the closing price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. The term of the options is   10   years from the date of grant. 
  The weighted average grant date fair value of   $1.12   per share for the options granted under the 2016 LTC Plan for executive officers was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

  (12) Restructuring Activity 
  In April 2015, the Company announced a restructuring plan consisting of workforce reductions and the consolidation of more facilities in locations deemed to have redundant operations. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred additional costs associated with the April 2015 restructuring plan which consisted of employee termination and related benefits, moving costs, professional fees and losses on the disposal of fixed assets. In addition, the Company recorded charges of   $452   for inventory moved from consolidated plants that was subsequently identified to be scrapped. The inventory charge is reported in cost of materials in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Substantially all of the previously  announced restructuring activities are complete. 
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company closed its Houston and Edmonton facilities and sold all the equipment at these facilities to an unrelated third party. Restructuring activities associated with the strategic decision to close these facilities included employee termination and related benefits, lease termination costs, moving costs associated with exit from the closed facilities, and professional fees at the closed facilities.  
  As a result of its restructuring activities, the Company incurred the following restructuring expenses:

     Table of Contents  

Restructuring reserve activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is summarized below: 

(a)    As of   September 30, 2016  , the short-term portion of employee termination and related benefits of   $100   is included in accrued and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and the long-term portion associated with the Company's withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan of   $5,500   is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
   (b)    Payments on certain of the lease obligations are scheduled to continue until 2020. Market conditions and the Company s ability to sublease these properties could affect the ultimate charge related to the lease obligations. Any potential recoveries or additional charges could affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements of future periods. As of   September 30, 2016  , the short-term portion of the lease termination costs of   $125   is included in accrued and other current liabilities and the long-term portion of the lease termination costs of   $1,708   is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
   (c)    In connection with the closure of the Company's Houston and Edmonton facilities, the Company agreed to sell its fixed assets and to a reduction in future proceeds from the sale of inventory in exchange for the assignment of its remaining lease obligations at its Houston facility resulting in a non-cash charge of   $4,539   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
   
  (13) Income Taxes  
  The Company's tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. The Company s effective tax rate is expressed as income tax (benefit) expense, which includes tax expense on the Company s share of joint venture losses, as a percentage of loss from continuing operations before     income taxes and equity in losses of joint venture. 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded income tax expense of   $903   on pre-tax loss from continuing operations before equity in losses of joint venture of   $17,359  , for an effective tax rate of   (5.2)%  .  For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded income tax benefit of   $629   on pre-tax loss from continuing operations before equity in losses of joint venture of   $27,941  , for an effective tax rate of   2.3%  . 
  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded income tax expense of   $1,099   on pre-tax loss from continuing operations before equity in losses of joint venture of   $79,096  , for an effective tax rate of   (1.4)%  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded income tax benefit of   $22,141   on pre-tax loss from continuing operations before equity in losses of joint venture of   $113,536  , for an effective tax rate of   19.5%  .  
  The Company's U.S. statutory rate is   35%  . The most significant factors impacting the effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were losses in jurisdictions that the Company is not able to benefit due to uncertainty as to the realization of those losses and the impact of intraperiod allocations. 
   
  (14) Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $8,088   of irrevocable letters of credit outstanding which primarily consisted of   $5,000   for its warehouse in Janesville, Wisconsin,   $700   for collateral associated with commodity hedges and   $1,288   for compliance with the insurance reserve requirements of its workers  compensation insurance program. 
  The Company is party to a variety of legal proceedings and other claims, including proceedings by government authorities, which arise from the operation of its business. These proceedings are incidental and occur in the normal course of the Company's business affairs. The majority of these claims and proceedings relate to commercial disputes with customers, suppliers, and others; employment, including benefit matters; product quality; and environmental, health and safety claims.  It is the opinion of management that the currently expected outcome of these proceedings and claims, after taking into account recorded accruals and the availability and limits of our insurance coverage, will

not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the Company. 
   
  (15) Subsequent Events 
  Special Redemption of Senior Secured Notes 
  On October 31, 2016, the Company issued an irrevocable notice of redemption with respect to   $27,500   aggregate principal amount of its New Secured Notes. These New Secured Notes were redeemed on November 9, 2016, meeting the Special Redemption Condition set forth in the indenture governing the New Secured Notes. 
  Commitment for Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities 
  On November 1, 2016, and November 2, 2016, the Company entered into commitment letters with certain financial institutions in order to replace and repay any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, including cash collateralization of any undrawn letters of credit, and to provide access to additional working capital. Pursuant to the terms of the commitment letters, the new credit facilities will take the form of senior secured term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of   $100,000  . In connection therewith, commitments pursuant the Revolving Credit Facility will be terminated and liens granted to the collateral agent pursuant thereto will be released in full. The funding of the term loan facilities is subject to original issue discount in an amount equal to   3.0%   of the full principal amount of the facilities. The facilities will bear interest at a rate of   11.0%   per annum, and will mature in September 2018. The Company will be subject to certain financial covenants, consisting of (a) a minimum cash EBITDA level, (b) a minimum liquidity amount, and (c) a minimum working capital covenant.  
  Upon initial funding of the term loan facilities, the financial institutions will be issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of   5,000   shares of common stock of the Company, pro rata based on the principal amount of each financial institution s commitment.  The warrants will have exercise prices as follows: (a) 50% of the warrants will have an exercise price of   $0.50   per share and will expire 18 months from the date of grant and (ii) the remaining 50% of the warrants will have an exercise price of   $0.65   per share and will expire 18 months from the date of the grant. 
  A definitive agreement with respect to the term loan facilities, as required by the commitment letters, has not been executed and there can be no assurances that such agreement will be executed or as to the terms of such facilities, or that certain other conditions required by the commitment letters will be satisfied. 
  Shareholder Sale and Purchase of Company Common Stock 
  On November 3, 2016, one of the Company's shareholders, W. B.   Co., purchased all   4,631   shares of the Company's common stock owned by Raging Capital Master Fund, Ltd. 
  The future utilization of the Company's federal and state net operating losses is expected to be limited by Internal Revenue Service Section 382 due to this ownership change and others that occurred since the last ownership change that occurred in 2015. The impact of this limitation has not been quantified at this time; however, the Company has a full valuation allowance against its federal and state net operating losses.

  In February 2016, the Company sold all of its inventory at its Houston and Edmonton facilities, which primarily serviced the energy market, to an unrelated third party and recognized net sales and cost of materials of $27.1 million. Subsequently, the Company sold all of its equipment at its Houston and Edmonton facilities and agreed to a reduction in future proceeds from the inventory sale in exchange for the assignment of its remaining lease obligations at its Houston facility, resulting in a non-cash charge of $4.5 million. The Company ceased operations at the Houston and Edmonton facilities in February 2016 and recorded restructuring expense of $7.5 million related to the closure of these facilities (including the previously discussed $4.5 million non-cash loss) in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The sale of the assets and subsequent closure of the Houston and Edmonton facilities did not qualify as a discontinued operation under the authoritative accounting guidance. 
  On March 15, 2016, the Company completed the sale of substantially all the assets of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Total Plastics, Inc. ("TPI"), for $53.6 million in cash. The Company used the proceeds of the sale to repay indebtedness, pursuant to its previously announced plan to improve its capital structure. The sale of TPI, which resulted in pre-tax and after-tax gains of   $2.0 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively, allows the Company to focus solely on its core metals business going forward. TPI is reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as a discontinued operation, and all the financial data in this filing has been recast to present TPI as a discontinued operation retrospectively for all periods presented. 
  In June 2016, the Company received an offer from its joint venture partner to purchase its ownership share in Kreher Steel Company, LLC ("Kreher") for an amount that was less than the current carrying value of the Company's investment in Kreher. The Company determined that this offer indicated that the Company may not be able to recover the full carrying amount of its investment and therefore, the Company recognized a   $4.6 million   other-than-temporary impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016 to reduce the carrying amount of the investment to the negotiated purchase price. In August 2016, the Company completed the sale of its ownership share in Kreher to its joint venture partner for aggregate cash proceeds of   $31.6 million  , which resulted in an insignificant loss on disposal. Because the sale of the Company's investment in Kreher is not considered to be a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, the results of Kreher through the date of sale are reflected within continuing operations in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  In the first half of 2016, the Company exchanged $204.5 million aggregate principal amount of 12.75% Senior Secured Notes due December 2016 for $204.5 million aggregate principal amount of new 12.75% Senior Secured Notes due December 2018. The Company also exchanged $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of 7.0% Convertible Notes due December 2017 for a combination of $23.8 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Convertible Notes due December 2019 and 7.9 million shares of the Company's common stock. These actions extended the maturity of substantially all of the Company's Senior Secured Notes and Convertible Notes on terms that greatly improved the Company's capital structure.

Results of Operations:   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  The following table sets forth certain statement of operations data for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Included in the operating results below is the closure of the Company's Houston and Edmonton facilities which occurred in the first quarter of 2016. 

(a)    Operating costs and expenses include   $0.9 million   and   $1.2 million   of restructuring expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Net Sales 
  Net sales in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $124.9 million  , a decrease of   $25.7 million  , or   17.1%  , compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in net sales was mainly due to a   9.6%   decrease in tons sold per day to customers compared to the same period in the prior year, coupled with a   4.4%   decrease in average selling prices. Impacting the decrease in net tons sold per day were sales attributable to the Company's Houston and Edmonton operations which were closed in February 2016. Excluding the tons sold from the Houston and Edmonton operations in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , tons sold per day decreased 3.6% in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The largest sales volume decreases in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   were in alloy bar, SBQ bar, tubing products, and cold finished carbon, with sales volume increases in aluminum and carbon and alloy plate.  
  Downward pricing pressures resulting from historically high levels of foreign imports into the U.S. market, lower prices on products purchased from mills and inventory de-stocking practices by many competitors continue to have a negative impact on metals pricing. The Company posted a decrease in the price per ton sold of virtually all of its product categories as compared to the prior year quarter. An overall favorable product mix in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   partly offset the impact of the decrease in selling prices.  
  Cost of Materials 
  Cost of materials (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $92.4 million   compared to   $115.3 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   $22.9 million  , or   19.9%  , decrease is largely due to the decrease in sales volume in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Cost of materials (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was   74.0%   of net sales in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   76.6%   of net sales in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .

Operating Costs and Expenses and Operating Loss 
  Operating costs and expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Operating costs and expenses decreased by   $9.7 million   from   $50.8 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $41.1 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  
             
    Warehouse, processing and delivery expense decreased by   $6.3 million   mainly as a result of lower payroll and benefits costs, lower variable costs resulting from the decrease in sales activity as well as lower facility costs resulting from plant consolidations and the February 2016 closure of the Houston and Edmonton facilities; 
                
    Sales, general and administrative expense decreased by   $1.2 million   mainly as a result of lower payroll and benefits costs due to lower company-wide employee headcount, bad debt expense and outside consulting services, partly offset by higher incentive based compensation costs; 
                
    Restructuring expense of   $0.9 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   consisted mainly of professional fees and severance expense; and 
                
    Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by   $1.9 million   mainly as a result of the impairment of intangible assets recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as plant consolidations and closures, and equipment sales. 
     Operating loss in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , including restructuring expense of   $0.9 million  , was   $8.6 million   compared to operating loss of   $15.5 million  , including   $1.2 million   of restructuring expense, in the same period last year.   
  Other Income and Expense, Income Taxes and Net Loss 
  Interest expense was   $8.7 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $10.2 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily attributable to lower outstanding borrowings. Unrealized gain on the embedded conversion option associated with the 5.25% Convertible Notes due December 30, 2019 was   $6.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . There was no conversion option associated with the convertible debt requiring mark-to-market accounting in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Other expense, comprised mostly of foreign currency transaction losses, was   $6.3 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.3 million   in the same period last year. The unfavorable change in these transaction losses from the prior year period was partly related to unhedged intercompany financing arrangements.  
  The Company recorded an income tax expense of   $0.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to an income tax benefit of   $0.6 million   for the same period last year. The Company s effective tax rate is expressed as income tax (benefit) expense, which includes tax expense on the Company s share of joint venture losses, as a percentage of loss from continuing operations before     income taxes and equity in losses of joint venture. The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   (5.2)%   and   2.3%  , respectively. The higher effective tax rate in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   resulted from changes in the geographic mix and timing of income (losses), the inability to benefit from current year losses due to changes in valuation allowances positions in the U.S. and Canada, and the impact of intraperiod allocations. 
  In August  2016, the Company completed the sale of its interest in its joint venture for aggregate cash proceeds of   $31.6 million  . Equity in losses of joint venture in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was less than $0.1 million   (refer to     Note 5 - Joint Venture     to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  ).     Equity in losses of the Company s joint venture was   $1.5 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , which included a   $1.8 million   charge associated with the impairment of goodwill at the joint venture.

Loss from continuing operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $18.3 million   compared to a loss from continuing operations of   $28.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was   $1.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , which resulted from the settlement of the final working capital of TPI. Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was   $1.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  Net loss for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $20.0 million  . Net loss for the same period in the prior year, which includes income from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) of   $1.0 million  , was   $27.8 million  . 

Results of Operations:   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  The following table sets forth certain statement of operations data for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Included in the operating results below is the sale of all inventory and subsequent closure of the Company's Houston and Edmonton facilities which occurred in the first quarter of 2016. 

(a)    Cost of materials includes   $0.5 million   and $22.3 million of inventory scrapping expenses associated with restructuring activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   (b)    Operating costs and expenses include   $14.7 million   and   $17.7 million   of restructuring expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Also included in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was a $5.6 million gain from the sale of an operating facility. 
  Net Sales 
  Net sales in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $419.4 million  , a decrease of   $86.0 million  , or   17.0%  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in net sales was mainly attributable to a   15.6%   decrease in tons sold per day to customers compared to the same period in the prior year and a   6.8%   decrease in average selling prices, offset by a favorable product mix and the impact of the Company's $27.1 million sale of all its inventory at its Houston and Edmonton facilities to an unrelated third party in the first quarter of 2016. The sale of this inventory, which was sold at a zero gross profit margin, was the result of a strategic decision to lower the Company's exposure to oil and gas market fluctuations.  
  Compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , sales volumes in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased on virtually all products, with tubing, SBQ bar and alloy bar products having the most significant declines in sales volumes in the period. The closure of the Company's Houston and Edmonton facilities in February 2016 also led to decreased sales volume as the tons sold from these locations, which primarily were sold to oil and gas customers, were not replaced by subsequent sales out of another of the Company's service centers.  
  Downward pricing pressures in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   resulted in lower average selling prices on all of the products the Company sells compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Lower pricing on high volumes of foreign metal imports and de-stocking by many of the Company's competitors caused the Company to lower prices in order to remain competitive. The most significant average selling price decreases of 8% to 18% on many of the Company's highest selling products by volume drove the   6.8%   decrease in average selling prices in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   with a partial offset from favorable product mix.

Cost of Materials 
  Cost of materials (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $323.8 million   compared to   $411.8 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   $88.0 million  , or   21.4%  , decrease is largely due to the decrease in sales volume during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , partly offset by the $27.1 million of cost of materials recognized on the sale of all inventory at the Company's Houston and Edmonton facilities in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as discussed above. Included in cost of materials in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   is a $22.3 million restructuring charge related to the write-down of aged and excess inventory compared to a restructuring charge of   $0.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Cost of materials (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was   77.2%   as a percent of net sales in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   81.5%   as a percent of net sales for the comparative prior year period.  
  Operating Costs and Expenses and Operating Loss 
  Operating costs and expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Operating costs and expenses decreased by   $29.9 million   from   $172.3 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $142.4 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
             
    Warehouse, processing and delivery expense, excluding a gain on sale of facility of $5.6 million recorded during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , decreased by   $18.7 million   as a result of lower payroll and benefits costs, lower variable costs resulting from the decrease in sales activity, and lower facility costs resulting from plant consolidations and the February 2016 closure of the Houston and Edmonton facilities; 
                
    Sales, general and administrative expense decreased by   $8.8 million   mainly as a result of lower payroll and benefits costs and non-restructuring related executive severance costs incurred in the prior year period; 
                
    Restructuring expense of   $14.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   consisted mainly of lease termination charges associated with the closure of the Company's Houston and Edmonton facilities, as well as moving expenses associated with the plant consolidations related to the April 2015 restructuring plan; and 
                
    Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by   $5.0 million   mainly as a result of the impairment of intangible assets recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as plant consolidations and closures, and equipment sales.   
     Operating loss in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , including restructuring charges of   $14.7 million   and inventory scrapping expense associated with restructuring activities of   $0.5 million  , was   $46.8 million   compared to an operating loss of   $78.7 million  , including restructuring-related inventory scrapping expense of $22.3 million, restructuring charges of   $17.7 million   and the $5.6 million gain on sale of facility, in the same period in the prior year.

Other Income and Expense, Income Taxes and Net Loss  
  Interest expense was   $28.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $30.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Unrealized gain on the embedded conversion option associated with the 5.25% Convertible Notes due December 30, 2019 was   $7.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . There was no conversion option associated with the convertible debt requiring mark-to-market accounting in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Debt restructuring costs of   $6.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflect $7.1 million of eligible holder consent fees and related legal and other direct costs   incurred in conjunction with the Exchange Offer, partly offset by a     $0.5 million     gain resulting from the Convertible Note Exchange and the subsequent conversion of      New Convertible Notes to equity.  
  Other expense, comprised mostly of foreign currency transaction losses, was   $4.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $4.5 million   for the same period in the prior year. These losses are primarily related to unhedged intercompany financing arrangements.  
  The Company recorded an income tax expense of   $1.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to an income tax benefit of   $22.1 million   for the same period last year. The Company s effective tax rate is expressed as income tax (benefit) expense, which includes tax expense on the Company s share of joint venture losses, as a percentage of loss from continuing operations before     income taxes and equity in losses of joint venture. The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   (1.4)%   and   19.5%  , respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   resulted from changes in the geographic mix and timing of income (losses), the inability to benefit from current year losses due to changes in valuation allowance positions in the U.S. and Canada, and the impact of intraperiod allocations. 
  Equity in losses of the Company s joint venture was   $4.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to equity in losses of joint venture of   $0.1 million   in the same period last year. In August  2016, the Company completed the sale of its joint venture for aggregate cash proceeds of   $31.6 million  . Included in the equity in losses of the Company's joint venture in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was an impairment charge of   $4.6 million   re  lated to the write-down of the Company's investment in joint venture to fair value (refer to     Note 5 - Joint Venture     to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  ). Equity in losses of joint venture for the prior year period included   a   $1.8 million   charge associated with the impairment of goodwill at the joint venture.      
  Loss from continuing operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $84.4 million   compared to a loss from continuing operations of   $91.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was   $6.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, of   $2.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   includes an after-tax gain on the sale of TPI of   $1.3 million   and an income tax benefit of   $4.2 million   from the reversal of an income tax valuation allowance. 
  Net loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which includes income from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) of   $6.2 million  , was   $78.1 million  . Net loss for the same period in the prior year, which includes income from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) of   $2.3 million  , was   $89.2 million  . 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Cash and cash equivalents increased (decreased) as follows: 

29 

     Table of Contents  

The Company s principal sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and available revolver borrowing capacity to fund working capital needs and growth initiatives. Specific components of the change in working capital are highlighted below: 
              
    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , lower inventory levels compared to year-end   2015   provided   $34.8 million   of cash flow source, while lower inventory levels at September 30, 2015 compared to year-end 2014 were a   $43.8 million   cash flow source for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The majority of the cash flow source from inventory in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was the result of the Houston and Edmonton inventory sale discussed above.  Average days sales in inventory was   172.7   days for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   228.0   days for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which resulted primarily from the Houston and Edmonton inventory sale and improved inventory management. 
                
    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , increases in accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities were a   $14.6 million   cash flow source compared to a   $22.9 million   cash flow source for the same period last year. Accounts payable days outstanding was   44.5   days for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   43.7   days for the same period last year.  
     Net cash from investing activities of   $85.5 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is mainly attributable to cash proceeds from the sale of TPI and the sale of the Company's 50% ownership in Kreher. Cash paid for capital expenditures for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $2.4 million  , a decrease of   $2.1 million   from the same period last year. Management expects capital expenditures to range from $3.0 million to $4.0 million for the full-year   2016  . 
  All available proceeds from the sale of TPI and Kreher were used to pay down the Company's long-term debt, which along with the $8.7 million payment of debt restructuring costs, resulted in net cash used in financing activities of   $68.7 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  In connection with the Exchange Offer completed in February 2016 and subsequent secured note exchanges, the Company issued $204.5 million aggregate principal amount of New Secured Notes. On August 1, 2016, the Company issued a notice of redemption with respect to the remaining outstanding Secured Notes and deposited $5.6 million with the trustee (representing the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the August 31, 2016 redemption date) to effect a satisfaction and discharge of the indenture governing the Secured Notes.    
  The Company also completed the Convertible Note Exchange during the first half of 2016. Supporting Holders holding $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes exchanged their Convertible Notes for an aggregate of 7.9 million shares of the Company's common stock and $23.8 million aggregate principal amount of New Convertible Notes.  
  In June 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to its Revolving Credit Facility that reduced the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from   $125,000   to $100,000. The amendment also imposed an availability block that decreased availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by $17,500 initially. The availability block is subject to reduction if the Company s ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Loan and Security Agreement) of EBITDA to fixed charges (the  Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio ) is at least 1.0 to 1.0 for certain specified periods. As a result of these items, along with the sale of certain assets, the Company's current maximum borrowing capacity has decreased from $96.2 million at December 31, 2015 to   $54.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Under the Revolving Credit Facility Loan and Security Agreement, the maximum borrowing capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility is based on the Company's borrowing base calculation. The weighted average advance rates used in the borrowing base calculation are 85.0% on eligible accounts receivable and 55.2% on eligible inventory. 
  The Company's Revolving Credit Facility contains a springing financial maintenance covenant requiring the Company to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.1 to 1.0 when excess availability is less than the greater of   10%   of the calculated borrowing base (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Loan and Security Agreement) or   $10 million  . In addition, if excess availability is less than the greater of   12.5%   of the calculated borrowing base (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Loan and Security Agreement) or   $12.5 million  , the lender has the right to take full

dominion of the Company s cash collections and apply these proceeds to outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement ( Cash Dominion ). The Company's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was negative for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  . At this ratio, the Company's current maximum borrowing capacity would be   $54.5 million   before triggering Cash Dominion. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on December 10, 2019 (or 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Company's Secured Notes or Convertible Notes if they have not been refinanced at that time). 
  Additional unrestricted borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility at   September 30, 2016   was as follows:

As part of the Company's refinancing of its Secured Notes, it agreed to make Special Redemptions using Designated Asset Sales Proceeds (refer to   Note 7 - Debt   to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Pursuant to the indenture governing the New Secured Notes, Special Redemptions of not less than $27.5 million of aggregate principal amount of the New Secured Notes must be made on or prior to October 31, 2016, subject to a penalty equal to 4.0% of the outstanding principal, payable in cash and/or stock, in which case the maturity date of the New Secured Notes will be September 14, 2017. On October 31, 2016, the Company issued an irrevocable notice of redemption for $27.5 million of aggregate principal amount of the New Secured Notes to satisfy the Special Redemption requirement. The Company will use proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility to make the Special Redemption payment, which will have a corresponding decrease in the Company's unrestricted borrowing capacity.  
  The Revolving Credit Facility matures on December 10, 2019 (or 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Company's Secured Notes or Convertible Notes if they have not been refinanced at that time). 
  The Company currently expects that it will have sufficient access to cash flows to continue as a going concern, to fund its ongoing capital expenditure programs and meet its debt obligations, including interest payments, for at least the next twelve months. However, these plans rely on certain underlying assumptions and estimates that may differ from actual results. Such assumptions include improvements in operating results and cash flows driven by ongoing refinancing efforts and the restructuring activities taken that streamlined the Company s organizational structure, lowered operating costs and increased liquidity. These plans also rely on the Company securing additional financing, achieving its sales targets, continuing to reduce operating costs and managing its working capital to increase liquidity. If the Company s efforts to manage working capital and improve operating results are not successful, the Company may not have sufficient cash flows to continue as a going concern. 
  With the completion of the Exchange Offer and Convertible Notes Exchange, the Company has extended the maturity of a substantial portion of its long-term debt for up to two years. The sale of TPI, the sale of the Company's ownership in Kreher, and the sale of the Company's Houston and Edmonton inventory provided liquidity which was used to pay down long-term debt and resulted in a   $53.6 million   reduction in the Company's revolver balance during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The Company plans to further improve liquidity through continued reductions in inventory, ongoing refinancing efforts and possible future strategic sales of under-performing assets. Furthermore, the Company has available borrowing capacity under the asset-based Revolving Credit Facility, as described above.  
  Through its ongoing restructuring and refinancing efforts, the Company is committed to achieving a strong financial position while maintaining sufficient levels of available liquidity, managing working capital and monitoring the Company's overall capitalization. Cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   were   $10.0 million  , and the Company had   $42.0 million   of additional unrestricted borrowing capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility prior to the reduction for the Special Redemption payment of $27.5 million. Approximately   $1.7 million   of the Company s consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance resides in the United States. As foreign earnings are permanently reinvested, availability under the Company s Revolving Credit Facility would be used to fund operations in the United States as the need arises in the future.

Working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, and the balances of its significant components are as follows: 

The Company monitors its overall capitalization by evaluating total debt to total capitalization. Total debt to total capitalization is defined as the sum of short-term and long-term debt, divided by the sum of total debt and stockholders  equity. Total debt to total capitalization was   105.7%   at   September 30, 2016   and   87.1%   at   December 31, 2015  . Over the long-term, the Company plans to improve its total debt to total capitalization by improving operating results, managing working capital and using cash generated from operations as well as the strategic sale of under-performing assets to repay outstanding debt. As and when permitted by the terms of the agreements governing the Company's outstanding indebtedness, depending on market conditions, the Company may decide in the future to refinance, redeem or repurchase its debt and take other steps to reduce its debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve its overall financial position and balance sheet. 
  The Company s principal payments on long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, required during the next five years and thereafter are summarized below:  

(a)    Amount includes Special Redemption payment of   $27.5 million   of aggregate principal amount of the New Secured Notes. The terms of the New Secured Notes require, among other things, a notice of redemption with respect to this Special Redemption to be issued on or prior to October 31, 2016, in order to extend the maturity date of the New Secured Notes to December 15, 2018. On October 31, 2016, the Company issued an irrevocable notice of redemption for $27.5 million of aggregate principal amount of the New Secured Notes to satisfy the Special Redemption Condition. Refer to   Note 7 - Debt   to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
   (b)    Amount includes outstanding balance of   $12.5 million   under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016   which can fluctuate. The maturity date presented above is based on the December 15, 2019 maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility may become due sooner than the December 15, 2019 maturity date as described in   Note 7 - Debt   to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $8.1 million   of irrevocable letters of credit outstanding, which primarily consisted of   $5.0 million   for its new warehouse in Janesville, Wisconsin,   $0.7 million   for collateral associated with commodity hedges and   $1.3 million   for compliance with the insurance reserve requirements of its workers  compensation insurance program. 
  On November 1, 2016, and November 2, 2016, the Company entered into commitment letters with certain financial institutions in order to replace and repay any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, including cash collateralization of any undrawn letters of credit, and to provide access to additional working capital. Pursuant to the terms of the commitment letters, the new credit facilities will take the form of senior secured term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million. Commitments pursuant to the existing Revolving Credit Facility will be terminated, and liens granted to the collateral agent will be released in full. The funding of the term loan facilities is subject to original issue discount in an amount equal to 3.0% of the full principal amount of the facilities. The facilities will bear interest at a rate of 11.0% per annum, and will mature in September 2018. The commitment letters also allow the Company to secure up to $12.0 million of financing through its foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain conditions. The Company expects to close on the term loan facilities in the fourth quarter of 2016.

As noted above, the availability block and other restrictions significantly reduce the Company s unrestricted borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. The term loan facilities are expected to provide the Company with greater liquidity than the Revolving Credit Facility that they will replace. The Company will be subject to certain financial covenants, consisting of (a) a minimum cash EBITDA level, (b) a minimum liquidity amount, and (c) a minimum working capital covenant.  
  A definitive agreement with respect to the term loan facilities, as required by the commitment letters, has not been executed and there can be no assurances that such agreement will be executed or as to the terms of such facilities, or that certain other conditions required by the commitment letters will be satisfied. 
  On October 19, 2016, the Company received written notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the  NYSE ) that it was not in compliance with the continued listing standards set forth in Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The Company was considered below criteria established by the NYSE for continued listing because the average closing price of its common stock was less than $1.00 per share over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. 
    
  In accordance with applicable NYSE procedures, the Company notified the NYSE of its intention to cure this noncompliance.  In accordance with the NYSE rules, the Company has six months from the date of receipt of the notice to achieve compliance with the continued listing standards of Section 802.01C. The Company can regain compliance at any time during the six-month cure period if the Company s common stock has a closing share price of at least $1.00 per share on the last trading day of any calendar month during the period and also has an average closing share price of at least $1.00 per share over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. 
  As previously disclosed, the Company received written notice from the NYSE on January 21, 2016 that it was not in compliance with the continued listing standards related to the maintenance of a minimum level of stockholders' equity and average market capitalization as set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The Company is currently implementing its plan to return to conformity with the relevant standards required in Section 802.01B within the 18-month period allowed by the NYSE.   
  The Company is actively monitoring the price of its common stock and will consider available options to resolve the deficiency and achieve compliance with Rule 802.01C. The Company's common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the cure period, subject to compliance with the NYSE's other applicable continued listing standards.  
   
           Item 3.  
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
     The Company is exposed to interest rate, commodity price and foreign exchange rate risks that arise in the normal course of business. There have been no significant or material changes to such risks since   December 31, 2015  . Refer to Item 7a in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as amended, for further discussion of such risks. 
   
           Item 4.  
    Controls and Procedures 
     (a)   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  A review and evaluation was performed by the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that review and evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
