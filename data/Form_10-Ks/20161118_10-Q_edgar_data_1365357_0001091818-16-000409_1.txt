  3.   Going concern   
   
 The financial statements at September 30, 2016, at Dec 31, 2015 and for the period from April 15, 2011 (date of inception), to September 30, 2016, have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  The Company incurred an accumulated loss of $1,717,792 for the period from April 15, 2011 (date of inception), to September 30, 2016. It has not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we begin selling inventoried products. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
 Management s plans to support the Company in operation and to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public and private offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation.  If we do not raise all of the money we need from a public offering, we will have to find alternative sources, such as a private placement of securities, or loans from our officers, directors or others.  If we require additional cash and can t raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until the cash is raised, or cease business entirely. 
   
 The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  4.   Summary of significant accounting policies   
   
   Basis of presentation and consolidation   
   
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in this report reflect all adjustments that are normal and recurring in nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. These unaudited, consolidated financial statements, footnote disclosures and other information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Group and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the years are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal. 
    
 The Company has limited operations and is considered to be in the development stage under ASC 915-15.

  4.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)   
   
   Use of estimates   
   
 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
   Concentrations of credit risk   
   
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. In respect of accounts receivable, the Group extends credit based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral or other security. In order to minimize the credit risk, the management of the Group has delegated a team responsibility for determination of credit limits, credit approvals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue debts. Further, the Group reviews the recoverable amount of each individual trade debt at each balance sheet date to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made for irrecoverable amounts. In this regard, the directors of the Group consider that the Group s credit risk is significantly reduced. 
   
   Cash and cash equivalents   
   
 Cash and cash equivalents include all cash, deposits in banks and other highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less. 
   
   Revenue recognition   
   
 The Group recognizes revenue when it is earned and realizable based on the following criteria: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. 
   
 The Group also evaluates the presentation of revenue on a gross versus a net basis through application of Emerging Issues Task Force No. ( EITF ) 99-19,  Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent . The consensus of this literature is that the presentation of revenue as  the gross amount billed to a customer because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or services or the net amount retained (that is, the amount billed to a customer less the amount paid to a supplier) because it has earned a commission or fee  is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. In making an evaluation of this issue, some of the factors that should be considered are: whether the Group is the primary obligor in the arrangement (strong indicator); whether it has general inventory risk (before customer 1 order is placed under or upon customer return)(strong indicator); and whether we have latitude in establishing price. The guidance clearly indicates that the evaluations of these factors, which at times can be contradictory, are subject to significant judgment and subjectivity. If the conclusion drawn is that the Group performs as an agent or a broker without assuming the risks and rewards of ownership of goods, revenue should be reported on a net basis. 
   
 On April 1, 2013, the Board of Director resolved to pay an officer for a monthly service fee of US$4,250. The fee was raised to US$10,000 per month as at October 1, 2013. The Company has an option to pay the officer by common stock in lieu of cash at a rate of $0.005 per share. During 2013, the Company issued 1,700,000 shares on June 3, 2013; 850,000 shares on July 2, 2013; 850,000 shares on August 5, 2013 and 850,000 shares on September 6, 2013 with an aggregate of 4,250,000 shares in lieu of $21,250 compensation to the officer. The amounts recorded were about $85,000 at fair price per ASC 718. 
   
 On August 25, 2016 and September 20, 2016, the Company issued 6,696,500 common shares and 32,000,000 common shares to the officer respectively. The issuance with an aggregate of 38,,696,500 common shares in lieu of $193,483 compensation to the officer under the option resolved in 2013.

  4. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  

Income Taxes   
  
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
   
 The FASB issued Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740)  Income Taxes . ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This requires that an entity recognized in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The adoption of ASC 740 did not have any impact on the Group s results of operations or financial condition for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of the date of the adoption of ASC 740, the Group has no material unrecognized tax benefit which would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. The Group has elected to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 
   
   Comprehensive income   
   
 The Company has adopted FASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 220 ( ASC 220 )  Comprehensive income  (formerly known as SFAS No. 130,  Reporting Comprehensive Income ), which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Accumulated other comprehensive income represents the accumulated balance of foreign currency translation adjustments of the Company.  
   
   Foreign currency translation   
   
 For financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the Group which are prepared using the functional currency have been translated into United States Dollars ( US$ ). The functional currencies of the Company s subsidiary operating business unit based in Hong Kong is the Hong Kong Dollar ( HK$ ). The consolidated financial statements are translated into United States dollars from Hong Kong dollars with a ratio of US$1.00=HK$7.80, a fixed exchange rate maintained between Hong Kong and United States derived from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority pegging HK$ and US$ monetary policy. 
   
 Exchange gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the determination of net income/loss for the respective periods. All of our revenue/expenses transactions are transacted in the functional currencies. We have not entered into any material transactions that are either originated, or to be settled, in currencies other than the HK$. 
   
   Fair value of financial instruments   
   
 The carrying values of the Group s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, deposits, trade and other payables approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of such instruments. The carrying amounts of borrowings approximate their fair values because the applicable interest rates approximate current market rates.

Basic and diluted earnings per share   
   
 The Group computes earnings per share ( EPS ) in accordance with FASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 ( ASC 260 )  Earnings Per Share , and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 98 ( SAB 98 ). ASC 260 requires companies with complex capital structures to present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as the income or loss available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g., convertible securities, options, and warrants) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. 
 The calculation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for nine months ended September 30, 2016 is based on the estimate fair value of the Group s common stock during such periods applied to options using the treasury stock method to determine if they are dilutive. 
   
 Effective on October 19, 2011, each of ten (10) shares of the Company s Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the  Old Common Stock  shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be reclassified as and changed into one (1) share of the Company s outstanding Common Stock, the  New Common Stock.  
 The following tables are a reconciliation of the weighted average shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods presented: 

Stock-Based Compensation   
   
 Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718,  Share-   Compensation  (formerly, FASB Statement 123R), the Group measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognizes the costs over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period. 
   
 During nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Group did not record stock-based compensation expense. 
   
 During nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Group did not record stock-based compensation expense.

Related parties transactions   
   
 A related party is generally defined as (i) any person that holds 10% or more of The Group s securities and their immediate families, (ii) the Group s management, (iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Group, or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the Group. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties. 
   
   Commitments and contingencies   
   
 Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. 
   
   Recently issued accounting pronouncements   
   
 The FASB has issued ASU No. 2015-06 about Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, which contains guidance that addresses master limited partnerships that originated from Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 07-4. This amendment in this Update specify that for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class method, the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner. In that circumstance, the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners (which is typically the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements) would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction. Qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method also are required. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. 
   
 The FASB has issued ASU No. 2015-07 about Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, which permits a reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of certain investments using the net asset value per share of the investment. The amendments in this Update remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The amendments in this Update apply to reporting entities that elect to measure the fair value of an investment within the related scope by using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. 
   
 The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). The amendments apply to reporting entities that elect to measure the fair value of an investment using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. 
   
 Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, permits a reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of certain investments using the net asset value per share of the investment. Currently, investments valued using the practical expedient are categorized within the fair value hierarchy on the basis of whether the investment is redeemable with the investee at net asset value on the measurement date, never redeemable with the investee at net asset value, or redeemable with the investee at net asset value at a future date. For investments that are redeemable with the investee at a future date, a reporting entity must consider the length of time until those investments become redeemable to determine the classification within the fair value hierarchy.

 The amendments remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. 
   
 The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. A reporting entity should apply the amendments retrospectively to all periods presented. The retrospective approach requires that an investment for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient be removed from the fair value hierarchy in all periods presented in an entity s financial statements. Earlier application is permitted. 
   
 The FASB has issued No. 2016-07  Topic 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting,  which aims to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in this Update affect all entities that have an investment that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted. 
   
 The FASB has issued No. 2016-08  Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),  which requires the entity to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide good or service to the customer (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). This determination is based upon whether the entity controls the good or the service before it is transferred to the customer. The amendments in this Update affect entities with transactions included within the scope of Topic 606. The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of Update 2014-09. Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. 
   
 The FASB has issued No. 2016-09  Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which aims to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in this Update affect all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments eliminate the guidance in Topic 718 that was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period.

 The FASB has issued No. 2016-10  Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. The amendments in this Update clarify that contractual provisions that, explicitly or implicitly, require an entity to transfer control of additional goods or services to a customer (for example, by requiring the entity to transfer control of additional rights to use or rights to access intellectual property that the customer does not already control) should be distinguished from contractual provisions that, explicitly or implicitly, define the attributes of a single promised license (for example, restrictions of time, geographical region, or use). The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective.

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
   
 Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
   
 Level 2   observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
   
 Level 3   unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
   
 ASC 820 also provides guidance for determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active, and for determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate when a transaction is not orderly. 
   
 The effective date for certain aspects of ASC 820 was deferred and currently being evaluated by The Group. Areas impacted by the deferral relate to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The effects of these remaining aspects of ASC 820 are to be applied by the Group to fair value measurements prospectively beginning November 1, 2010. The adoption of the remaining aspects of ASC 820 is not expected to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations. 

 The following table details the fair value measurements of assets and liabilities within the three levels of the fair value hierarchy at September 30, 2016 and Dec 31, 2015:

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures . 
 (a)   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  
 Based on our evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, determined that our internal controls over disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were adequate to insure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the commission rules and forms.   
 (b)   Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 using the May 2013 updated criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, we determined that our controls were effective. 
 (c)   Changes in internal controls.  
 There have been no significant changes in our internal controls or other factors that would significantly affect such controls and procedures subsequent to the date we completed our evaluation.  Therefore, no corrective actions were taken.
