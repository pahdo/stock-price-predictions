Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q") contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA"), which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause actual results to be materially different. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. Many of the forward-looking statements are located in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations and projections relating to our financial position, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as "aim," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "outlook," "potential," "project," "projection," "plan," "intend," "seek," "may," "could," "would," "will," "should," "can," "can have," "likely," the negatives thereof and other similar expressions.  
  While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements, except that the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA do not apply to any forward-looking statements relating to the operations of any of our partnerships or limited liability companies. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q in the context of the risks and uncertainties disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 30, 2015   and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the heading "Risk Factors." 
  The forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-Q are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.

NOTE 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS                 

Shake Shack Inc. ("we," "us," "our," "Shake Shack" and the "Company") was formed on September 23, 2014 as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of facilitating an initial public offering and other related transactions in order to carry on the business of SSE Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries ("SSE Holdings").   On February 4, 2015, we completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of   5,750,000   shares of our Class A common stock at a public offering price of   $21.00   per share. We used the net proceeds from the IPO to purchase newly-issued membership interests from SSE Holdings ("LLC Interests"). Following the organizational transactions completed in connection with the IPO, we became the sole managing member of SSE Holdings. As sole managing member, we operate and control all of the business and affairs of SSE Holdings and, as a result, consolidate the financial results of SSE Holdings. We report a non-controlling interest representing the economic interest in SSE Holdings held by the other members of SSE Holdings. As of   September 28, 2016   we owned   67.7%   of SSE Holdings. Unless the context otherwise requires, "we," "us," "our," "Shake Shack," the "Company," and other similar references, refer to Shake Shack Inc. and, unless otherwise stated, all of its subsidiaries, including SSE Holdings. 
  We operate and license Shake Shack restaurants ("Shacks"), which serve hamburgers, hot dogs, crinkle-cut fries, shakes, frozen custard, beer, wine and more. As of   September 28, 2016  , there were   105   Shacks in operation, system-wide, of which   58   were domestic company-operated Shacks,   six   were domestic licensed Shacks and   41   were international licensed Shacks. 
   
  NOTE   2  : SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                 

Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Shake Shack Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and on a basis consistent in all material respects with the accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 30, 2015   ("2015 Form 10-K"). In our opinion, all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operation have been included. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current year presentation. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full fiscal year. 
  The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   December 30, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in our 2015 Form 10-K.  
  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ("ASU 2015-02"). ASU 2015-02 amended the existing guidance to, among other things, modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, and eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. We adopted ASU 2015-02 on December 31, 2015. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, we consolidated SSE Holdings as a voting interest entity. Pursuant to the provisions of ASU 2015-02, SSE Holdings is now considered a VIE. Shake Shack Inc. is the primary beneficiary as we have the majority economic interest in SSE Holdings and, as the sole managing member, have decision making authority that significantly affects the economic performance of the entity, while the limited partners have no substantive kick-out or participating rights. As a result, we will continue to consolidate SSE Holdings. The assets and liabilities of SSE Holdings represent substantially all of our consolidated assets and liabilities with the exception of certain deferred taxes and liabilities under the Tax Receivable Agreement. As of   September 28, 2016   and   December 30, 2015  , the net assets of SSE Holdings were   $151,500   and   $124,214  , respectively. The assets of SSE Holdings are subject to certain restrictions in SSE Holdings' revolving credit agreements. See   Note 7   for more information.

     Table of Contents  

Fiscal Year 
  We operate on a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the last Wednesday in December. Fiscal   2016   contains   52   weeks and ends on   December 28, 2016  . Fiscal   2015   contained   52   weeks and ended on   December 30, 2015  . Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements        
  In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-05,   Customers' Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement   ("ASU 2015-05"). ASU 2015-05 provides guidance in evaluating whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the software license element of the arrangement should be accounted for as an acquisition of a software license. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, it should be accounted for as a service contract. We adopted ASU 2015-05 on December 31, 2015 and elected to adopt the standard on a prospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2015-05 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements   ("ASU 2015-15"), which clarifies the guidance set forth in Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ("ASU 2015-03"), issued in April 2015. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. ASU 2015-15 provides additional guidance regarding debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, stating that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. We adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 on December 31, 2015 and the adoption did not have a material effect our consolidated financial statements. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements        
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Payments   ("ASU 2016-15").  ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted.    We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-04,   Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products   ("ASU 2016-04"). ASU 2016-04 entitles a company to derecognize amounts related to expected breakage in proportion to the pattern of rights expected to be exercised by the product holder to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of the recognized breakage amount will not subsequently occur. ASU 2016-04 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is to be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-04 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases   ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 establishes a new lease accounting model, that, for many companies, eliminates the concept of operating leases and requires entities to record assets and liabilities related to leases on the balance sheet for certain types of leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires the entity to apply a modified retrospective transition method for existing leases subject to certain transition relief. Early adoption will be permitted for all entities. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ("ASU 2016-01"). ASU 2016-01 requires: (i) equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (ii) simplification of the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; (iii) elimination of the requirement for public entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; (iv) public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (v) an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; (vi) separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and (vii) clarification that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. ASU 2016-01 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and amendments should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted, subject to certain conditions.  We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-01 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   ("ASU 2015-11"). Under ASU 2015-11 entities should measure inventory that is not measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method, including inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost, at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is to be applied prospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the existing revenue recognition guidance and clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. In March 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to ASU 2014-09 clarifying the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to ASU 2014-09 clarifying the considerations for identifying performance obligations and the implementation guidance for revenue recognized from licensing arrangements. In August 2015, the FASB issued an update to ASU 2014-09 deferring the effective date for public entities, on a retrospective basis, to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, subject to certain conditions. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements, as well as the expected timing and method of adoption.

    The fair value of marketable securities with contractual maturity dates within one year are included in marketable securities and those with contractual maturity dates greater than one year are included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Corporate debt securities were measured at fair value using a market approach utilizing observable prices for identical securities or securities with similar characteristics and inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
       
  The gross aggregate fair value of investments in an unrealized loss position as of   September 28, 2016   was   $1,526  . All investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of   September 28, 2016   have been in a continuous loss position for less than 12 months. Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities totaling   $27   were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 28, 2016  . There were   no   unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  .

Realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification method and are included in other income,net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). 
  The following table summarizes, by contractual maturity date, the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable debt securities that are accounted for as available-for-sale securities: 

We periodically review our marketable securities for other-than-temporary impairment. We consider factors such as the duration, severity and the reason for the decline in value, the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For our debt securities, we also consider whether (i) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, and (ii) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. As of   September 28, 2016   and December 30, 2015, the declines in the market value of our marketable securities investment portfolio were considered to be temporary in nature. 
  Other Financial Instruments 
  The carrying value of our other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses as of   September 28, 2016   and December 30, 2015 approximated their fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.

NOTE   7  : DEBT                 

In January 2015, we executed a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which became effective on February 4, 2015 (together with the prior agreements and amendments, and as further amended, the "Revolving Credit Facility"), which provides for a revolving total commitment amount of   $50,000  , of which   $20,000   is available immediately. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable   five   years from the effective date. The Revolving Credit Facility permits the issuance of letters of credit upon our request of up to   $10,000  . In May 2016, the Revolving Credit Facility was amended to, among other things, lower the borrowing rates. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either: (i) LIBOR plus a percentage ranging from   2.3%   to   3.3%   or (ii) the prime rate plus a percentage ranging from   0.0%   to   0.8%  , depending on the type of borrowing made under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of   September 28, 2016   and December 30, 2015, there were   no   amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.  As of   September 28, 2016  , we had   $19,920   of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, after giving effect to   $80   in outstanding letters of credit.  
  The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of SSE Holdings and the guarantors. The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by each of SSE Holdings' wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (with certain exceptions). 
  The Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to, subject to specified exceptions, incur additional debt; incur additional liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve ourselves; pay dividends or make distributions; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains certain cross-default provisions. We are required to maintain a specified consolidated fixed-charge coverage ratio and a specified funded net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, both as defined under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of   September 28, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants.  
  In March 2013, we entered into a promissory note in the amount of   $313   in connection with the purchase of a liquor license. Interest on the outstanding principal balance of this note is due and payable on a monthly basis from the effective date at a rate of   5.0%   per year. The entire principal balance and interest is due and payable on the earlier of the maturity date, which is the expiration of the lease in   June 2023  , or the date of the sale of the license.  As of   December 30, 2015   the outstanding balance of the promissory note was   $313  . During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , we repaid the entire outstanding balance of the promissory note.   No   amounts were outstanding as of   September 28, 2016  . 
  Total interest costs incurred were   $89   and   $267   for the   thirteen   and   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , respectively, and   $83   and   $353     for the   thirteen   and   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Total amounts capitalized into property and equipment were   $108   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  .    No   amounts were capitalized for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  .

NOTE   8  : NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS                 

We are the sole managing member of SSE Holdings and, as a result, consolidate the financial results of SSE Holdings. We report a non-controlling interest representing the economic interest in SSE Holdings held by the other members of SSE Holdings.   The Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the "LLC Agreement") of SSE Holdings provides that holders of LLC Interests may, from time to time, require SSE Holdings to redeem all or a portion of their LLC Interests for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.  In connection with any redemption or exchange, we will receive a corresponding number of LLC Interests, increasing our total ownership interest in SSE Holdings.   Changes in our ownership interest in SSE Holdings while we retain our controlling interest in SSE Holdings will be accounted for as equity transactions. As such, future redemptions or direct exchanges of LLC Interests in SSE Holdings by the other members of SSE Holdings will result in a change in ownership and reduce the amount recorded as non-controlling interest and increase additional paid-in capital. 
  The following table summarizes the ownership interest in SSE Holdings as of   September 28, 2016   and   December 30, 2015  . 

The weighted average ownership percentages for the applicable reporting periods are used to attribute net income and other comprehensive   loss   to Shake Shack Inc. and the non-controlling interest holders. The non-controlling interest holders' weighted average ownership percentage for the   thirteen   and   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   was   33.9%   and   38.5%  , respectively. For the   thirteen   and   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  , net income was attributed to non-controlling interest holders only for the period subsequent to the IPO and the organizational transactions completed in connection with our IPO, based on a weighted-average ownership percentage of   62.5%   and   65.1%  , respectively.

The following table summarizes the effects of changes in ownership in SSE Holdings on our equity during the   thirteen   and   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 

In February 2015, we used the net proceeds from our IPO to purchase   5,750,000     newly-issued LLC Interests. Additionally, in connection with our IPO, we acquired   5,968,841     LLC Interests through the acquisition, by merger, of two entities that were owned by former indirect members of SSE Holdings. Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, we received   339,306     LLC Interests as a result of the issuance of   339,306     shares of Class A common stock in settlement of the outstanding UARs.  
  During   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , an aggregate of   4,706,663   LLC Interests were redeemed by non-controlling interest holders for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock, and we received   4,706,663   LLC Interests in connection with these redemptions, increasing our total ownership interest in SSE Holdings. During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015     3,155,273   LLC Interests were redeemed by the non-controlling interest holders in connection with the secondary offering.  
  During   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , we received an aggregate of   101,837   LLC Interests in connection with the exercise of employee stock options.   No   stock options were exercised during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  .

Unit Appreciation Rights 
  Prior to the IPO, we maintained a Unit Appreciation Rights Plan (the "UAR Plan"), effective in fiscal year 2012, and as amended, whereby we had the authority to grant up to   31,303   unit appreciation rights ("UARs") to employees. The UARs granted were subject to continued employment and were only exercisable upon a qualifying transaction, which was either a change of control or an initial public offering. Our IPO constituted a qualifying transaction under the terms of the UAR Plan, and as a result   339,306   shares of Class A common stock were issued upon the settlement of the   22,554   outstanding UARs, net of employee withholding taxes. We recognized compensation expense of   $11,762   during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015   upon settlement of the outstanding UARs.  
  There were   no   UARs outstanding as of   September 28, 2016   or   December 30, 2015  .   No   compensation expense was recognized during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  . 
  Restricted Class B Units 
  Prior to the IPO, we granted restricted Class B units to certain of our executive officers. These awards were to vest in equal installments over periods ranging from   three   to   five   years. If not already fully vested, these units would fully vest (i) upon the occurrence of a change in control event or (ii) upon the occurrence of an initial public offering. The IPO constituted a transaction under the terms of the restricted Class B unit award agreements that resulted in the accelerated vesting of all then-outstanding awards, and we recognized   $605   of equity-based compensation expense upon the vesting of these awards during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  There were   no   restricted Class B units outstanding as of   September 28, 2016   or   December 30, 2015  .   No   compensation expense was recorded during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  . 
  Stock Options 
  In January 2015, we adopted the 2015 Incentive Award Plan (the "2015 Plan") under which we may grant up to   5,865,522   stock options and other equity-based awards to employees, directors and officers. The stock options granted generally vest equally over periods ranging from   one   to   five   years. We do not use cash to settle any of our equity-based awards, and we issue new shares of Class A common stock upon the exercise of stock options. 
  The fair value of stock option awards was determined on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model based on the following weighted-average assumptions: 

(1) 
    Expected term represents the estimated period of time until an award is exercised and was determined using the simplified method. 
              (2) 
    Expected volatility is based on a combination of our historical volatility and the historical volatility of a selected peer group over a period equivalent to the expected term. 
              (3) 
    The risk-free rate rate is an interpolation of yields on U.S. Treasury securities with maturities equivalent to the expected term. 
              (4) 
    We have assumed a dividend yield of zero as we have no plans to declare dividends in the foreseeable future.

A summary of stock option activity for   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   is as follows: 

The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   was   $34.62  .   As of   September 28, 2016  , there were   2,444,403   stock options outstanding, of which   453,760   were exercisable. As of   September 28, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, including an estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures, was   $13,707  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   3.3   years. 
  Performance Stock Units 
  Under the 2015 Plan, we may grant performance stock units and other types of performance-based equity awards that vest based on the outcome of certain performance criteria that are established and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The actual number of equity awards earned is based on the level of performance achieved over a predetermined performance period, relative to established financial goals, none of which are considered market conditions.  
  For performance stock units granted during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , the amount of awards that can be earned range from   0%   to   125%   of the number of performance stock units granted, based on the achievement of approved financial goals over a performance period that is approximately   one year  . In addition to the performance conditions, performance stock units are also subject to a requisite service period and the awards will vest ratably over   three years  . The fair value of performance stock units is determined based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense related to the performance stock units is recognized using a graded-vesting attribution method over the vesting period based on the most probable outcome of the performance conditions. 
  A summary of performance stock unit activity for   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   is as follows: 

As of   September 28, 2016  , there were   62,800   performance stock units outstanding, of which   none   were exercisable. As of   September 28, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested performance stock units, including an estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures, was   $1,901  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.6   years.

NOTE     10  : INCOME TAXES                 

We are the sole managing member of SSE Holdings, and as a result, consolidate the financial results of SSE Holdings. SSE Holdings is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, SSE Holdings is not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by SSE Holdings is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including us, on a pro rata basis. We are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income or loss of SSE Holdings, as well as any stand-alone income or loss generated by Shake Shack Inc. We are also subject to withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.  
  Income Tax Expense 
  A reconciliation of income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the recognized income tax expense is as follows: 

Our effective income tax rates for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   26.5%   and   19.8%  , respectively. The increase in our effective income tax rate for the period is primarily due to an increase in our ownership interest in SSE Holdings.  As our ownership interest in SSE Holdings increases, our share of the taxable income of SSE Holdings also increases. Our weighted-average ownership interest in SSE Holdings was   66.1%   and   37.5%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Our effective income tax rates for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   26.6%   and   97.3%  , respectively. As the non-recurring compensation expenses and other IPO-related expenses recognized during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015   were incurred in the period prior to the organizational transactions completed in connection with the IPO, and prior to our becoming a member of SSE Holdings, we are not entitled to any tax benefits related to those losses. We recognized tax expense on our allocable share of the pre-tax income generated in the period subsequent to becoming a member of SSE Holdings, which resulted in a very high effective tax rate when compared to our consolidated pre-tax income. Our weighted-average ownership interest in SSE Holdings was   61.5%   and   34.9%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities 
  During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , we acquired an aggregate of   4,808,500   LLC Interests in connection with the redemption of LLC Interests and the exercise of employee stock options. We recognized an additional deferred tax asset in the amount of   $61,470   associated with the change in the basis difference in our investment in SSE Holdings upon acquisition of these LLC Interests. However, a portion of the total basis difference will only reverse upon the eventual sale of our interest in SSE Holdings, which we expect would result in a capital loss. As of   September 28, 2016  , we established a valuation allowance in the amount of   $16,398   against the deferred tax asset to which this portion relates. 
  During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , we also recognized   $36,456   of deferred tax assets related to additional tax basis increases generated from expected future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and related deductions for imputed interest on such payments. See " Tax Receivable Agreement" for more information.

     Table of Contents  

We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and establish valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. As of   September 28, 2016  , we concluded, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, that all of our deferred tax assets (except for those deferred tax assets described above relating to basis differences that are expected to result in a capital loss upon the eventual sale of our interest in SSE Holdings) are more likely than not to be realized. As such, no additional valuation allowance was recognized.  
  Uncertain Tax Positions 
  No   uncertain tax positions existed as of   September 28, 2016  . Shake Shack Inc. was formed in September 2014 and did not engage in any operations prior to the IPO and related organizational transactions. Shake Shack Inc. first filed tax returns for tax year 2014, which is the first tax year subject to examination by taxing authorities for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Additionally, although SSE Holdings is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and state income taxes purposes, it is still required to file an annual U.S. Return of Partnership Income, which is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). The statute of limitations has expired for tax years through 2012 for SSE Holdings. 
  Tax Receivable Agreement 
  Pursuant to our election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), we expect to obtain an increase in our share of the tax basis in the net assets of SSE Holdings when LLC Interests are redeemed or exchanged by the other members of SSE Holdings. We plan to make an election under Section 754 of Code for each taxable year in which a redemption or exchange of LLC Interest occurs. We intend to treat any redemptions and exchanges of LLC Interests as direct purchases of LLC Interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that we would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities. They may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. 
  On February 4, 2015, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with certain of the then-existing members of SSE Holdings (the "Tax Receivable Agreement") that provides for the payment by us of   85%   of the amount of any tax benefits that we actually realize, or in some cases are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) increases in our share of the tax basis in the net assets of SSE Holdings resulting from any redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests, (ii) tax basis increases attributable to payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and (iii) deductions attributable to imputed interest pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement (the "TRA Payments"). We expect to benefit from the remaining   15%   of any tax benefits that we may actually realize. The TRA Payments are not conditioned upon any continued ownership interest in SSE Holdings or us. The rights of each SSE Holdings member party under the Tax Receivable Agreement are assignable to transferees of its LLC Interests.  
  During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , we acquired an aggregate of   4,706,663   LLC Interests in connection with the redemption of LLC Interests, which resulted in an increase in the tax basis of our investment in SSE Holdings subject to the provisions of the Tax Receivable Agreement. We recognized an additional liability in the amount of   $90,776   for the TRA Payments due to the redeeming members, representing   85%   of the aggregate tax benefits we expect to realize from the tax basis increases related to the redemption of LLC Interests, after concluding it was probable that such TRA Payments would be paid based on our estimates of future taxable income. As of   September 28, 2016  , the total amount of TRA Payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement, including accrued interest, was   $263,881  , of which   $1,979   was included in other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. See   Note 13   for more information relating to our liabilities under the Tax Receivable Agreement.

NOTE     11  : EARNINGS PER SHARE                 

Basic earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net income available to Shake Shack Inc. by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net income available to Shake Shack Inc. by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive securities. 
  The following table sets forth reconciliations of the numerators and denominators used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock for the   thirteen   and   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 

Shares of our Class B common stock do not share in the earnings or losses of Shake Shack and are therefore not participating securities. As such, separate presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock under the two-class method has not been presented.

(1) 
    Excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock because the effect would have been anti-dilutive since we recognized a net loss for the period. 
              (2) 
    Excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock because the performance conditions associated with these awards were not met assuming the end of the reporting period was the end of the performance period. 
              (3) 
    Shares of our Class B common stock are considered potentially dilutive shares of Class A common stock. Amounts have been excluded from the computations of diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock because the effect would have been anti-dilutive under the if-converted and two-class methods.

NOTE   13  : COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES                 

Lease Commitments 
  We are obligated under various operating leases for Shacks and our home office space, expiring in various years through 2035. Under certain of these leases, we are liable for contingent rent based on a percentage of sales in excess of specified thresholds and are typically responsible for our proportionate share of real estate taxes, common area maintenance charges and utilities.  
  As security under the terms of several of our leases, we are obligated under letters of credit totaling   $160   as of   September 28, 2016  . The letters of credit expire on April 23, 2017 and February 28, 2026. In addition, in December 2013, we entered into an irrevocable standby letter of credit in conjunction with our home office lease in the amount of   $80  . The letter of credit expires in September 2017 and renews automatically for   one  -year periods through September 30, 2019. 
  Purchase Commitments 
  Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, including commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities, firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. These obligations are generally short-term in nature and are recorded as liabilities when the related goods are received or services rendered. We also enter into   long-term, exclusive contracts with certain vendors to supply us with food, beverages and paper goods, obligating us to purchase specified quantities.  
  Legal Contingencies 
  In November 2015, we met with a law firm representing   two   former Shake Shack managers who alleged that we improperly classified our restaurant managers as exempt.  Although we have always believed that our managers are properly classified as exempt under both federal and state laws, and have always intended to defend any allegations to the contrary vigorously, we agreed to mediate the matter. At the conclusion of the meeting, the parties entered into a Memorandum of Understanding, and we agreed to create a fund of   $750   to settle the matter. In exchange, all managers who choose to participate (former and current), including the   two   former managers, will release Shake Shack from all federal and/or state wage and hour claims that may exist through the settlement date.  As part of the settlement process, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement on March 11, 2016, and the law firm filed a Complaint on March 17, 2016 with the Supreme Court of the State of New York (the  Court ), a request for judicial intervention on March 19, 2016 and a motion seeking the Court s preliminary approval of the class action settlement on May 20, 2016.  On October 25, 2016, the Court issued its order granting the law firm's motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement. As of   September 28, 2016  , an accrual in the amount of   $770   was recorded for this matter and the related expenses. 
  We are subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings, claims and liabilities, such as employment-related claims and slip and fall cases, which arise in the ordinary course of business and are generally covered by insurance. As of   September 28, 2016  , the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these matters was not material. 
  Liabilities under Tax Receivable Agreement 
  As described in   Note 10  , we are a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement under which we are contractually committed to pay certain of the members of SSE Holdings   85%   of the amount of any tax benefits that we actually realize, or in some cases are deemed to realize, as a result of certain transactions. We are not obligated to make any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement until the tax benefits associated with the transactions that gave rise to the payments are realized. Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of future taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) future changes in tax laws. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the tax benefits, then we would not be required to make the related TRA Payments. During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , we recognized liabilities totaling   $90,776   and   $103,356  , respectively, relating to our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, after concluding that it was probable that we would have sufficient future taxable income to utilize the related tax benefits. As of   September 28, 2016   and   December 30, 2015  , our total obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, including accrued interest, were   $263,881   and   $173,090  , respectively. There were no transactions subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement for which we did not recognize the related liability, as we concluded that we would have sufficient future taxable income to utilize all of the related tax benefits.

  OVERVIEW                 

Shake Shack is a modern day "roadside" burger stand serving a classic American menu of premium burgers, hot dogs, crinkle cut fries, shakes, frozen custard, beer and wine. As of   September 28, 2016  , there were   105   Shacks in operation, system-wide, of which   58   were domestic company-operated Shacks,   six   were domestic licensed Shacks and   41   were international licensed Shacks. 
  Development Highlights 
  During the quarter, the Company opened   seven   domestic company-operated Shacks, including the Company's 100th opening at the Boston Seaport, its first Shack in Dallas at The Crescent, a second Shack in the Los Angeles market at The Americana in Glendale.  Additionally, the Company opened   three   net new licensed Shacks, including its first Shack in South Korea in Seoul's Gangnam district, as well a third Shack in the Japan market at the Tokyo International Forum. 
  Financial Highlights for the   Third   Quarter   2016 
               
    Same-Shack sales increased   2.9%  . 
                    
    Adjusted pro forma net   income  *, a non-GAAP measure,   increase  d   25.1%   to   $5.5 million  , or $  0.15   per fully exchanged and diluted share. 
       
  * Shack-level operating profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income are non-GAAP measures. See " Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for reconciliations of Shack-level operating profit to operating income, adjusted EBITDA to net   income  , and

adjusted pro forma net   income   to net   income   (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc., the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. 
  We continued to execute on our growth strategies in 2016 and the   third   quarter of   2016   was positively impacted by the following: (i) an approximate 1.5% menu price increase implemented at the end of December 2015, (ii) menu innovation and positive mix shifts from the Chick'n Shack and the Bacon CheddarShack, and (iii) lower commodity prices, primarily in beef and dairy.  
  Net   income   attributable to Shake Shack Inc. was   $3.8 million  , or   $0.15   per diluted share, for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $1.5 million  , or   $0.10   per diluted share, for the same period last year. On an adjusted pro forma basis, which excludes certain non-recurring items and assumes that all outstanding LLC Interests were exchanged for shares of Class A common stock as of the beginning of the period, we would have recognized net   income   of   $5.5 million  , or $  0.15   per fully exchanged and diluted share, for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $4.4 million  , or   $0.12   per fully exchanged and diluted share for the the   third   quarter of   2015  , an   increase   of   25.1%  . 
  FISCAL 2016 OUTLOOK

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                 

The following table summarizes our results of operations for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  : 

(1) 
    As a percentage of Shack sales. 
     Shack Sales 
  Shack sales represent the aggregate sales of food, beverages and Shake Shack branded merchandise at our domestic company-operated Shacks. Shack sales in any period are directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of open Shacks and same-Shack sales. Same-Shack sales means, for any reporting period, sales for the comparable Shack base, which we define as the number of domestic company-operated Shacks open for 24 months or longer. 
  Shack sales were   $71.9 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $51.3 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $20.6 million   or   40.2%  . The growth in Shack sales was primarily driven by the opening of   17   new domestic company-operated Shacks between   September 30, 2015   and   September 28, 2016  , as well as same-Shack sales growth of   $1.0 million  , or   2.9%  . The increase in same-Shack sales is primarily due to a combined increase of   3.6%   in price and sales mix offset by decreased guest traffic of   0.7%  . For purposes of calculating same-Shack sales growth, Shack sales for   26   Shacks were included in the comparable Shack base.  
    
  Shack sales were   $188.4 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $133.9 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $54.5 million   or   40.7%  . The increase is primarily due to the opening of   17   new  
  
   Shake Shack Inc.       Form 10-Q    |     29 

     Table of Contents  

domestic company-operated Shacks between   September 30, 2015   and   September 28, 2016  , as well as same-Shack sales growth of   $4.6 million  , or   5.3%  .  The increase in same-Shack sales is primarily due to increased guest traffic of   2.1%   as well as a combined increase of   3.2%   in price and sales mix. For purposes of calculating same-Shack sales growth, Shack sales for   26   Shacks were included in the comparable Shack base. 
  Licensing Revenue 
  Licensing revenue is comprised of license fees, opening fees for certain licensed Shacks and territory fees. License fees are calculated as a percentage of sales and territory fees are payments for the exclusive right to develop Shacks in a specific geographic area. 
  Licensing revenue was   $2.7 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016     compared to   $2.0 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $0.7 million   or   34.9%  . Licensing revenue was   $6.8 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $5.6 million     thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $1.2 million   or   20.4%  . The   increase  s for the   thirteen and thirty-nine week periods   were primarily driven by   13   net new licensed Shacks opened between   September 30, 2015   and   September 28, 2016  , offset by lower revenue from Shacks in the Middle East and U.K. 
  Food and Paper Costs 
  Food and paper costs include the direct costs associated with food, beverage and packaging of our menu items. The components of food and paper costs are variable by nature, changing with sales volume, and are impacted by menu mix and fluctuations in commodity costs.  
  Food and paper costs were   $20.4 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $14.9 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $5.5 million   or   36.6%  . Food and paper costs were   $53.5 million   for the     thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $39.7 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $13.8 million   or   35.0%  . The   increase  s   for the   thirteen and thirty-nine week periods   were primarily due to the opening of   17   new domestic company-operated Shacks between   September 30, 2015   and   September 28, 2016  .  
  As a percentage of Shack sales, food and paper costs   decrease  d to   28.4%   for both the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , respectively, from   29.1%   and   29.6%   for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. These decreases were the result of menu price increases implemented at the end of December 2015, lower commodity costs, primarily in beef and dairy, and to a lesser extent, efficiencies gained through supply chain enhancements, such as the restructuring of certain of our purchasing arrangements and better geographic diversification of our suppliers. These decreases were partially offset by higher distribution costs associated with entering new markets. 
  Labor and Related Expenses 
  Labor and related expenses include domestic company-operated Shack-level hourly and management wages, bonuses, payroll taxes, equity-based compensation, workers' compensation expense and medical benefits. As we expect with other variable expense items, we expect labor costs to grow as our Shack sales grow. Factors that influence labor costs include minimum wage and payroll tax legislation, health care costs and the performance of our domestic company-operated Shacks. 
  Labor and related expenses were   $18.2 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $12.2 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $6.0 million   or   49.6%  . Labor and related expenses were   $46.6 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $32.4 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $14.2 million   or   43.8%  . These   increase  s for the   thirteen and thirty-nine week periods   were primarily due to the opening of   17   new domestic company-operated Shacks between   September 30, 2015   and   September 28, 2016  .  
  As a percentage of Shack sales, labor and related expenses   increase  d to   25.3%   and   24.8%   for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , respectively, compared to   23.7%   and   24.2%   for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The   increase  s for the   thirteen and thirty-nine week periods   were primarily due to increases in hourly labor expenses as a result of the company-wide increase to the starting wage of all hourly team members that we implemented in January 2016 as well as an increase in medical claims for the period. 
  Other Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses were   $6.6 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $4.4 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $2.2 million   or   50.3%  . Other operating expenses were   $17.5 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $11.6 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $5.9 million   or   50.9%  . The   increase  s for the   thirteen and thirty-nine week periods   were primarily due to the opening of   17   new domestic company-operated Shacks between   September 30, 2015   and   September 28, 2016  . 
  As a percentage of Shack sales, other operating expenses   increase  d to   9.2%   and   9.3%   for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , respectively, compared to   8.5%   and   8.6%   for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The   increase   was primarily due to higher repair and maintenance costs as our base of mature Shacks has grown and the introduction of more Shacks into the system.  
  Occupancy and Related Expenses 
  Occupancy and related expenses consist of Shack-level occupancy expenses (including rent, common area expenses and certain local taxes), excluding pre-opening costs, which are recorded separately. 
  Occupancy and related expenses were   $6.0 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $4.2 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $1.8 million   or   42.9%  . Occupancy and related expenses were   $15.5 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $11.2 million   or the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $4.3 million   or   38.2%  . The   increase  s for the   thirteen and thirty-nine week periods   were primarily due to the opening of   17   new domestic company-operated Shacks between   September 30, 2015   and   September 28, 2016  .  
  As a percentage of Shack sales, occupancy and related expenses   increase  d to   8.4%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   from   8.2%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the introduction of more target-volume Shacks into the system. For the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , occupancy and related expenses as a percentage of Shack sales   decrease  d to   8.2%   compared to   8.4%   in the prior year, primarily due to increased amounts of amortization of tenant improvement allowances. 
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses consist of costs associated with corporate and administrative functions that support Shack development and operations, as well as equity-based compensation expense. 
  General and administrative expenses were   $7.9 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $5.7 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $2.2 million   or   37.7%  . The   increase   was primarily driven by higher payroll expense from increased headcount at our home office to support our growth plans as well as the costs associated with our Annual Leadership Retreat which occurred in the second quarter of last year but are included in the third quarter of this year. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses   decrease  d to   10.6%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   from   10.8%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to the increased levels of Shack sales. 
  General and administrative expenses were   $22.3 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $30.2 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   a     decrease   of   $7.9 million   or   26.2%  . As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses   decrease  d to   11.4%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   21.6%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to IPO-related expenses incurred in the prior year for which none were incurred in the current year, including   $12.8 million   of non-recurring compensation expenses incurred in connection with the vesting of equity awards upon consummation of our IPO and   $0.6 million   of other IPO-related expenses.  These were partially offset by higher consulting fees related to maintaining our complex organizational structure, incremental costs associated with our first annual shareholders' meeting as well as the aforementioned increases from increased payroll. 
  Depreciation Expense 
  Depreciation expense consists of the depreciation of fixed assets, including leasehold improvements and equipment.

Depreciation expense was   $3.7 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $2.6 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $1.1 million   or   41.1%  . Depreciation expense was   $10.2 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $7.3 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $2.9 million   or   40.6%  . The   increase  s for the   thirteen and thirty-nine week periods   were due primarily to incremental depreciation of property and equipment related to the opening of   17   new domestic company-operated Shacks between   September 30, 2015   and   September 28, 2016  .  
  As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation expense   increase  d to   5.0%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   4.9%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the introduction of more Shacks into the system. For the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , depreciation expense as a percentage of total revenue remained constant at   5.2%    
  Pre-Opening Costs 
  Pre-opening costs consist primarily of legal fees, rent, managers' salaries, training costs, employee payroll and related expenses, costs to relocate and compensate Shack management teams prior to an opening and wages, as well as travel and lodging costs for our opening training team. All such costs incurred prior to the opening of a domestic company-operated Shack are expensed in the period in which the expense was incurred. Pre-opening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on the number and timing of domestic company-operated Shack openings and the specific pre-opening costs incurred for each domestic company-operated Shack. Additionally, domestic company-operated Shack openings in new geographic market areas will initially experience higher pre-opening costs than our established geographic market areas, such as the New York City metropolitan area, where we have greater economies of scale and incur lower travel and lodging costs for our training team. 
  Pre-opening costs were   $2.6 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , compared to   $1.4 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $1.2 million   or   85.4%  . Pre-opening costs were   $6.7 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $4.1 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $2.6 million   or   65.5%  . The variances for the   thirteen and thirty-nine week periods   were due to the timing and total number of new domestic company-operated Shacks expected to open as well as an increase in the number of Shacks opened in new geographic markets. 
  Loss on Disposal of Property and Equipment 
  Loss on disposal of property and equipment represents the net book value of assets that have been retired and consists primarily of furniture and fixtures that were replaced in the normal course of business. 
  For all periods presented, the loss on disposal of property and equipment was not material. 
  Other Income 
  Other income consists of interest income, dividend income and net realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities. 
  For all periods presented, other income was not material. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense primarily consists of amortization of deferred financing costs, imputed interest on deferred compensation, interest on the current portion of our liabilities under the Tax Receivable Agreement, as well as interest and fees on our Revolving Credit Facility. 
  For all periods presented, interest expense was not material. 
  Income Tax Expense 
  Income tax   expense   was   $2.4 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $1.5 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  . Our effective income tax rate   increase  d to   26.5%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   from   19.8%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  .

Income tax   expense   was   $6.1 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $2.8 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  . Our effective income tax rate   decrease  d to   26.6%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   from   97.3%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  As a result of the IPO and certain organizational transactions completed in connection with our IPO, we became the sole managing member of SSE Holdings, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, SSE Holdings is not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by SSE Holdings is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including us, on a pro rata basis. We are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income or loss generated by SSE Holdings. As the non-recurring compensation expenses and other IPO-related expenses recognized during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015   were incurred in the period prior to the organizational transactions completed in connection with the IPO, and prior to our becoming a member of SSE Holdings, we are not entitled to any tax benefits related to those losses. We recognized tax expense on our allocable share of the pre-tax income generated in the period subsequent to becoming a member of SSE Holdings, which resulted in a very high effective tax rate when compared to our consolidated pre-tax income. 
  Additionally, as our ownership interest in SSE Holdings increases, our share of the taxable income of SSE Holdings will also increase. When compared to consolidated pre-tax income, this will result in increases to our effective income tax rate. Our weighted-average ownership interest in SSE Holdings increased to   66.1%   and   61.5%     for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , respectively,   compared to   37.5%   and   34.9%   for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. This increase in ownership interest was the primary driver for the increase in our effective income tax rate for the thirteen week period. 
  Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests 
  We are the sole managing member of SSE Holdings and have the sole voting power in, and control the management of, SSE Holdings. Accordingly, we consolidate the financial results of SSE Holdings and report a non-controlling interest on our Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the portion of net income attributable to the other members of SSE Holdings. The LLC Agreement of SSE Holdings provides that holders of LLC Interests may, from time to time, require SSE Holdings to redeem all or a portion of their LLC Interests for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.  In connection with any redemption or exchange, we will receive a corresponding number of LLC Interests, increasing our total ownership interest in SSE Holdings.   The weighted average ownership percentages for the applicable reporting periods are used to attribute net income and other comprehensive income to Shake Shack Inc. and the non-controlling interest holders.  
  Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was   $3.0 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $4.7 million   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $1.7 million   or   35.2%  . This   decrease   was primarily driven by an increase in our weighted-average ownership interest in SSE Holdings from   37.5%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 30, 2015   to   66.1%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , as result of redemptions of LLC Interests. 
  Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was   $8.2 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   compared to   $10.1 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $1.9 million   or   19.2%  . This   decrease   was primarily driven by an increase in our weighted-average ownership interest in SSE Holdings for the thirty-nine week period. In the prior year, our weighted-average ownership interest in SSE Holdings was   34.9%     for the period subsequent to the IPO and the organizational transactions completed in connection with our IPO through   September 30, 2015  , compared   to   61.5%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , as result of redemptions of LLC Interests. Additionally, a  s the non-recurring compensation expenses and other IPO-related expenses were incurred in the period prior to the IPO, no portion of these expenses were attributed to the non-controlling interest holders. As a result, the net income attributable to non-controlling interests is significantly higher than the consolidated net income for the prior year period.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                 

To supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Shack-level operating profit, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share (collectively the "non-GAAP financial measures"). We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in our financial and operational decision making. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures we use are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. 
  Shack-Level Operating Profit 
  Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin are supplemental measures of operating performance and are not required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, are important measures we use to evaluate the performance and profitability of each Shack, individually and in the aggregate. A reconciliation of Shack-level operating profit to operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is set forth below.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA  
  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net   income   or cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure the operating performance of our business, facilitate internal comparisons to historical performance and competitors' operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is also utilized as a performance metric in our bonus and equity incentive plans. A reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net   income  , the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is set forth below. 

(  1) 
    Effective September 28, 2016, we no longer excludes pre-opening costs from our computation of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015   has been restated to conform to the current period computation methodology. 
              (2) 
    Represents non-cash equity-based compensation expense and relate solely to stock options and performance stock units granted subsequent to our IPO. 
              (3) 
    Reflects the extent to which rent expense is greater than or less than cash rent payments. 
              (4) 
    Includes the loss on disposal of property and equipment in the ordinary course of business. 
              (5) 
    Non-recurring compensation expense incurred in connection with our IPO. Includes expense recognized upon settlement of outstanding unit appreciation rights, the related employer withholding taxes and the accelerated vesting of outstanding restricted Class B units. 
              (6) 
    Costs incurred in connection with our IPO, including legal, accounting and other related expenses.

Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share 
  Adjusted pro forma net income represents net   income (loss)   attributable to Shake Shack Inc. assuming the full exchange of all outstanding SSE Holdings, LLC membership interests ("LLC Interests") for shares of Class A common stock, adjusted for certain non-recurring items that we don't believe directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our recurring business operations. Adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share is calculated by dividing adjusted pro forma net income by the weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding, assuming the full exchange of all outstanding LLC Interests, after giving effect to the dilutive effect of outstanding equity-based awards. 
  Adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share, as determined by GAAP. We believe adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share supplement GAAP measures and enable us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period and relative to our competitors. A reconciliation of adjusted pro forma net income to net   income (loss)   attributable to Shake Shack Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the computation of adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share are set forth below. 

(1) 
    Assumes the exchange of all outstanding LLC Interests for shares of Class A common stock, resulting in the elimination of non-controlling interests and recognition of net income attributable to non-controlling interests. 
              (2) 
    Non-recurring compensation expense incurred in connection with our IPO. Includes expense recognized upon settlement of outstanding unit appreciation rights, the related employer withholding taxes and the accelerated vesting of outstanding restricted Class B units. 
              (3) 
    Costs incurred in connection with our IPO, including legal, accounting and other related expenses. 
              (4) 
    Represents the tax effect of the aforementioned adjustments and pro forma adjustments to reflect corporate income taxes at assumed effective tax rates of   40.7%   and   40.6%   for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , respectively, and   43.3%   and   44.0%   for the and   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. Amounts include provisions for U.S. federal and state income taxes, certain LLC entity-level taxes and foreign withholding taxes, assuming the highest statutory rates apportioned to each applicable state, local and foreign jurisdiction.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand, short-term investments and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of   September 28, 2016  , we maintained a cash and cash equivalents balance of   $12.2 million  , a short-term investments balance of   $61.3 million   and had   $19.9 million   of availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
  Our primary requirements for liquidity are to fund our working capital needs, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and general corporate needs. Our requirements for working capital are not significant because our guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or on debit or credit cards at the time of the sale and we are able to sell many of our inventory items before payment is due to the supplier of such items. Our ongoing capital expenditures are principally related to opening new Shacks, existing Shack capital investments (both for remodels and maintenance), as well as investments in our corporate infrastructure.  
  In addition, we are obligated to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. As of   September 28, 2016  , such obligations totaled   $263.9 million  .   Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of future taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) future changes in tax laws. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the tax benefits, then we would not be required to make the related TRA Payments. Although the amount of any payments that must be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be significant, the timing of these payments will vary and will generally be limited to one payment per member per year. The amount of such payments are also limited to the extent we utilize the related deferred tax assets. The payments that we are required to make will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us or to SSE Holdings, but we expect the cash tax savings we will realize from the utilization of the related deferred tax assets to fund the required payments.  
  We believe that cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. 
  Summary of Cash Flows 
  The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. 

Operating Activities 
  For the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   net cash   provided by   operating activities was   $40.5 million   compared to   $30.9 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $9.6 million  . This   increase   was primarily driven by the opening of   17   new domestic company-operated Shacks. 
  Investing Activities 
  For the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016   net cash used in investing activities was   $99.3 million   compared to   $25.3 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an     increase   of   $74.0 million  . This   increase   was due to $60.1 million of purchases of marketable securities (net of sales) as well as the timing of capital expenditures to construct new domestic company-operated Shacks and, to a lesser extent, higher capital expenditures related to remodels and replacement equipment as our base of mature Shacks has grown.

     Table of Contents  

Financing Activities 
  For the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 28, 2016  , net cash provided by financing activities was   $0.2 million   compared to   $61.5 million   for the     thirty-nine weeks ended     September 30, 2015  ,     a     decrease   of $  61.3 million  . This decrease is primarily due to   $109.4 million   of net proceeds received from the IPO in the prior year, as well as decreases in payments on the Revolving Credit Facility of   $36.0 million   and member distributions of $9.5 million. These decreases were offset by   $2.1 million   in proceeds from employee stock option exercises. 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  We maintain a Revolving Credit Facility that provides for a revolving total commitment amount of   $50.0 million  , of which   $20.0 million   is available immediately. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable in February 2020. The Revolving Credit Facility permits the issuance of letters of credit upon our request of up to   $10.0 million  . Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either: (i) LIBOR plus a percentage ranging from   2.3%   to   3.3%   or (ii) the prime rate plus a percentage ranging from   0.0%   to   0.8%  , depending on the type of borrowing made under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of   September 28, 2016  , there were   no   amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We had   $19.9 million   of availability, as of   September 28, 2016  , after giving effect to   $0.1 million   in outstanding letters of credit.  
  The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of SSE Holdings and the guarantors. The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by each of SSE Holdings' wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (with certain exceptions). 
  The Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to, subject to specified exceptions, incur additional debt; incur additional liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve ourselves; pay dividends or make distributions; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains certain cross-default provisions. We are required to maintain a specified consolidated fixed-charge coverage ratio and a specified funded net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, both as defined under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of   September 28, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES                 

Our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations is based upon the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions, which we believe to be reasonable, based on the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Variances in the estimates or assumptions used to actual experience could yield materially different accounting results. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances.
