Forward-Lookin  g Statements   
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. You should not place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, cash flows, capital expenditures, the outcome of pending legal proceedings and claims, goals and objectives for future operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and purchase commitments from customers. These statements are typically identified by words such as  believe,   anticipate,   expect,   plan,   intend,   estimate,   should,   will  and similar expressions. We base these statements on particular assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience, as well as our perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider the information in this report, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, we cannot assure you that the results and events contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this report will in fact transpire.  
 You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this report because they identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statements. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly and may not meet our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors. The price of our stock would likely decline if this occurs. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:  

the loss of one or more significant customers, the loss of a significant platform with an automotive customer or the in-sourcing of certain services by our automotive customers;      

our ability to maintain a competitive technological advantage through innovation and leading product designs;     

our ability to maintain profitability if there are delays in our product launches or increased pricing pressure from our customers;     

fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the value of the U.S. Dollar and the Euro;     

the inability of our suppliers to deliver materials, parts and components including, without limitation, microchips and displays, at the scheduled rate and disruptions arising in connection therewith;      

fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials including, without limitation, petroleum, copper, steel, aluminum, synthetic resins, rare metals and rare-earth minerals, or shortages of materials, parts and components;      

our failure to protect the security of our products and systems against cyber crime; and     

our failure to maintain the value of our brands and implementing a sufficient brand protection program.      

 Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. As a result, the foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For additional information regarding certain factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those expected or anticipated see the information under the caption  Risk Factors  which is located in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement (except as required by law). This report also makes reference to our awarded business, which represents the estimated future lifetime net sales for all our automotive customers. Our awarded business does not represent firm customer orders. We report our awarded business primarily based on written award letters from our customers. To validate these awards, we use various assumptions including global vehicle production forecasts, customer take rates for our products, revisions to product life-cycle estimates and the impact of annual price reductions and exchange rates, among other factors. The term  take rate  represents the number of units sold by us divided by an estimate of the total number of vehicles of a specific vehicle line produced during the same timeframe. The assumptions we use to validate these awards are updated and reported externally on an annual basis.

 Basis of Presentation  
 References to  we,   us,   our,  the  company  and  Harman  refer to Harman International Industries, Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.  
 Our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies described in our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 (our  2016 Annual Report ) and do not include all information and footnote disclosures included in our audited financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals, necessary to present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2017 due to seasonal, economic and other factors.  
 Where necessary, information for prior periods has been reclassified to conform to the condensed consolidated financial statement presentation in the current fiscal year. We have identified an immaterial error in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. We have corrected this prior period immaterial error in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The correction impacted the financial statement line items Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities and the Effect of exchange rate changes on cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and resulted in a decrease in the Net change in derivative assets and liabilities and Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities in the amount of $40.1 million with an equal and offsetting decrease to the financial statement line item Effect of exchange rate changes on cash. There was no other impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our 2016 Annual Report.  
 Effective July 1, 2016, we revised our business segments in order to better align them with our strategic approach to the markets and customers we serve. Refer to Note 18    Business Segment Data  for more information. Prior period segment amounts throughout the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified to the new segment structure. The reclassification of historical business segment information had no impact on our basic financial statements.  
 The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ), have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

Note 2   New Accounting Standards  
 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  
 Imputation of Interest:  In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-15,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,  which clarifies the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lines of credit. Under the new guidance, these costs may be presented as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are outstanding borrowings on the arrangement. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. We adopted the provisions of this new guidance on July 1, 2016 on a retrospective basis.   The adoption of the new provisions did not have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which changes the presentation requirements for debt issuance costs and debt discount and premium. The new guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct  
 5 

deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurem  ent guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the new guidance. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that ha  ve not been previously issued. We adopted the provisions of this new guidance on July 1, 2016 on a retrospective basis.   The adoption of the new provisions resulted in a reclassification of $6.2 million which reduced both Other assets and Long-term debt in   our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The adoption of the new provision did not have any impact on our results of operations.  
 Extraordinary Items:  In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01,  Income Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20),  which eliminates the concept of extraordinary items. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2015. The new guidance is to be applied prospectively but may also be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We adopted the provisions of this new guidance on July 1, 2016.   The adoption of the new provisions did not have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards  
   Cash Flows:  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows: Clarification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which eliminates the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, by adding or clarifying guidance on eight specific cash flow issues.   The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. We expect to adopt the provisions of this new guidance on July 1, 2018. The provisions in this guidance will be applied on a retrospective basis. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of the new provisions will have on our statement of cash flows.  
 Share-Based Payments:  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which simplifies how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the consolidated financial statements. The guidance amends certain income tax consequences for share-based payments, the accounting for forfeitures, the classification of share-based awards, and the classification of share-based payments in the statement of cash flows.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. We expect to adopt the provisions of this new guidance on July 1, 2017. The provisions in this guidance will be applied on a prospective basis. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of the new provisions will have on our financial condition and results of operations.   
 Derivatives:  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships,  which clarifies existing guidance on the designation of hedging instruments. Under the new guidance, a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument would not require dedesignation of that hedging relationship, provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continues to be met. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. We expect to adopt the provisions of this new guidance on July 1, 2017. The provisions in this guidance can be applied on either a prospective basis or a modified retrospective basis. We do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.   
   
 Leases:  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),    which increases transparency and comparability by requiring a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification determining whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years   and interim periods within those years   beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted   for financial statements that have not been previously issued  .   We expect to adopt the provisions of this new guidance on July 1, 2019.   A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of the new provisions will have on our financial condition and results of operations.  
   
     Financial Instruments:  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses   (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,        which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.   The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. We expect to adopt the   
 6 

provisions of this new guidance on July 1, 2020.   We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of the new provisions will have on our financial condition and results of operations.  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments     Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which changes the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. It also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. Under the new guidance, equity investments (excluding those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation) will be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  For financial liabilities that an entity has elected to measure at fair value in accordance with the fair value option guidance, the amendments require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the change in fair value that results from a change in instrument-specific credit risk. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. We expect to adopt the provisions of this new guidance on July 1, 2018. We do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Inventory:  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11  ,    Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which states that inventory should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We expect to adopt the provisions of this new guidance on July 1, 2017. The new guidance should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of the new provisions will have on our financial condition and results of operations.   
 Revenue Recognition:  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  which amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards. The new guidance implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The new guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. ASU No. 2014-09, as amended by ASU No. 2015-14, ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, and ASU No. 2016-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We expect to adopt the provisions of this new guidance on July 1, 2018. Entities can transition to the new standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of the new provisions will have on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the method of adoption.   
   
 Revenue Recognition and Derivatives:  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11,  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting,   which rescinds certain SEC comments that are codified in Topic 605 and Topic 815.  These rescissions include changes to accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs, accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer, and accounting to determine the nature of a host contract related to a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share. ASU No. 2016-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We expect to adopt the provisions of this new guidance on July 1, 2018. We do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  

Note 3   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  
 We reserve an estimated amount for accounts receivable that may not be collected. Methodologies for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts are based primarily on specific identification of uncollectible accounts. Historical collection rates and customer credit worthiness are considered in determining specific reserves. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we had $19.5 million and $20.2 million, respectively, reserved for possible uncollectible accounts receivable.    

7 

Note 4   Inventories   
 At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, inventories consisted of the following:  

At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, our inventory reserves were $98.2 million and $93.9 million, respectively.  

Note 5   Property, Plant and Equipment, net  
 Property, plant and equipment, net consisted of the following:  

Depreciation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $35.7 million. 

Note 6   Accrued Warranties  
 Details of our accrued warranties are as follows:  

(1)    
 
 Other primarily represents foreign currency translation.     

Note 7   Earnings Per Share  
 We apply the two-class method when computing earnings per share, which requires that net income per share for each class of shares entitled to dividends be calculated assuming all of our net income is distributed as dividends to these shareholders based on their contractual rights.  
 8 

The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock outstanding:   

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are considered participating securities, as defined under GAAP, and are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.  
 Certain options were outstanding and not included in the computation of diluted net earnings per share because the assumed exercise of these options would have been antidilutive. Options to purchase 189,556 and 191,515 shares of our common stock at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were outstanding and were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as they would have been antidilutive. In addition, 320,586 and 263,066 restricted stock units at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were outstanding and were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as they also would have been antidilutive.  

Note 8   Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net  
 Goodwill  
 Goodwill was $1.511 billion at September 30, 2016 compared with $1.510 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase in goodwill in the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus June 30, 2016 was primarily associated with favorable foreign currency translation of $1.2 million partially offset by a decrease of $0.1 million in connection with the acquisition of TowerSec Ltd. ( TowerSec ).  
 As discussed in Note 18    Business Segment Data , we revised our segment and reporting unit structure effective July 1, 2016. Under this new structure, our Lifestyle Audio segment will now contain our car audio aftermarket services business which was previously included in our Connected Services segment. Our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments with the exception of Lifestyle Audio, which consists of two reporting units, car audio and consumer audio. In connection with this realignment, we reallocated our goodwill to our new reporting unit based on each reporting unit s relative fair value. We also performed a goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2016 using our new reporting units. We determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value and, as such, no impairments were deemed to exist as of this date.  
 The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows:  

(1)    
 
 The realignment adjustments reallocate our goodwill based on our new reporting structure based on the relative fair value of each reporting unit.     

(2    )    
 
 Refer to Note 22  Acquisitions  for more information.     

(3)    
 
 The other adjustments to goodwill primarily consist of foreign currency translation adjustments.

We did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     
 The contingent purchase price associated with the acquisition of innovative Systems GmbH ( IS ) is calculated pursuant to the terms of an agreement between the parties. Certain terms of the agreement are currently subject to a dispute between the parties and the matter has been submitted to arbitration. On November 5, 2013, the arbitration panel issued a partial award on some of the disputed matters covering the period from February 2009 through January 2012 awarding  16.3 million to the IS sellers. We contested the enforcement of the partial award. In July 2014, the partial award was upheld. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we paid the  16.3 million partial award.   
 On June 22, 2016, we executed an agreement with certain parties that previously owned 80.05% of IS (the  80.05% Shareholders ) to settle the remaining disputed matters with the 80.05% Shareholders that had been submitted to arbitration related to the contingent purchase price associated with our acquisition of IS. Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay the 80.05% Shareholders  76.8 million (the  IS Obligation ), with an initial payment of  24.8 million which was paid in July 2016 and four installment payments of  13 million due every July 1 st  from 2017 through 2020.  In fiscal year 2016, we recorded approximately $74.5 million of additional contingent purchase price for this IS Obligation as an increase to goodwill. The agreement includes an option that, if exercised by the 80.05% Shareholders, would require us to make selected installment payments early, subject to an eight percent discount rate.  The existence of this option effectively makes this obligation due on demand and it has therefore been included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in Current portion of long-term debt. Until such time as the disputed matters with the remaining shareholders that previously owned 19.95% of IS are resolved, we cannot calculate the contingent purchase price related to the acquisition of IS. Refer to Note 9  Debt  for more information. 
 Intangible Assets, Net  
 Net intangible assets were $461.8 million and $476.3 million at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, and were comprised of the following:  

(1)    
 
 Includes $55.7 million and $18.5 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the acquisition of AMX LLC and AMX Holding Corporation (collectively  AMX ) and Martin Professional A/S, respectively.     

 Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $15.5 million and $21.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Amortization expense in each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter is expected to approximate the following:

Note 9   Debt   
 Short Term Borrowings  
 At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 we had $1.2 million and $0 of short-term borrowings outstanding, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we maintained lines of credit of $53.3 million and $53.4 million, respectively, primarily in India, China, Brazil, Denmark and Israel.  
 We classify our debt based on the contractual maturity dates of the underlying debt instruments. We defer costs associated with debt issuance over the applicable term of the debt. These costs are amortized to Interest expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  
  Issuance of 2.000 Percent Senior Notes   
 On May 27, 2015, we completed a public offering of  350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Euro-denominated 2.000 percent Senior Notes due 2022 (the  2.000 Percent Senior Notes ), issued by Harman Finance International, S.C.A. ( Harman Finance ), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Harman. Harman Finance is a wholly-owned finance subsidiary and has no independent activities, assets or operations other than in connection with the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes. The 2.000 Percent Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.000 percent per year, payable annually in arrears on May 27 of each year, commencing on May 27, 2016 and will mature on May 27, 2022. The 2.000 Percent Senior Notes were issued at 99.613 percent of par value, reflecting a discount of  1.4 million to the aggregate principal amount, which is being amortized to Interest expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income using the effective interest method, over the term of the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes. We incurred  2.6 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes which are being amortized to Interest expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income using the effective interest method, over the term of the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2.000 Percent Notes were  346.0 million, net of the discount and debt issuance costs. The effective interest related to the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes, based on the net proceeds received is 2.060 percent. The 2.000 Percent Senior Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of May 27, 2015, by and between Harman Finance, Harman, as guarantor, and a trustee, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated as of May 27, 2015, by and among Harman Finance, Harman, as guarantor, and a trustee (as supplemented, the  2.000 Percent Senior Notes Indenture ). All payments of interest and principal, including payments made upon any redemption of the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes, will be made in Euros, subject to certain exceptions if the Euro is unavailable.  
  Issuance of 4.150 Percent Senior Notes   
 On May 11, 2015, we completed a public offering of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of U.S. Dollar denominated 4.150 Percent Senior Notes due 2025 (the  4.150 Percent Senior Notes ) issued by Harman. The 4.150 Percent Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.150 percent per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2015, and will mature on May 15, 2025. The 4.150 Percent Senior Notes were issued at 99.336 percent of par value, reflecting a discount of $2.7 million to the aggregate principal amount, which is being amortized to Interest expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income using the effective interest method, over the term of the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes. We incurred $3.8 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes which are being amortized to Interest expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income using the effective interest method, over the term of the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes were $393.5 million, net of the discount and debt issuance costs. The effective interest related to the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes, based on the net proceeds received is 4.232 percent. The 4.150 Percent Senior Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of May 11, 2015, by and between Harman and a trustee, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated as of May 11, 2015, by and between Harman and a trustee (as supplemented, the  4.150 Percent Senior Notes Indenture ).  
  2015 Credit Agreement   
 On March 26, 2015 we and our wholly-owned subsidiary Harman Holding GmbH   Co. KG ( Harman KG ), entered into a Multi-Currency Credit Agreement with a group of banks (the  2015 Credit Agreement ). The 2015 Credit Agreement provides for a five-year unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility in the amount of $1.2 billion (the  Aggregate Commitment ) with availability in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar of up to $750.0 million. Up to $50.0 million of the Aggregate Commitment is available for letters of credit. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the 2015 Credit Agreement, the Aggregate Commitment may be increased by up to $500.0 million. However, there is presently no commitment for this additional borrowing ability. We may select interest rates for borrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement equal to (i) the LIBO rate plus an applicable margin, (ii) the EURIBO rate plus an applicable margin, or (iii) a base rate plus an applicable margin, which in each case is based on ratings which are established by Standard   Poor s Ratings Services ( S P ) and Moody s Investor Services ( Moody s ). We pay a facility fee on the Aggregate Commitment, whether drawn or undrawn, which is also determined based on our ratings which are established by S P and Moody s.  
 11 

At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, there was approximately $483.0 million and $523.0   million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings, which are included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as Borrowings under revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 there were $4.1 million of outstanding letters of cred  it under the 2015 Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, unused available credit under the 2015 Credit Agreement was $712.9 million and $672.9 million, respectively. In connection with the 2015 Credit Agreement, we incurred $3.0 million   of fees and other expenses which are being amortized over the term of the 2015 Credit Agreement to Interest expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis.   
  IS Obligation  
 On June 22, 2016, we executed an agreement with the 80.05% Shareholders to settle with them the disputed matters related to the contingent purchase price associated with our acquisition of IS that had been submitted to arbitration. Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay the IS Obligation in accordance with the following schedule: an initial payment of  24.8 million which was paid in July 2016 and four installment payments of  13 million due every July 1 st  from 2017 through 2020. The agreement includes an option that, if exercised by the 80.05% Shareholders, would require us to make selected installment payments early, subject to an eight percent discount rate.  The existence of this option effectively makes this obligation due on demand and it has therefore been included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in Current portion of long-term debt. Until such time as the disputed matters with the remaining shareholders that previously owned 19.95% of IS are resolved, we cannot calculate the contingent purchase price related to the IS acquisition. Refer to Note 8- Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net  for more information. 
 At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, total debt consisted of the following:  

(1)    
 
    The estimated fair value of the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes and the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes were based on a broker quotation (Level 2). Under fair value accounting guidance, Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.      

(2)    
 
    Amounts due under the IS Obligation have been recorded at their present value and will be accreted to the ultimate settlement amount through the effective-interest method (Level 2).  We are required to make payments of  13 million due every July 1 st  from 2017 through 2020.  Because the IS Obligation has an option, which if exercised requires us to make selected installment payments on demand, it has been included as Current portion of long-term debt.  Refer to Note 8-  Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net   for more information.     

 At September 30, 2016, total debt maturing in each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter is as follows:  

12 

Our existing debt agreements contain provisions that limit our operating and financing activities. The 2015 Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to permit certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt   and the ability of us and our subsidiaries to incur liens, make fundamental changes (including selling all or substantially all of our assets), undertake transactions with affiliates and undertake sale and leaseback transactions. The 2.000 Percent Senior   Notes Indenture and the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes Indenture contain covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to incur indebtedness secured by principal properties, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to   principal properties and enter into certain mergers, consolidations and transfers of all or substantially all of the assets of Harman. In addition, the 2015 Credit Agreement contains more restrictive financial covenants that require us to maintain complian  ce with specified financial ratios. We may have to curtail some of our operations to maintain compliance with the covenants in our existing debt agreements. A violation of any of these covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which co  uld permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of any borrowings outstanding and/or the holders of the notes to direct the trustee to accelerate repayment of amounts outstanding under the notes. A default or acceleration under our debt agreements would   result in increased capital costs and could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations and financial condition. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the 2015 Credit   Agreement, the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes Indenture and the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes Indenture.   
 Interest expense is reported net of interest income in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest expense, net was $9.3 million and $8.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross interest expense was $10.2 million and $8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The non-cash portion of gross interest expense was $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The cash portion of gross interest expense was $9.5 million and $8.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest income was $0.9 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Non-cash interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 relates to the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs on the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes and the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes and the amortization of debt issuance costs on the 2015 Credit Agreement.  
 Cash interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily relates to interest on the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes, the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes, and the 2015 Credit Agreement. 
 Cash interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily relates to interest on the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes, the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes, the 2015 Credit Agreement and our short-term borrowings.  
 Interest income primarily relates to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the variances from year to year are due to fluctuations in those balances and changes in interest rates.  

Note 10   Income Taxes  
 Our provision for income taxes is based on an estimated annual tax rate for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $37.4 million and $33.5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 26.8 percent and 27.7 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to income mix and rate differentials between the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. 
 As of September 30, 2016 unrecognized tax benefits and the related interest were $65.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively, all of which would affect the tax rate if recognized. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, $0.4 million of tax reserves were established on new uncertain tax positions. Related interest on prior year exposures was increased by $0.1 million. 
   
 We periodically reevaluate the recognition and measurement threshold of our uncertain tax positions based on new or additional evidence such as tax authority administrative pronouncements, rulings and court decisions. The ultimate settlement however, may be materially different from the amount accrued. Our significant jurisdictions that are under examination are Germany, Austria and the U.S. The examination by the German revenue authorities for fiscal years 2005 through 2010 is closed, with the exception of one remaining issue that will proceed to the fiscal authority and court. In addition, the German revenue authorities notified us that the examination for fiscal years 2011 to 2014 will commence during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Austria was recently notified that the examination for fiscal years 2011 to 2014 will commence during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. The tax years currently under examination by the United States Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) are fiscal years 2014 and 2015 for Harman and fiscal years 2010 to 2012 for Harman Connected Services Holding Corp. (fka Symphony Teleca Corporation). We do not expect these examinations to be closed for at least the next 12 months. Fiscal years 2006 to 2008 (and 2012 to 2013 for any rollforward adjustments) for Harman are currently in the IRS Appeals process and are awaiting resolution.  
   
 13 

Although the final resolution of the examinations and appeals is uncertain, we believe that the ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on our Condensed Consol  idated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income or our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. While we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change, we are unable to quantify the change at this time.    

Note 11   Shareholders  Equity  
 Preferred Stock 
 As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we had no shares of preferred stock outstanding. We are authorized to issue 5 million shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value.  
 Common Stock  
 We have 200 million authorized shares of common stock, $0.01 par value. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we had 101,492,917 and 101,157,320 shares issued; 31,563,678 and 31,112,246 shares in treasury stock; and 69,929,239 and 70,045,074 shares outstanding (net of treasury stock), respectively.  
 Share Buyback Program  
 On October 28, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of our common stock over a three year period (the  2014 Buyback Program ). The 2014 Buyback Program allows us to purchase shares of our common stock in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions during the authorized three year period. The 2014 Buyback Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We will determine the timing and the amount of any repurchases based on an evaluation of market conditions, share price, other growth opportunities and other factors. We have and may repurchase shares on the open market or, from time to time, through repurchase plans with one or more external brokers that provide a structure for execution of share repurchases under the 2014 Buyback Program. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 451,432   shares and 370,700, respectively, at a cost of $35.2 million and $37.1 million, respectively, for a total cumulative buyback of 2,083,180   shares at a cost of $175.2 million under the 2014 Buyback Program.  
 Changes in Equity:  
 The following is a summary of the changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) and changes in equity for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

14 

Note 12   Share-Based Compensation  
 On December 7, 2011 (the  Effective Date ), our shareholders approved the 2012 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the  2012 Plan ), which is effective through December 7, 2021. As of the Effective Date, no further grants may be granted under our former plan, the Amended and Restated 2002 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as amended (the  2002 Plan  and together with the 2012 Plan, the  Plans ). On December 4, 2013, we amended the 2012 Plan to (i) increase the number of shares available under the 2012 Plan for the grant of future awards by 2,869,821 shares to an aggregate amount not to exceed 7,269,821 shares of our common stock and (ii) modified certain share counting provisions related to the definition of a full-value grant from 1.71 to 1.5 ( Full-Value Grant ). On December 9, 2015, we further amended the 2012 Plan to increase the number of shares available under the 2012 Plan for the grant of future awards by 2,000,000 shares to an aggregate amount not to exceed 9,269,821 shares of our common stock. The 2012 Plan provides for two types of awards: (i) a Full-Value Grant under which one award shall reduce the shares available for grant under the 2012 Plan by 1.71 shares if granted prior to December 4, 2013 or 1.5 shares if granted on or after December 4, 2013, and (ii) an option or stock appreciation right grant, under which one award shall reduce the shares available for grant under the 2012 Plan by one share. Shares may be issued as original issuances, treasury shares or a combination of both. Option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant. The option awards generally vest over three to five years of continuous service commencing one year from the date of the grant and expire after ten years. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, 911,956 stock-settled restricted stock units, 6,136 cash-settled restricted stock units and 1,853 cash-settled stock appreciation rights were granted under the 2012 Plan. As of September 30, 2016, there were 3,838,141 shares available for grant under the 2012 Plan.  
 Share-based compensation expense, net was $10.2 million and $8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for share-based compensation arrangements was $2.3 million and $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 15 

Fair Value Determination   
 Stock Options 
 The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. There were no options granted during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
 Groups of option holders (directors, executives and non-executives) that have similar historical behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. Expected volatilities are based on historical closing prices of our common stock over the expected option term. We use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted is derived using the option valuation model and represents the estimated period of time from the date of grant that the option is expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  
 Stock Option Activity  
 A summary of option activity under the Plans as of September 30, 2016 and changes during the three months ended September 30, 2016 is presented below:  

The total intrinsic value of options exercised for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively. 
 Modification of Certain Stock Option Awards  
 Prior to fiscal year 2011, certain of the award agreements under the 2002 Plan stated that vested options not exercised were forfeited upon termination of employment for any reason other than death or disability. However, such award agreements provided that the Compensation and Option Committee of our Board of Directors (the  Compensation and Option Committee ) could extend the time period to exercise vested options 90 days beyond the employment termination date for certain employees. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Compensation and Option Committee used this authority. This action represented a modification of the terms or conditions of an equity award and therefore was accounted for as an exchange of the original award for a new award. Incremental share-based compensation cost for the excess of the fair value of the new award over the fair value of the original award was immaterial.  
 Restricted Stock Units  
 In the three months ended September 30, 2016, we granted 210,476 restricted stock units with earnings per share ( EPS ) performance conditions, and 210,476 restricted stock units with market conditions under the 2012 Plan. Additionally, both the restricted stock units with EPS performance conditions and the restricted stock units with market conditions secondarily vest based on the achievement of a return on invested capital ( ROIC ) performance condition, specifically, the achievement of a certain average ROIC level over fiscal years 2017 through 2019. The restricted stock units with EPS performance conditions cliff vest three years from the date of grant based on the achievement of certain cumulative EPS levels from fiscal years 2017 through 2019. The restricted stock units with market conditions cliff vest three years from the date of grant based on a comparison of our total shareholder return ( TSR ) to the TSR of a selected peer group of publicly listed multinational companies. The grant date fair value of the restricted stock units with market conditions of $11.4 million was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the three-year vesting period based on the grant date fair value and our assessment of the probability that the applicable targets will be met for the performance conditions, which is reassessed each reporting period.  
 In the three months ended September 30, 2015, we granted 174,676 restricted stock units with EPS performance conditions and 174,676 restricted stock units with market conditions under the 2012 Plan. Additionally, both the restricted stock units with EPS  
 16 

performance conditions and the restricted stock units with market conditions secondarily vest based on the achievement of a ROIC performance condition, specifically, the achievement of a cert  ain average ROIC level over fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The restricted stock units with EPS performance conditions cliff vest three years from the date of grant based on the achievement of certain cumulative EPS levels from fiscal years 2016 through 20  18. The restricted stock units with market conditions cliff vest three years from the date of grant based on a comparison of our TSR to the TSR of a selected peer group of publicly listed multinational companies. The grant date fair value of the restricted   stock units with market conditions of $12.3 million was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the three-year vesting period based on the grant date fair value and our assessment of the probability   that the applicable targets will be met for the performance conditions, which is reassessed each reporting period.   
 In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, we granted 130,616 restricted stock units with EPS performance conditions and 130,641 restricted stock units with market conditions under the 2012 Plan. These restricted stock units cliff-vested in September 2016. Compensation expense, for both the restricted stock units with performance conditions and the restricted stock units with market conditions, was recognized ratably over the three-year vesting period based on the grant date fair value and our assessment of the probability that the applicable targets would be met, for awards with performance conditions. Of the restricted stock units with EPS performance conditions, 100 percent vested and of the restricted stock units with market conditions 78 percent vested based on the actual attainment of certain targets.  
  In the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we also granted 6,830 and 5,243 time-vested restricted stock units, respectively, without performance or market conditions, that cliff-vest three years from the date of grant, 484,174 and 324,987 time-vested restricted stock units, respectively, without performance or market conditions that vest ratably over the three-year vesting period, and 0 and 294 time-vested restricted stock units, respectively, without performance or market conditions, that cliff-vest one year from the date of grant, under the 2012 Plan.  
 In the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we granted 6,136 and 4,923 cash-settled restricted stock units, respectively, under the 2012 Plan. These restricted stock units are accounted for as liability awards and are recorded at the fair value at the end of the reporting period in accordance with their vesting schedules. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 2,268 and 869 cash-settled restricted stock units were settled, respectively. At September 30, 2016, 10,260 cash-settled restricted stock units were outstanding.  
 A summary of equity classified restricted stock unit activity as of September 30, 2016 and changes during the three months ended September 30, 2016 is presented below:  

At September 30, 2016, the aggregate intrinsic value of equity-classified restricted stock units was $158.5 million and there was $111.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to equity classified restricted stock unit compensation arrangements. The weighted average recognition period was 2.3 years.  
 Stock Appreciation Rights  
 A summary of cash-settled stock appreciation rights as of September 30, 2016 and changes during the three months ended September 30, 2016 is presented below:  

17 

These stock appreciation rights are accounted for as liability awards and are recorded at the fair value at the end of the reporting period in accordance with their vesting schedules. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which uses the assumptions noted below. 

Note 13   Derivatives  
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financial activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. These derivative instruments are utilized to hedge economic exposures, as well as to reduce volatility in earnings and cash flows resulting from shifts in market rates. We enter into limited types of derivative contracts including foreign currency spot and forward, as well as interest rate swap contracts, to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Our primary foreign currency exposure is the Euro. The fair market values of all our derivative contracts change with fluctuations in interest rates and currency rates and are designed so that any changes in their values are offset by changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Derivative financial instruments are held solely as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes.  
 We record all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain of these derivative contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges, whereby gains and losses are reported within AOCI in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the underlying transaction occurs, at which point they are reported in earnings as gains and losses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain of our derivatives, for which hedge accounting is not applied, are effective as economic hedges. These derivative contracts are required to be recognized each period at fair value, with gains and losses reported in earnings in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and therefore do result in some level of earnings volatility. The level of volatility will vary with the type and amount of derivative hedges outstanding, as well as fluctuations in the currency and interest rate markets during the period. The related cash flow impacts of all our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.  
 Derivatives, by their nature, involve varying degrees of market and credit risk. The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange and interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. We do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments, because these transactions are executed with a diversified group of major financial institutions. Furthermore, our policy is to contract only with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating. Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposure to such counterparties.  
  Foreign Exchange Risk Management   
 We use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the price risk associated with foreign denominated forecasted purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process and to manage currency risk associated with operating costs in certain operating units, including foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and other foreign currency denominated assets. These contracts generally mature in the next two to three years. The majority of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.  
 18 

At   September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts, primarily forward contracts, which are summarized below:   

(1)    
 
  Represents the net receivable included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets within Other current assets, Other assets, Accrued liabilities and Other non-current liabilities, as applicable.      

  Cash Flow Hedges   
 We designate a portion of our foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated purchases. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we had $1.450 billion and $1.608 billion of forward contracts maturing through October 2019. These contracts are recorded at fair value in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The changes in fair value for these contracts are calculated on a forward-to-forward rate basis. These changes in fair value are reported in AOCI and are reclassified to either Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ), depending on the nature of the underlying asset or liability that is being hedged, in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, in the period or periods during which the underlying transaction occurs.  
 Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items because the amounts and the maturities of the derivatives approximate those of the forecasted exposures. Any ineffective portion of the derivative is recognized in the current period in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, in the same line item in which the foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying hedged transaction was recorded. We recognized $0.2 million and $0 of ineffectiveness in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the fair values of these contracts were net assets of $110.4 million and $131.9 million, respectively. The amount associated with these hedges that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI to earnings within the next 12 months is a gain of $74.6 million.  
  Economic Hedges   
 When hedge accounting is not applied to derivative contracts, or after former cash flow hedges have been de-designated as balance sheet hedges, we recognize the gain or loss on the associated contracts directly in  current period  earnings in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as either Foreign exchange gains, net, Cost of sales, or SG A according  to the underlying exposu re. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we had $291.5 million and $419.1 million, respectively, of forward contracts maturing through May 2022 in various currencies to hedge foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and other foreign currency denominated assets. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the fair values of these contracts were net assets of $10.7 million and $7.4 million, respectively. Adjustments to the carrying value of the foreign currency forward contracts offset the gains and losses on the underlying loans and other foreign denominated assets in Foreign exchange gains, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Interest Rate Risk Manag  ement   
  Interest Rate Lock   
 In May 2015, we entered into an interest rate lock on the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes. The interest rate lock was used to protect the interest rate on the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes between the time the lock was initiated and the time the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes were issued, therefore eliminating any interest rate risk leading up to the bond issuance. We recognized $0.1 million in AOCI which is being amortized into Interest expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income over the term of the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes.  
 The following tables provide a summary of the fair value amounts of our derivative instruments as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016:

Note 14   Fair Value Measurements  
 Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurements, fair value is defined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which the asset or liability would transact in and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.  
  Fair Value Hierarchy   
 Under fair value accounting guidance, there is a three-tier fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions.  
 The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels are defined as follows:  

Level 1:   
 
 Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for the identical asset or liability.    

Level 2:   
 
 Inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.    

Level 3:   
 
 Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity s own assumptions in measuring the asset or liability at fair value.    

  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis   
 For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets and liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, and in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date.  
 The following table provides the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis.  

21 

The following describes the valuation methodologies we use to measure assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis:  
 Available-for-Sale Securities:  Available-for-sale securities are classified as Level 1 when the fair value is determined from market quotes obtained from financial institutions in active markets. Available-for-sale securities are classified as Level 3 when relevant observable inputs for a security are not available.  
 In August 2016, the Company purchased a convertible debt security issued by a nonpublic entity for $15.0 million and has classified the security as available-for-sale.  This available-for-sale debt security is measured at fair value each reporting period, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company measures its fair value using an income approach that incorporates probability-weighted outcomes.  The Company has classified this investment as Level 3 due to the lack of observable market data over fair value inputs such as the fair value of the nonmarketable equity shares underlying the conversion option. Changes in the estimated fair value of the nonmarketable equity shares underlying the conversion option contribute to changes in the fair value of the available-for-sale debt security.  Additionally, updated estimates of the assessed likelihood of a default by the issuer contribute to changes in the fair value of the available-for-sale debt security  As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of this available-for-sale debt security was $15.0 million.   The contractual maturity date is August 18, 2018.  
 Foreign Exchange Contracts:  We use foreign exchange contracts to hedge market risks relating to possible adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our foreign exchange contracts were measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs. Such inputs include foreign currency exchange spot and forward rates for similar transactions in actively quoted markets.   
 Pension Assets:  Our pension assets have been valued using Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in an active market exist for these assets. Refer to Note 17   Retirement Benefits   for more information.   
 Contingent Consideration:  At September 30, 2016,   a portion of our contingent consideration is associated with an earn-out related to the acquisition of TowerSec. We   use a Monte Carlo simulation model (a form of the income approach) in determining   the fair value of the contingent consideration  . The principal inputs to the approach include   our expectations of   the   achievement of certain targets   for awarded business   through March 10, 2019  , risk-free rates, volatility, credit spreads, and the weighted average cost of capital  .  At June 30, 2016, our estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration liability was $27.7 million.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we reconfirmed our estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration liability.  
 A portion of our contingent consideration is associated with a $30.0 million earn-out related to the acquisition of Redbend Ltd ( Redbend ). We use a discounted cash flow approach (a form of the income approach) in determining the fair value of the contingent consideration. The principal inputs to the approach include our expectations of the achievement of Redbend s cumulative bookings target for awarded business from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and a discount rate that begins with our weighted average cost of capital and adjusts for the risks associated with the underlying cumulative bookings target for awarded business outcome, the functional form of the payout and our credit risk associated with making the payment.   At June 30, 2016, our estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration liability was $18.4 million.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we revised our estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration liability to $30.0 million.  
 A portion of our contingent consideration is associated with a $10.0 million earn-out related to the acquisition of Southern Vision Systems, Inc. ( SVSI ). We use a discounted cash flow approach (a form of the income approach) in determining the fair value of the contingent consideration. The principal input to the approach is our expectation of the achievement of SVSI s contribution margin targets related to the sale of certain products through June 30, 2018. At June 30, 2016, our estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration liability was $3.0 million.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we made a payment of approximately $2.1 million related to fiscal year 2016 results.  We also reconfirmed our $0.9 million estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration liability as of September 30, 2016. 
 A portion of our contingent consideration is associated with an earn-out related to our acquisition of Duran Audio BV ( Duran ). We use a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach (a form of the income approach) in determining the fair value of the contingent consideration. The principal inputs to the approach include our expectations of Duran s gross profit related to the sale of certain specified products through June 30, 2020 and a discount rate that begins with our weighted average cost of capital and adjusts for the risks associated with the underlying Duran gross profit outcome, the functional form of the payout and our credit risk associated with making the payment.   At June 30, 2016, our estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration liability was $1.6   
 22 

million.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we made a payment of approximately $0.1 million related to fiscal year 2016 results.  We also reconfirmed our $1.5 million estimate of the fair val  ue of this contingent consideration liability as of September 30, 2016.  
 A portion of our contingent consideration is associated with an earn-out related to the acquisition of I.P.S.G International Product Solution Group Pty Ltd. and VFX Systems Pty Ltd. (collectively  IPSG/VFX ). We determined the fair value of the contingent consideration based on our expectations of IPSG/VFX s gross profit related to the sale of certain specified products through June 30, 2017 .  At June 30, 2016, our estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration liability was $0.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we reconfirmed our estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration liability.  
 Given the use of significant inputs that are not observable in the market, our contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 22  Acquisitions  for more information.  
 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis  
 Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. These assets can include long-lived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale or impaired, goodwill that has been reduced to fair value when it is impaired, cost and equity method investments and the remeasurement of retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in deconsolidation of a subsidiary if we sell a controlling interest and retain a noncontrolling stake in the entity. Assets that are written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.  
 The following table provides the carrying value for assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis, all of which are measured under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, and the losses recorded during the periods presented. There were no gains or losses recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

The following describes the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  
 Equity Method Investments:  Equity method investments are generally valued using a discounted cash flow model, comparative market multiples or a combination of both approaches as appropriate. These investments are generally included in Level 3.   
 Goodwill:  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. This asset is included in Level 3. Refer to Note 8   Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net   for more information.   
 Long-lived Assets:  Long-lived assets include Property, plant and equipment, net and intangible assets, and are valued using the best information available, including quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets when available or internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate or independent appraisals, as appropriate. For real estate, cash flow estimates are based on current market estimates that reflect current and projected lease profiles and available industry information about expected trends in rental, occupancy and capitalization rates. These assets are generally included in Level 3.

24 

At September 30, 2016, we   had approximately $9.0 million and $62.4 million of investments included in Other current assets and Non-current assets, respectively, in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets that have been classified as available-for-sale securities. At June 30, 201  6, we had approximately $8.9 million and $45.6 million of investments included in Other current assets and Non-current assets, respectively, in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets that have been classified as available-for-sale securities. These secu  rities are recorded at fair value with realized gains and losses recorded in income and unrealized gains and losses recorded in AOCI, net of taxes.   

Note 16   Restructuring Program  
 Our restructuring program that is designed to improve our global footprint, cost structure, technology portfolio, human resources and internal processes continues. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we continued to refine existing programs and launched significant new programs focused on achieving further productivity improvements to: (i) optimize certain research and development, supply chain and administrative functions; (ii) outsource certain manufacturing capabilities; (iii) divest or sublease facilities no longer needed to support current operations; and (iv) relocate certain functions to best cost countries.  
 A summary and components of our restructuring initiatives are presented below and include accruals for new programs as well as revisions to estimates, both increases and decreases, to programs accrued in prior periods:  

(1)    
 
 Credits related to restructuring charges for accelerated depreciation and inventory provisions are recorded against the related assets in Property, plant and equipment, net or Inventories in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and do not impact the restructuring liability.     

(2)    
 
 Restructuring expenses noted above are primarily in SG A in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Asset impairments which consist of accelerated depreciation and inventory provisions are primarily in Cost of sales in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.     

 Restructuring liabilities are recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other non-current liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
 Restructuring expenses by reporting business segment are presented below:

Note 17   Retirement Benefits   
 Plan Descriptions  
 Retirement savings plan  
 We provide a Retirement Savings Plan (the  Savings Plan ) for certain employees in the United States. Under the Savings Plan, and subject to certain limitations: (i) employees may contribute up to 50 percent of their pretax compensation; (ii) each business unit will make a safe harbor non-elective contribution in an amount equal to three percent of a participant s pre-tax compensation; and (iii) each business unit may also make a matching contribution of 50 percent of an employee s tax-deferred compensation, up to the first six percent of a participant s pre-tax compensation. Matching contributions vest at a rate of 25 percent for each year of service with the employer, beginning with the second year of service.  
 Pension benefits  
 We provide defined pension benefits to certain eligible employees. The measurement date used for determining pension benefits is the last day of our fiscal year, June 30  th  . We have certain business units in Europe and Asia that maintain defined benefit pension plans for many of our current and former employees. The coverage provided and the extent to which the retirees  share in the cost of the program vary by business unit. Generally, plan benefits are based on age, years of service and average compensation during the final years of service. In the United States, we have a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the  SERP ) that provides retirement, death and termination benefits, as defined in the SERP, to certain key executives designated by our Board of Directors. The majority of our defined benefit plans do not have contractual or statutory provisions which specify minimum funding requirements. We are in compliance with all existing contractual obligations and statutory provisions.  
 The SERP is an unfunded plan for tax purposes and under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ) all obligations arising under the SERP are payable from our general assets. To assist in the funding of the benefits under the SERP, we maintain assets in an irrevocable trust whereby the use of these assets is restricted to funding our future benefit obligations under the SERP. These assets are not plan assets of the SERP, therefore, in the event of bankruptcy, the assets become unrestricted and the SERP would become a general creditor of our company. The assets and liabilities, and earnings and expenses, of the irrevocable trust are consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, there were $94.7 million and $92.7 million, respectively, of total assets included in the irrevocable trust of which $0.1 million in each period consisted of Cash and cash equivalents, $41.0 million and $40.8 million, respectively, consisted of the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and $53.6 million and $51.8 million, respectively, consisted of equity and fixed income mutual funds, which are classified as available-for-sale securities.  
 The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit cost for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we made contributions of $2.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively, to the defined benefit pension plans which were paid to participants.  We expect to make approximately $7.7 million in contributions for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.  

Note 18   Business Segment Data  
 Effective July 1, 2016, we revised our business segments in order to better align them with our strategic approach to the markets and customers we serve. Prior period segment amounts throughout the condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to the new segment structure. The reclassification of historical business segment information had no impact on our basic financial statements.  
 The accounting principles applied at the operating segment level in determining income (loss) from operations are the same as those applied at the consolidated financial statement level. Goodwill was allocated to our segments based on the relative fair value of the

 At September 30, 2016, we were subject to legal claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including the matter described below. The outcome of this legal action cannot be predicted with certainty; however, management, based upon advice from legal counsel, believes such action is either without merit or will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  
  In re Harman International Industries, Inc. Securities Litigation   
 On October 1, 2007, a purported class action lawsuit was filed by Cheolan Kim (the  Kim Plaintiff ) against Harman and certain of our officers in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the  Court ) seeking compensatory damages and costs on behalf of all persons who purchased our common stock between April 26, 2007 and September 24, 2007 (the  Class Period ). The original complaint alleged claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  
 The complaint alleged that the defendants omitted to disclose material adverse facts about Harman s financial condition and business prospects. The complaint contended that had these facts not been concealed at the time the merger agreement with Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts   Co. and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners was entered into, there would not have been a merger agreement, or it would have been at a much lower price, and the price of our common stock therefore would not have been artificially inflated during the Class Period. The Kim Plaintiff alleged that, following the reports that the proposed merger was not going to be completed, the price of our common stock declined, causing the plaintiff class significant losses.  
 On November 30, 2007, the Boca Raton General Employees  Pension Plan filed a purported class action lawsuit against Harman and certain of our officers in the Court seeking compensatory damages and costs on behalf of all persons who purchased our common stock between April 26, 2007 and September 24, 2007. The allegations in the Boca Raton complaint are essentially identical to the allegations in the original Kim complaint, and like the original Kim complaint, the Boca Raton complaint alleges claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  
 On January 16, 2008, the Kim Plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint, which extended the Class Period through January 11, 2008, contended that, in addition to the violations alleged in the original complaint, Harman also violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by  knowingly failing to disclose  significant problems  relating to its PND sales forecasts, production, pricing, and inventory  prior to January 14, 2008. The amended complaint claimed that when  Defendants revealed for the first time on January 14, 2008 that shifts in PND sales would adversely impact earnings per share by more than $1.00 per share in fiscal 2008,  that led to a further decline in our share value and additional losses to the plaintiff class.  
 On February 15, 2008, the Court ordered the consolidation of the Kim action with the Boca Raton action, the administrative closing of the Boca Raton action, and designated the short caption of the consolidated action as In re Harman International Industries, Inc. Securities Litigation, civil action no. 1:07-cv-01757 (RWR). That same day, the Court appointed the Arkansas Public Retirement System as lead plaintiff ( Lead Plaintiff ) and approved the law firm Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld and Toll, P.L.L.C. to serve as lead counsel.  
 On May 2, 2008, Lead Plaintiff filed a consolidated class action complaint (the  Consolidated Complaint ). The Consolidated Complaint, which extended the Class Period through February 5, 2008, contended that Harman and certain of our officers and directors violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing false and  
 29 

misleading disclosures regarding our financial condition in fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 200  8. In particular, the Consolidated Complaint alleged that defendants knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose material adverse facts about MyGIG radios, personal navigation devices and our capital expenditures. The Consolidated Complaint alleged that whe  n Harman s true financial condition became known to the market, the price of our common stock declined significantly, causing losses to the plaintiff class.   
 On July 3, 2008, defendants moved to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint in its entirety. Lead Plaintiff opposed the defendants  motion to dismiss on September 2, 2008, and defendants filed a reply in further support of their motion to dismiss on October 2, 2008.  
 On April 12, 2012, In re Harman International Industries, Inc. Securities Litigation, civil action no. 1:07-cv-01757 (D.D.C.) was reassigned to Judge Rudolph Contreras. 
 On September 5, 2012, the Court heard oral arguments on defendants  motion to dismiss. At the request of the Court, on September 24, 2012, each side submitted a supplemental briefing on defendants  motion to dismiss. On January 17, 2014, the Court granted a motion to dismiss, without prejudice.  The Lead Plaintiff appealed this ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the  Court of Appeals ) and, on June 23, 2015, the District Court s ruling was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. On July 23, 2015, the defendants filed a motion for a rehearing en banc before the Court of Appeals, which was denied on August 26, 2015. The defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking U.S. Supreme Court review on November 24, 2015, which was denied on February 29, 2016. Discovery in this matter is ongoing.  
  Connected Car Supply Arrangements   
 We have arrangements with our Connected Car customers to provide products that meet predetermined technical specifications and delivery dates. In the event that we do not satisfy the performance obligations under these arrangements, we may be required to indemnify the customer. We accrue for any loss that we expect to incur under these arrangements when that loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.9 million of costs relating to delayed delivery of product to a Connected Car customer and $3.9 million of gains related to losses we no longer expect to incur, respectively. An inability to meet performance obligations on connected car platforms to be delivered in future periods could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition in future periods.

The total cost of the TowerSec Acquisition was allocated on a preliminary basis, subject to final allocation, to the assets acquired and liabilities as  sumed based on their fair values at the TowerSec Acquisition Date, as follows:   

Based on our preliminary valuation, goodwill and intangibles were recorded in connection with the TowerSec Acquisition based on third-party valuations and management s estimates for those acquired intangible assets. The valuation of the acquired net assets is subject to change as we obtain additional information for our estimates during the measurement period. The primary areas of those purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to identifiable intangible assets and residual goodwill. Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets include internally developed technology of $4.6 million with an approximate useful life of six years. Expenses of $0.6 million were recognized in connection with this acquisition and are included in SG A in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The operating results of TowerSec are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the TowerSec Acquisition Date within our Connected Car segment.

Note 23   Accounts Payable   
 Beginning in fiscal year 2015, we entered into an agreement with a third party to provide an accounts payable tracking system which allows participating suppliers to sell our payment obligations to designated third-party financial institutions. Participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, make offers to sell one or more of our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates, at a discounted price, to participating financial institutions. Our goal in entering into this agreement is to capture overall supplier savings, in the form of pricing and payment terms, created by facilitating the supplier s ability to sell payment obligations, while providing them with greater working capital flexibility. We have no economic interest in the sale of these suppliers  receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by a supplier s decision to sell amounts under this arrangement; however, our right to offset balances due from suppliers against payment obligations is restricted by this agreement for those payment obligations that have been sold by suppliers. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, $399.1 million and $316.6 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations had been placed in the accounts payable tracking system, and participating suppliers had sold $179.8 million and $149.6 million, respectively, of those payment obligations to participating financial institutions.

Item 2.   
 
        Management s Discu    ssion and Analysis of   Financial Condition and Results of Operations      

 General  
 Effective July 1, 2016, we revised our business segments in order to better align them with our strategic approach to the markets and customers we serve. Our car audio aftermarket services business, which had previously been included within our Connected Services segment, is now included in our Lifestyle Audio segment.  
 Prior period segment amounts throughout the condensed consolidated financial statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been reclassified to conform to the current segment structure. The reclassification of historical business segment information had no impact on our basic financial statements.  
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 (our  2016 Annual Report ). This discussion contains forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and experience and our perception of historical trends, current market conditions, including customer acceptance of our new products, current economic data, expected future developments, foreign currency exchange rates, and other factors that we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested in the forward-looking statements. Unless otherwise indicated,  Harman,   Company,   we,   our,  and  us  are used interchangeably to refer to Harman International Industries, Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. All amounts are in thousands unless otherwise indicated.  
 Executive Overview  
 We believe we are a leader in the design and engineering of connected products and solutions for automakers, consumers and enterprises worldwide, including connected car systems, audio and visual products, enterprise automation solutions and connected services. We have developed, both internally and through a series of strategic acquisitions, a broad range of product offerings sold under renowned brand names in our principal markets. Our AKG     , AMX     , Crown     , Harman/Kardon     , Infinity     , JBL     , JBL Professional, JBL Synthesis     , Lexicon     , Mark Levinson     , Martin     , Revel     , Soundcraft      and Studer      brand names are well known worldwide for premium quality and performance. Our software solutions power mobile devices and systems that are designed to be connected, integrated, personalized and adaptive across all platforms, from work and home, to car and mobile.  
 We report our business on the basis of four segments. Our Connected Car, Lifestyle Audio, Professional Solutions and Connected Services segments are based on our strategic approach to the markets and customers we serve. Other primarily includes compensation, benefit and occupancy costs for corporate employees, net of reporting segment allocations, expenses associated with new technology innovation and our corporate brand identity campaign.   
 We believe that innovation is an important element to gaining market acceptance of our products and strengthening our market position. We have a history of leveraging our continuous technological innovation across all of the markets we serve. We have a well-deserved reputation for delivering premium audio and connected car solutions across a full spectrum of applications. We believe that our technological innovation, the quality of our products and our reputation for on-time delivery have resulted in Harman being awarded a substantial amount of Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio automotive business. As of June 30, 2016, we have a cumulative estimated $24.1 billion of awarded Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio automotive business, which represents the estimated future lifetime net sales for all our automotive customers. This amount does not represent firm customer orders. We report our awarded business primarily based on award letters from our customers. To validate these awards, we use various assumptions, including global vehicle production forecasts, customer take rates for our products, revisions to product life-cycle estimates and the impact of annual price reductions and exchange rates, among other factors. The term  take rate  represents the number of units sold by us divided by an estimate of the total number of vehicles of a specific vehicle line produced during the same timeframe. The assumptions we use to validate these awards are updated and reported externally on an annual basis. We believe our awarded automotive business will position us well for follow-on and new business with these existing customers.  
 Our management uses the amount of our awarded business for short- and long-term budgeting and forecasting, development of earnings guidance and for planning future corporate investment and other activities, such as capital expenditures and restructuring. Our awarded business is also an input used to approximate our enterprise value. We believe our investors utilize this information for a number of reasons, including evaluating our future financial performance over time, to model our financial results of operations, to understand the risks inherent in our current operating plan, and as an input to approximate our enterprise value. However, our estimates of awarded automotive business are forward-looking statements and may not actually be achieved. See the risk factor  We may not realize sales represented by awarded business  in Item 1A  Risk Factors  of Part I of our 2016 Annual Report.  
 34 

Our products are sold worldwide, with the largest markets located in the United States and Germany. In the United States, ou  r primary manufacturing facilities are located in Kentucky, Indiana and Washington. Outside of the United States, we have manufacturing facilities in Austria, Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Germany, Mexico and the Netherlands.   
 Our sales and earnings may vary due to the production schedules and model year changeovers of our automotive customers, the holiday buying season for consumer audio products, customer acceptance of our products, the timing of new product introductions, product offerings by our competitors, fluctuations in the timing of contractual agreements for customer reimbursements for research, development and engineering expenses ( RD E ) and general economic conditions. Since most of our businesses operate using local currencies, our reported sales and earnings may also fluctuate due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, especially with respect to the value of the Euro and the U.S. Dollar.  
 We believe opportunities exist to grow our business in all of our business segments in emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China ( BRIC ). During the three months ended September 30, 2016, BRIC sales increased $90.8 million to $312.9 million, an increase of 40.9 percent over the same period in the prior fiscal year.  
 We continue to roll out our global marketing campaign featuring some of the world s most prominent organizations, artists, celebrities and athletes such as the National Basketball Association, Stephen Curry, Quincy Jones, DNCE, and Linkin Park, in order to increase brand awareness and support growth and market share gains across our entire business.  
 Critical Accounting Policies  
 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our 2016 Annual Report, except for recently adopted accounting standards disclosed in Note 2    New Accounting Standards  in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended September 30, 2016.

 Results of Operations  
 Net Sales  
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $1.760 billion compared to $1.631 billion in the same period in the prior year, an increase of 7.9 percent on both a nominal and constant currency basis. Net sales increased due to growth in our Lifestyle Audio, Connected Car, and Connected Services segments primarily due to the impact of strong demand for connected smart audio products in consumer audio and growth in our automotive businesses offset by a decrease in net sales in our Professional Solutions segment and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $0.7 million.  
 A summary of our net sales by business segment is presented below:

Connected Car     Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $41.6 million, or 5.5   percent, compared to the same period in the prior year, or 5.3 percent excluding foreign currency translation. The increase in net sales was driven by higher take rates, stronger automotive production and favorable foreign currency translation of $1.4 mil  lion.   
 Lifestyle Audio    Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $92.3 million, or 19.4 percent, compared to the same period in the prior year, or 19.0 percent excluding foreign currency translation. The increase in net sales was driven by strong demand for connected, smart audio products, higher take rates and stronger automotive production in car audio, and favorable foreign currency translation of $1.6 million.   
 Professional Solutions    Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $6.9 million, or 2.8 percent, compared to the same period in the prior year, or 2.3 percent excluding foreign currency translation due to weak demand and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $1.1 million.   
 Connected Services    Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $6.8 million, or 4.2 percent, compared to the same period in the prior year, or 6.0 percent excluding foreign currency translation. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by higher demand for automotive services, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $2.7 million.   
 Gross Profit  
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 0.9 percentage points to 30.8 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 29.9 percent in the same period in the prior year. The increase in overall gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by our Lifestyle Audio and Connected Car segments partially offset by decreases in overall gross profit as a percentage of net sales in our Professional Solutions and Connected Services segments.

 Connected Car    Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 1.3 percentage points to 24.8 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume leveraging a more efficient fixed production cost base.   
 Lifestyle Audio    Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 2.9 percentage points to 35.3 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to margin expansion in car audio as a result of operating leverage and manufacturing excellence.    
 Professional Solutions    Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.2 percentage points to 39.2 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to product mix.  
 Connected Services    Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.8 percentage points to 31.1 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher revenue on high margin engineering change orders in the prior year.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   
 Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) were $390.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $355.9 million in the same period in the prior year, an increase of $34.5 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG A increased 0.4 percentage points in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in SG A was primarily in support of increased net sales, higher restructuring expenses and an increase in a contingent consideration liability related to an acquisition, partially offset by tighter expense controls and favorable foreign currency translation of $0.1 million. RD E increased $1.4 million to $109.4 million, or 6.2 percent of net sales, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $107.9 million, or 6.6 percent of net sales, in the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher gross spending to support awarded business and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $0.3 million.

 Connected Car    SG A increased $12.3 million to $102.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in SG A was primarily in support of increased net sales, higher restructuring expenses, and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $0.3 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG A increased 0.9 percentage points to 12.9 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. RD E decreased $0.9 million to $48.3 million, or     6.1 percent of net sales, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $49.3 million, or 6.5 percent of net sales, in the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher customer reimbursements partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $0.2 million.   
 Lifestyle Audio    SG A increased $15.1 million to $122.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in SG A was primarily in support of increased net sales, including higher selling and marketing expenses related to our brand identity campaign, higher RD E and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $0.4 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG A decreased 1.0 percentage point to 21.5 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. RD E increased $6.2 million to $34.9 million, or 6.1 percent of net sales, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $28.7 million, or 6.0 percent of net sales in the same period in the prior year due to higher gross spending to support awarded business and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $0.1 million.  
 Professional Solutions    SG A increased $5.7 million to $82.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in SG A was primarily due to higher restructuring expenses, partially offset by tighter cost controls and favorable foreign currency translation of $0.3 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG A increased 3.3 percentage points to 34.3 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. RD E decreased $0.2 million to $17.6 million, or 7.3 percent of net sales, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $17.8 million, or 7.2 percent of net sales, in the same period in the prior year.  
 Connected Services    SG A increased $1.7 million to $50.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in a contingent consideration liability related to an acquisition partially offset by lower amortization of our intangible assets, lower RD E and favorable foreign currency translation of $0.4 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG A decreased     0.3 percentage points to 30.1 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. RD E decreased $2.1 million to $7.4 million, or 4.4 percent of net sales, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $9.4 million, or 5.9 percent of net sales, in the same period in the prior year.  
 37 

Other     Other SG A includes compensation, benefit and occupancy costs for corporate employees, new tec  hnology innovation and expenses associated with our corporate brand identity campaign. Other SG A increased $1.2 million to $35.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased   stock compensation costs.    
 Restructuring  
 Our restructuring program that is designed to improve our global footprint, cost structure, technology portfolio, human resources and internal processes continues. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we continued to refine existing programs and launched significant new programs focused on achieving further productivity improvements to: (i) optimize certain research and development, supply chain and administrative functions; (ii) outsource certain manufacturing capabilities; (iii) divest or sublease facilities no longer needed to support current operations; and (iv) relocate certain functions to best cost countries.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the total restructuring liability increased $7.3 million to $31.4 million, compared to the same period in the prior year period, primarily due to $12.6 million of expenses incurred for new programs or to refine existing programs offset by payments of $5.4 million. Refer to Note 16    Restructuring Program  in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our restructuring balance. 
 Goodwill  
 Goodwill was $1.511 billion at September 30, 2016 compared with $1.510 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase in goodwill in the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus June 30, 2016 was primarily associated with favorable foreign currency translation of $1.2 million partially offset by a decrease of $0.1 million in connection with the acquisition of TowerSec Ltd. ( TowerSec ).  
 Refer to Note 8 -  Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net  in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our goodwill balance. 
 We did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
 Operating Income  
 Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $150.8 million, or 8.6 percent of net sales, compared to operating income of $131.5 million, or 8.1 percent of net sales, in the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher leverage of fixed costs based on higher net sales volumes partially offset by higher SG A in support of increased net sales, a contingent consideration liability related to an acquisition and higher restructuring expenses. 
 Interest Expense, Net  
 Interest expense is reported net of interest income in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest expense, net was $9.3 million and $8.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross interest expense was $10.2 million and $8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The non-cash portion of gross interest expense was $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash portion of gross interest expense was $9.5 million and $8.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest income was $0.9 million and $0.5 million for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Non-cash interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 relates to the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs on the Euro denominated 2.000 Percent Senior Notes due 2022 (the  2.000 Percent Senior Notes ) issued on May 27, 2015 and the U.S. Dollar denominated 4.150 Percent Senior Notes due 2025 (the  4.150 Percent Senior Notes ) issued on May 11, 2015 and the amortization of debt issuance costs on the  Multi-Currency Credit Agreement entered into on March 26, 2015 by and among Harman, Harman Holding GmbH   Co. KG ( Harman KG ) and a group of banks (the  2015 Credit Agreement ).   
 Cash interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily relates to interest on the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes, the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes, and the 2015 Credit Agreement.  
 Cash interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily relates to interest on the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes, the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes, the 2015 Credit Agreement and our short-term borrowings.  
 Interest income primarily relates to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the variances from year to year are due to fluctuations in those balances and changes in interest rates.  
 38 

Foreign Exchange Gains, Net   
 Foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in Foreign exchange gains, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  
 Miscellaneous, Net  
 Miscellaneous, net expenses were $2.9 million and $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, Miscellaneous, net expenses primarily consisted of bank charges.  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, Miscellaneous, net expenses primarily consisted of bank charges, interest expense related to a disputed claim and accretion of certain acquisition consideration liabilities which are payable in the future.   
 Income Tax Expense, Net  
 Our provision for income taxes is based on an estimated annual tax rate for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $37.4 million and $33.5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 26.8 percent and 27.7 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to income mix and rate differentials between the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. 
 We have net deferred tax assets of $108.8 million primarily consisting of deferred deductions, interest and loss carryovers and research and experimentation credits. We have evaluated all available evidence, both positive and negative, and based upon such evidence we continue to believe that our net deferred tax assets are fairly reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the results of our operations do not meet our current expectations, our net deferred tax assets may become impaired.  
 As of September 30, 2016 unrecognized tax benefits and the related interest were $65.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively, all of which would affect the tax rate if recognized. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, $0.4 million of tax reserves were established on new uncertain tax positions. Related interest on prior year exposures was increased by $0.1 million. 
 Financial Condition  
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 We primarily finance our working capital requirements through cash generated by operations, the 2015 Credit Agreement, and trade credit. Cash and cash equivalents were $511.7 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $602.3 million at June 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $90.6 million. The decrease in cash was due to repayments of long-term debt, payments related to capital expenditures, dividends, repurchases of common stock under our board authorized share buyback programs and related to our share-based compensation arrangements, payment of contingent consideration, and the purchase of a convertible debt security, partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities. We also used cash to make investments in our manufacturing facilities, fund product development and meet the working capital needs of our business segments.  
 At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, there was approximately $483.0 million and $523.0 million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings, which are included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 there were $4.1 million of outstanding letters of credit under the 2015 Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, unused available credit under the 2015 Credit Agreement was $712.9 million and $672.9 million, respectively. In connection with the 2015 Credit Agreement, we incurred $3.0 million of fees and other expenses, which are included within Other assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. These costs are amortized over the term of the 2015 Credit Agreement to Interest expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis.  
   
 The 2015 Credit Agreement and each of the indentures underlying the 2.00 Percent Senior Notes and the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes contain provisions that limit our operating and financing activities. A violation of any of these covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding and/or the holders of the notes to direct the trustee to accelerate repayment of amounts outstanding under the notes. A default or acceleration under our debt agreements would result in increased capital costs and could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations and financial condition. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the 2015 Credit Agreement and each of the indentures underlying the 2.000 Percent Senior Notes and the 4.150 Percent Senior Notes.  
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents of $511.7 million at September 30, 2016, together with our expected future operating cash flows, and our availability of $712.9 million under the 2015 Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to cover our working  
 39 

capital needs, debt service, income tax payments, c  apital expenditures, including major investments related to manufacturing and research facilities in emerging markets, acquisitions, purchase commitments, restructuring projects, share buybacks and quarterly dividends for at least the next 12 months.   
 Our ability to maintain positive liquidity going forward depends on our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and maintain access to the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors beyond our control. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., the majority of which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2016, Cash and cash equivalents of $151.1 million were held in the U.S. and Cash and cash equivalents of $360.6 million were held by us in foreign jurisdictions. As of June 30, 2016, Cash and cash equivalents of $164.7 million were held in the U.S. and Cash and cash equivalents of $437.6 million were held by us in foreign jurisdictions. Below is a more detailed discussion of our cash flow activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.  
 Operating Activities  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net cash provided by operations was $69.6 million compared to $112.2 million used in operations in the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating cash flows compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to increases in accounts payable, smaller increases in inventory balances, and higher accrued liabilities partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. At September 30, 2016, working capital, excluding cash and short-term debt, was $650.5 million, compared with $571.0 million at June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher inventory, receivables and other current assets, partially offset by higher accounts payable, accrued liabilities and income taxes payable.  
 Investing Activities  
 Net cash used in investing activities was $49.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $34.7 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in net cash used in investing activities compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the purchase of a convertible debt security. Capital expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $33.5 million, in support of new Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio automotive awards, compared to $37.8 million for the same period in the prior year.   
 Financing Activities  
 Net cash used in financing activities was $113.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $97.6 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in payments of our contingent consideration and repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by the excess tax benefits for share-based compensation. Refer to Note 9-  Debt  in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our financing activities and material debt obligations including our 2.000 Percent Senior Notes, 4.150 Percent Senior Notes, and the 2015 Credit Agreement. 
 Equity  
 Total shareholders  equity at September 30, 2016 was $2.509 billion compared with $2.452 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase is primarily due to higher net income and the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, offset by treasury stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders.  
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 We utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in our operations when we enter into operating leases for land, buildings and equipment in the normal course of business, which are not included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we had outstanding letters of credit of $4.1 million at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 which were not included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
 Share Buyback Program  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 451,432 shares and 370,700, respectively, at a cost of $35.2 million and $37.1 million, respectively, for a total cumulative buyback of 2,083,180 shares at a cost of $175.2 million under the 2014 Buyback Program. Refer to Note 11-  Shareholders  Equity  in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our share buyback program. 
 40 

Business Outlook   
 Our future outlook is largely dependent upon global macroeconomic conditions. We believe that current consumer discretionary spending levels, automotive production rates and projected increased take rates, will continue to support growth rates above automotive industry production levels. Results in our Professional Solutions segment remain negatively impacted by sales channel rationalizations to support our new solutions based go-to-market structure. To mitigate these impacts we continue to launch new innovative products and are focusing our attention on completing the re-alignment of our sales structure to better capitalize on our unique end-to-end solutions. Our Connected Services segment s acquisition provides diversification of our customer base and moderation of our business cycle. We remain committed to our investment plans in the areas of RD E and marketing programs, driving growth through increased consumer awareness for our innovative new product introductions. We also remain committed to pursuing incremental productivity and restructuring programs, which are expected to provide an accelerated rate of earnings growth in future years. We continue to expect that capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales for fiscal year 2017 will remain in line with fiscal year 2016 levels.  
 Subsequent Events  
  Dividend Declaration   
 On November 3, 2016 we declared a cash dividend of $0.35 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The quarterly dividend will be paid on November 30, 2016 to each stockholder of record as of the close of business on November 14, 2016.  

Item 3.   
 
       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     

 We are required to include information about potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since June 30, 2016, there have been no material changes in the quantitative or qualitative aspects of our market risk profile. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk included in our 2016 Annual Report.  
 Interest Rate Sensitivity/Risk  
 At September 30, 2016, interest on approximately 36 percent of our borrowings was determined on a variable rate basis. The interest rates on the balances of our debt, cash and cash equivalents are subject to changes in U.S. and European short-term interest rates. To assess exposure to interest rate changes, we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates across all outstanding variable rate debt and investments. Our analysis indicates that the effect on net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of such an increase or decrease in interest rates would be approximately $0.7 million.  
 Foreign Currency Risk  
 We maintain significant operations in Germany, China, Hungary, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, India, and Brazil. As a result, we are subject to market risks arising from changes in these foreign currency exchange rates, principally the change in the value of the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar. Refer to Note 13    Derivatives  in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on our financial risk management. Changes in currency exchange rates, principally the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. Dollar have an impact on our reported results when the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars. Approximately 38 percent of our sales are denominated in Euros. The average exchange rate for the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 0.3 percent from the same period in the prior fiscal year.  
 We presently estimate the effect on fiscal year 2017 income before income taxes, based upon a recent estimate of foreign exchange translation exposure (translating the operating performance of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars), of a uniform strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar by 10 percent, would be to increase or decrease income before income taxes by approximately $5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Competitive conditions in the markets in which we operate may limit our ability to increase prices in the event of adverse changes in currency exchange rates. For example, certain products made in Europe are sold in the U.S. Sales of these products are affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro. Any weakening of the U.S. Dollar could depress the demand for these European manufactured products in the U.S. and reduce sales. However, due to the multiple currencies involved in our business and the netting effect of various simultaneous transactions, our foreign currency positions are partially offsetting. In addition, our foreign currency hedging program is designed to limit our exposure.  
 41 

Actual g  ains and losses in the future may differ materially from the hypothetical gains and losses discussed above based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate movements and our actual exposure and hedging transacti  ons.   

Item 4.   
 
       Controls and Procedures     

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  1934 Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We note that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions.  
 Interpretive guidance issued by the SEC staff permits the exclusion of an evaluation of the effectiveness of a registrant s disclosure controls and procedures as they relate to the internal control over financial reporting for acquired businesses during the first year following such acquisition. As discussed in Note 2 -  Acquisitions  in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and in Note 22    Acquisitions  in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of TowerSec Ltd. (the  Acquired Business ). The Acquired Business had total assets representing one percent of consolidated assets, and total revenues representing less than one percent of consolidated revenues included in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Management s evaluation and conclusion as to the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q excludes any evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Acquired Business.  
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  
 As a result of the acquisition of the Acquired Business, we have begun to integrate certain business processes and systems of the Acquired Business.  
 There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) as promulgated by the SEC under the 1934 Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Share Repurchases  
 On October 28, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of our common stock over a three year period (the  2014 Buyback Program ). The 2014 Buyback Program allows us to purchase shares of our common stock in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions during the authorized three year period. The 2014 Buyback Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We will determine the timing and the amount of any repurchases based on an evaluation of market conditions, share price, other growth opportunities and other factors. We have and may repurchase shares on the open market or, from time to time, through repurchase plans with one or more external brokers that provide a structure for execution of share repurchases under the 2014 Buyback Program. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 451,432 shares and 370,700, respectively, at a cost of $35.2 million and $37.1 million, respectively, for a total cumulative buyback of 2,083,180 shares at a cost of $175.2 million under the 2014 Buyback Program.
