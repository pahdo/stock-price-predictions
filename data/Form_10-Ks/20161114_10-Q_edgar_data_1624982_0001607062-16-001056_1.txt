our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and
other factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from the
results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different

  Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements  

Note
1 - Organization and Operations   

Sweets
  Treats, Inc. ( CA Corp )    

Sweets
  Treats, Inc. ( Predecessor ) was incorporated on April 13, 2011 under the laws of the State of California.  The
Predecessor is a bakery shop specializing in freshly-made cakes, cupcakes, desserts and special events catering.   

Atlas
Technology International, Inc. (fka Sweets   Treats, Inc.) ( DE Corp )    

Atlas
Technology International, Inc. (fka Sweets   Treats, Inc.) (the  Company ) was incorporated on July 7, 2014 under
the laws of the State of Delaware for the sole purpose of acquiring all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Predecessor.
Upon formation, the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of its common stock to the President of the Company as founder s shares
valued at par value of $0.00001 and recorded as compensation of $100.  

On

Predecessor for all of the Predecessor s issued and outstanding capital stock. No value was given to the common stock issued
by the newly formed corporation. Therefore, the shares were recorded to reflect the $0.00001 par value and paid in capital
was recorded as a negative amount of ($50). The acquisition process utilizes the capital structure of the Company and the assets
and liabilities of Predecessor, which are recorded at historical cost.  

The
Company applied paragraph 505-10-S99-3 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (formerly Topic 4B of the Staff Accounting
Bulletins ( SAB ) ( SAB Topic 4B ) issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC ), by reclassifying the Predecessor s undistributed retained earnings of $942 at July 17, 2014 to additional
paid-in capital.  

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared as if the Company had its corporate capital structure as of
the date of the incorporation of the Predecessor.  

On
March 11, 2016, the Company entered into certain Spin-Off Agreement with Tiffany Aguayo, the majority shareholder, pursuant to
which the Shareholder agreed to cancel 14,000,000 pre-split shares of Company's Common stock in exchange for the consummation
and execution of the Spin Off agreement and sale of Sweets   Treats, Inc., a CA Corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company to Ms. Aguayo. The transaction has not been consummated as of the date hereof but Ms. Aguayo still agreed to the
cancellation of her shares.  

On
July 5, 2016, Tiffany Aguayo, the majority shareholder, owning approximately 76.9% of the total issued and outstanding shares
of SWTS, entered into two separate Stock Purchase Agreements for the sale of 13,000,000 and 3,000,000 shares of SWTS common stock
equivalent to her complete ownership of SWTS with Ying-Chien Lin and Lynx Consulting Group Ltd ( Lynx ), respectively.
Pursuant to the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreements, Mr. Lin and Lynx owned approximately 62.5% and 14.4% of the total

Note
2 - Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices   

The
Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness
of accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important
to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult, subjective,
or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The Company s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted
accounting principles.  

Basis
of Presentation    

The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States for interim financial statements. Accordingly, such interim financial statements do not include
all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete annual
financial statements. The information furnished reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading. The balance sheet as
of June 30, 2016 has been derived from the Company s annual financial statements that were audited by an independent
registered public accounting firm, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required for complete annual
financial statements. The financial statements included in this Quarterly Report should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the eleven months ended June
30, 2016 filed with the SEC on September 27, 2016. 

Principles
of Consolidation    

The
Company applies the guidance of Topic 810   Consolidation   of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
 to determine whether and how to consolidate another entity.  Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-10
 all majority-owned subsidiaries all entities in which a parent has a controlling financial
interest shall be consolidated except (1) when control does not rest with the parent, the majority owner; (2) if the parent
is a broker-dealer within the scope of Topic 940 and control is likely to be temporary; (3) consolidation by an investment company
within the scope of Topic 946 of a non-investment-company investee.  Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-8  the
usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting interest, and, therefore, as a general
rule ownership by one reporting entity, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares of another
entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation. The power to control may also exist with a lesser percentage of ownership,
for example, by contract, lease, agreement with other stockholders, or by court decree . The Company consolidates  all
less-than-majority-owned subsidiaries, if any, in which the parent s power to control exists.   

The
Company consolidates the following  entities :  

Name
    of consolidated subsidiary or entity  
      State
    or other jurisdiction of incorporation or organization  
      Date

The
consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company and the subsidiary as of reporting period dates and for
the reporting periods then ended.  

All
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes
revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all
of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the
services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably
assured.  

The
Company also follows Section 606-10-55 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification relating to revenue from contracts with customers
for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes gross revenue when the Company: (i) is the primary obligor, (ii) have general
inventory risk, (iii) has discretion in establishing the price for the specified products, (iv) changes the product or performs
part of the service, (iv) has discretion in supplier selection, (v) is involved in the determination of product specifications,
(vi) bears physical loss inventory risk, and (vii) has credit risk. The number of the above criteria met and to which extent shall
determine whether the Company considers the revenue to be reported as gross or net.  

The
Company has incurred approximately $236,000 revenue for the three months ended September 2016, and they were all from one customer.  

Note
3   Going Concern   

The
Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial
Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ) .  

The
Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  

As
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016,
a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company is attempting to generate sufficient revenue; however, its cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations.
While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise additional
funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
the Company s ability to further implement its business plan, generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional
funds.  

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.

Convertible
Short Term Debt   

  On
July 5, 2016, Tiffany Aguayo, owning approximately 85.8% of the total liabilities as of June 30, 2016, entered into a Debt Assignment
Agreement and sold $40,000 of the outstanding debt from advances made on behalf of the Company to Growth Point Advisors Ltd. Pursuant
to this Agreement, the Company entered into a Convertible Promissory Note (the  Note ) with Growth Point Advisors
Ltd. to replace the Debt Assignment Agreement. The Note bears an interest rate of 8% per annum, due on July 4    th   2017,
and has a conversion feature allowing conversion by giving five days  notice to the Company to convert the debt into the
Company s common shares at a rate of $0.002 per share.  As part of the modification, the Company analyzed the note
and determined that the change in term did qualify as a debt extinguishment under ASC 470-50. 
Therefore a Beneficial Conversion Feature value of this convertible promissory note has been calculated to be $40,000 and the
amortization of the debt discount for this period is $9,667.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

   The
information set forth in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A )
contains certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
including, among others (i) expected changes in our revenue and profitability, (ii) prospective business opportunities and (iii)
our strategy for financing our business. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements
of current condition. Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of terms such as  believes ,  anticipates ,
 intends  or  expects . These forward-looking statements relate to our plans, liquidity, ability to complete
financing and purchase capital expenditures, growth of our business including entering into future agreements with companies,
and plans to successfully develop and obtain approval to market our product. We have based these forward-looking statements largely
on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial
condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs.   

Although
we believe that our expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the
bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections,
the inclusion of forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other
person that our objectives or plans will be achieved.   

We
assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions
affecting forward-looking statements.   

Our
revenues and results of operations could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result
of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the risk of significant natural disaster, the inability of
our company to insure against certain risks, inflationary and deflationary conditions and cycles, currency exchange rates, and
changing government regulations domestically and internationally affecting our products and businesses.   

   You
should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes attached hereto, and
the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

   Overview   

 The Company is engaged in the touchscreen industry through its Hong Kong subsidiary, incorporated on August 18, 2016, specializing
in the design and trading of touchscreen products and services. We also operate a bakery based in California, specializing
in freshly-made cakes and cupcakes and also offering other baked goods, as well as hot and cold beverages. On July 18, 2014,
we completed a share exchange whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Sweets  
Treats CA. Sweets   Treats CA became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we have operated our business through Sweets  
Treats CA since the Share Exchange. 

We
currently market our touchscreen products primarily through personal referrals, and the baking products primarily through our
website, social media and personal referrals. Our plan for the next twelve months calls for reviewing the company s bakery
business and development of the touchscreen business. We anticipate that the cost for developing our touchscreen business will
be approximately $250,000. Despite our plan, we currently have no commitments for any financing and cannot provide assurance that
we will realize this goal.  

Recent
Development   

On
July 5, 2016, Tiffany Aguayo, the majority shareholder, owning approximately 76.9% of the total issued and outstanding shares
of SWTS, entered into two separate Stock Purchase Agreements for the sale of 13,000,000 and 3,000,000 shares of SWTS common stock
equivalent to her complete ownership of SWTS with Ying-Chien Lin and Lynx Consulting Group Ltd ( Lynx ), respectively.
Pursuant to the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreements, Mr. Lin and Lynx owned approximately 62.5% and 14.4% of the total
voting rights of SWTS, respectively.  

On
July 7, 2016, Mr. Lin was elected as Chairman and director, and Mr. Ming-Shu Tsai was elected as director and Co-CEO with Tiffany
Aguayo.  

On
August 10, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a change in its Fiscal Year from July 31 to June 30 to be more efficient
for administrative purposes. The change in fiscal year became effective for the Company's 2016 fiscal year which began July
1, 2015 and ended June 30, 2016.  

On
August 23, 2016, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
in which the Company confirmed its name change to Atlas Technology International, Inc. and set forth therein the designations
for the Series A, B and C Preferred Stock (the bylaws of the Company were not amended to reflect the Certificate of Designations
for the Series A, B and C Preferred Stock).  

On
September 30, 2016, Tiffany Aguayo resigned from all of her positions with the Atlas Technology International, Inc. (the  Company 
namely: Co-Chief Executive Officer; Chief Financial Officer; President and Director. Ms. Aguayo s resignation is based solely
on personal reasons and is not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operation, policies
(including accounting or financial policies) or practices. The board of directors is now comprised of the two remaining members. Concurrent
with Ms. Aguayo s resignation, the board of directors appointed Jing Zhou and Yi An Chen as Chief Finance Officer and Chief
Technology Officer, respectively.  

Plan
of Operations   

  Our
goal is to maintain the quality of our products and to build a sufficient customer base for the design and selling of touchscreen
products. We anticipate the cost for developing our touchscreen business will be approximately $500,000 within the next 12 months.
We have not commitments for any financing and cannot provide assurance that we will realize this goal.  

If
we are unable to build a sustainable customer base, we will cease our development and/or marketing operations until we raise money.
Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult. As such, if we cannot secure
additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment. We intend to raise additional
capital through private placements, but there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve any capital-raising. If we need
additional cash but are unable to raise it, we will either suspend marketing operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations
entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans.  

Results
of Operations - Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended October 31, 2015  

  We
generated revenue of $235,971 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. The increase
in revenue is mainly attributed to the Company s entry into the touchscreen industry business. The Company has received
orders from one (1) customer for the production of touchscreens per their requirements. The Company designed, located manufacturer
and supplier of raw materials, quality checked the products and arranged the delivery of the touchscreen products to the customers.
Cost of sales were related mainly to the raw material cost and the manufacturing fees of the touchscreens. We incurred operating
expenses of $169,630 and $2,065 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. The increase
is mainly due to the engagement of consultants for services to be provided, engagement of employees, and professional services
provided. We incurred R D expenses of $27,729 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.
The increase is due to the Company s entry into the touchscreen industry to develop touchscreens that meet client requirements.
We incurred interest expense of $10,407 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.
The increase is due to the assignment of non-interest bearing debt from a related party and pursuant to that assignment the Company
entered into a convertible promissory note bearing interest with the new debt holder which has beneficial conversion feature.
We had a net loss of $103,290 and $2,065 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.  

  Liquidity
and Capital Resources  

  As
of September 30, 2016, we had total assets of $267,341, mainly in accounts receivable. Our liabilities as of September 30, 2016
were $318,252, which comprised of $183,210 in accounts payable, $30,940 in accrued expenses and $73,769 in loans. As of September
30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $20,578.  

  The
following is a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the  three
months ended September 30, 2016:  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had used $46,036 for operating activities and financing activities provided $49,302.
We had a net increase of $3,266 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

  We
are dependent on the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our business
plan. If we are unable to raise additional cash, we will either have to suspend or cease our expansion plans entirely. If we are
not successful in generating sufficient revenue and cannot raise sufficient funds, we may be forced to cease operations. If that
is the case, we will look for possible merger candidate or another suitable company to possibly acquire us.  

   Going
Concern   

  Our
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity
of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  

As
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016, a net loss
and net cash received in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt from
our auditor about our ability to continue as a going concern.  

  We
are attempting to generate sufficient revenue; however, its cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations.
While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds,
there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability
to further implement its business plan, generate sufficient revenue and in our ability to raise additional funds.  

   Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

    Basis
of Presentation    

  Our
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( U.S. GAAP ) for the interim financial information, and with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all
of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim financial statements
furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary
to a fair statement of the results for the interim period presented. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative
of the results for the full fiscal year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
of our company for the reporting period ended June 30, 2016 and notes thereto contained in our Registration Statement on Form
S-1, of which was declared effective on June 5, 2015.  

    Use
of Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions    

  The
preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period(s).  

Critical
accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and
judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact
of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. Our critical accounting estimates and assumptions
affecting the financial statements were:  

(iv)      Assumption
                                         as a going concern : Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going
                                         concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation
                                         of liabilities in the normal course of business.    

(v)      Allowance
                                         for doubtful accounts : Management s estimate of the allowance for doubtful
                                         accounts is based on historical sales, historical loss levels, and an analysis of the
                                         collectability of individual accounts; and general economic conditions that may affect
                                         a client s ability to pay. The Company evaluated the key factors and assumptions
                                         used to develop the allowance in determining that it is reasonable in relation to the
                                         financial statements taken as a whole.    

(vi)      Valuation
                                         allowance for deferred tax assets : Management assumes that the realization of the
                                         Company s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss ( NOL )
                                         carry forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future
                                         taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential
                                         tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance.
                                         Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses,
                                         (b) general economic conditions, and (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support
                                         its daily operations by way of a public or private offering, among other factors.    

  These
significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached
to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.  

  Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the
financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  

  Management
regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes
in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those
estimates are adjusted accordingly.  

  Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  

    Cash
Equivalents    

  We
consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.  

Revenue
Recognition    

We
recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. We consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all
of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the
services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably
assured.  

    Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

We
follow paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial
instruments and paragraph 82010-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph ###-##-#### establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency
and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy
gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described
below:  

Level
    1   
      Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   

Level
    2   
      Pricing
    inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable
    as of the reporting date.   

Level
    3   
      Pricing
    inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.   

  The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.  

  The
carrying amounts of our financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, prepaid professional fees, accounts
payable, accrued expenses, and customer deposits approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.  

  Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the
related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
representations can be substantiated.  

   Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

  We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures, or capital
resources that are material to an investment in our securities.  

   Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

  Not
applicable because we are a smaller reporting company.  

   Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

   Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

  Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation,
with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO )
and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) (the Company s principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness
of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of September 30. 2016 to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure for the reason described below.  

  Because
of our limited operations, we have limited number of employees which prohibits a segregation of duties. In addition, we lack a
formal audit committee with a financial expert. As we grow and expand our operations, we will engage additional employees and
experts as needed. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will expand.  

   Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

  There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business.
However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time
to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.
