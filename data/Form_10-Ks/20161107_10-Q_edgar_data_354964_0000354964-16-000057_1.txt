NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

1. 
    Organization and Basis of Presentation 

HSBC Finance Corporation is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ( HSBC North America ), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc ( HSBC  and, together with its subsidiaries, "HSBC Group"). The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of HSBC Finance Corporation and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods have been made. HSBC Finance Corporation and its subsidiaries may also be referred to in this Form 10-Q as  we,   us  or  our.  These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the "2015 Form 10-K"). Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our income tax benefit was impacted by a reversal of approximately   $15 million   associated with an out of period adjustment to our deferred tax asset balance. 
  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern. Such assertion contemplates our receivable sales program, the significant losses recognized and the challenges we anticipate to our operating results under prevailing and forecasted economic and business conditions. HSBC continues to be fully committed and has the capacity to continue to provide the necessary capital and liquidity to fund continuing operations. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Unless otherwise noted, information included in these notes to the consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations for all periods presented. See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations," in our 2015 Form 10-K for further details. Interim results should not be considered indicative of results in future periods.

    Receivables Held for Investment, net 

Receivables held for investment, net consisted of the following: 

(1)   
    At December 31, 2015, amount includes   $1,654 million   of closed-end real estate secured receivables which serve as collateral for secured financings previously issued under public trusts with an outstanding balance of   $879 million   at December 31, 2015. See Note 11, "Variable Interest Entities," for additional information. 
               (2)   
    At December 31, 2015, amount includes deferred origination fees, net of costs, totaling   $71 million   and net unamortized premium on our receivables totaling   $35 million  . 
     In September 2016, we expanded our receivable sales program to include all remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment and transferred the remainder of these receivables to held for sale. See Note 4, "Receivables Held for Sale," for additional information. 
  Aging Analysis of Past Due Receivables   As a result of the transfer of the remainder of the receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale, there are no balances to report in the aging analysis of past due receivables at September 30, 2016. The following table summarizes the past due status of our receivables held for investment at December 31, 2015. The aging of past due amounts is determined based on the contractual delinquency status of payments made under the terms of the receivable. An account is generally considered to be contractually delinquent when payments have not been made in accordance with the loan terms. Delinquency status is affected by customer account management policies and practices, such as re-aging. 

(1)   
    Receivables less than   30   days past due are presented as current. 
               (2)   
    The receivable balances included in this table reflect the principal amount outstanding on the loan net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies and include certain basis adjustments to the loan such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and premiums or discounts on purchased loans. However, these basis adjustments on the loans are excluded in other presentations of dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency, nonaccrual receivable and nonperforming receivable account balances. 
     Nonaccrual receivables    Nonaccrual receivables and nonaccrual receivables held for sale are all receivables which are   90   or more days contractually delinquent as well as second lien receivables (regardless of delinquency status) where the first lien receivable that we own or service is   90   or more days contractually delinquent. Nonaccrual receivables do not include receivables which have made qualifying payments and have been re-aged such that the contractual delinquency status has been reset to current. If a re-aged receivable subsequently experiences payment default and becomes   90   or more days contractually delinquent, it will be reported as nonaccrual. 
  Nonaccrual receivables and nonaccrual receivables held for sale consisted of the following:

    The receivable balances included in this table reflect the principal amount outstanding on the loan net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies but exclude any basis adjustments to the loan such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Additionally, the balances in this table related to receivables which have been classified as held for sale have been reduced by the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded as well as the credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to the transfer. 
               (2)   
    At   December 31, 2015  , nonaccrual real estate secured receivables held for investment includes   $187 million   of receivables that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. 
      The following table provides additional information on our total nonaccrual receivables: 
                             Nine Months Ended September 30,

Troubled Debt Restructurings    We report as troubled debt restructurings ("TDR Loans") substantially all receivables modified as a result of a financial difficulty, regardless of whether the modification was permanent or temporary, including all modifications with trial periods. Additionally, we report as TDR Loans all re-ages, except first time early stage delinquency re-ages where the customer has not been granted a prior re-age or modification. TDR Loans also include receivables discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed. TDR Loans are considered to be impaired loans. The TDR Loan balances in the tables below reflect the principal amount outstanding on the receivable net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies and include all basis adjustments on the receivable, such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans and premiums or discounts on purchased receivables. Additionally, the carrying amount of TDR Loans classified as held for sale has been reduced by both the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment as well as the credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to the transfer. TDR Loans are considered to be impaired loans regardless of their accrual status. 
  Modifications for real estate secured receivables may include changes to one or more terms of the loan, including, but not limited to, a change in interest rate, an extension of the amortization period, a reduction in payment amount, partial forgiveness or deferment of principal or other loan covenants. A substantial amount of our modifications involve interest rate reductions which lower the amount of interest income we are contractually entitled to receive for a period of time in future periods. By lowering the interest rate and making other changes to the loan terms, we believe we are able to increase the amount of cash flow that will ultimately be collected from the loan, given the borrower's financial condition. Re-aging is an account management action that results in the resetting of the contractual delinquency status of an account to current which generally requires the receipt of two qualifying payments. TDR Loans which are classified as held for investment are reserved for based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans' original effective interest rate which generally results in a higher reserve requirement for these loans. The portion of the credit loss reserves on TDR Loans held for investment that is associated with the discounting of cash flows is released from credit loss reserves over the life of the TDR Loan. There are no credit loss reserves associated with TDR Loans classified as held for sale as they are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.

The following table presents information about receivables held for investment and receivables held for sale which as a result of any account management action taken during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 became classified as TDR Loans as well as a summary of the type of account management action taken. 

The table below presents information about our TDR Loans and TDR Loans held for sale, including the related allowance for credit losses. The TDR Loan carrying value trend in the table below reflects the impact of the transfer of the remainder of our receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale in September 2016 as well as receivable sales during the first nine months of 2016. 

(1)   
    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the unpaid principal balance reflected above includes   $711 million   and   $740 million  , respectively, which have received a reduction in the unpaid principal balance as part of an account management action. 
               (2)   
    At   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of TDR Loans held for investment includes   $250 million   that are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. 
               (3)   
    There are no credit loss reserves associated with receivables classified as held for sale as they are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.

    The provision for credit losses and charge-offs for real estate secured receivables during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   include   $557 million   and   $576 million  , respectively, related to the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment attributable to credit factors for receivables transferred to held for sale. For the three and   nine   months ended September 30, 2015, the provision for credit losses and charge-offs included   $12 million   and   $232 million  , respectively, related to the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment attributable to credit factors for receivables transferred to held for sale. See Note 4, "Receivables Held for Sale," for additional information. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net charge-offs dollars were impacted by an out of period adjustment which decreased net charge-offs by   $12 million   in order to properly reflect charge-offs for receivables which received a partial forgiveness of principal as a result of an account modification in prior periods. The provision for credit losses for real estate secured receivables during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was impacted by a release of approximately   $19 million   associated with a correction to our credit loss reserve calculation for a segment of our portfolio. 
               (2)   
    For collateral dependent receivables that are transferred to held for sale, existing credit loss reserves at the time of transfer are recognized as a charge-off. We transferred to held for sale certain real estate secured receivables during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 and, accordingly, we recognized the existing credit loss reserves on these receivables as additional charge-off totaling   $244 million   and   $268 million   during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $24 million   and   $1,617 million   during the three and   nine   months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
               (3)   
    These amounts represent TDR Loans for which we evaluate reserves using a discounted cash flow methodology. Each loan is individually identified as a TDR Loan and then grouped together with other TDR Loans with similar characteristics. The discounted cash flow impairment analysis is then applied to these groups of TDR Loans. The receivable balance above excludes TDR Loans held for investment that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell which totaled   $249 million   at September 30, 2015. The reserve component above excludes credit loss reserves totaling   $10 million   at September 30, 2015 for TDR Loans held for investment that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. These receivables and credit loss reserves are reflected within receivables and credit loss reserves carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in the table above.

    Receivables Held for Sale  

Real Estate Secured Receivables    Real estate secured receivables held for sale which are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value are comprised of the following: 

(1)   
    At September 30, 2016, receivables held for sale includes   $790 million   of closed-end real estate secured receivables which are part of a collateralized funding transaction. These receivables will be sold when they are contractually released as collateral under the public trust and become available for sale. See Note 11,  Variable Interest Entities,  for further discussion of our collateralized funding transactions. 
     As discussed in prior filings, since 2007 we have been engaged in an on-going evaluation of our operations as we seek to optimize our risk profile and cost structure as well as our liquidity, capital and funding requirements. As part of this on-going evaluation, in September 2016, we further expanded our receivable sales program to include all remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment as we no longer have the intent to hold these receivables. As a result of this decision, we transferred  
  
   16 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

receivables to held for sale with a carrying value of   $7,814 million  , including accrued interest, at the time of transfer and recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of approximately   $541 million  . All of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses. This decision further accelerates our run-off strategy and, as a result, during the third quarter of 2016, we recorded pre-tax expense of   $31 million   for severance and loan review costs. We will continue to incur loan review costs in future periods as we prepare these receivables for sale. 
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we transferred real estate secured receivables to held for sale (including the expansion of the receivable sales program in September 2016) with a total unpaid principal balance (excluding accrued interest) of approximately   $8,219 million   and   $8,577 million  , respectively, at the time of transfer. The carrying value of these receivables prior to transfer after considering the fair value of the property less cost to sell, as applicable, was approximately   $8,087 million   and   $8,429 million  , respectively, including accrued interest. As we plan to sell these receivables to third party investors, fair value represents the price we believe a third party investor would pay to acquire the receivable portfolios. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on all receivables transferred to held for sale totaling   $562 million   and   $587 million  , respectively. Of this amount,   $557 million   and   $576 million  , respectively, was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income (loss) and   $5 million   and   $11 million  , respectively, was attributable to non-credit factors and recorded as a component of other revenues in the consolidated statement of income (loss). 
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $15 million   and   $145 million  , respectively, of additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables held for sale as a component of total other revenues in the consolidated statement of income (loss) related to changes in fair value as a result of establishing separate pools for receivables being marketed. Removing these receivables from their risk-based grouping impacts the valuation of the receivables remaining in the risked-based pools. 
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we transferred real estate secured receivables to held for sale with an unpaid principal balance (excluding accrued interest) of approximately   $280 million   and   $11,711 million  , respectively, at the time of transfer. The carrying value of these receivables prior to transfer after considering the fair value of the property less cost to sell was approximately   $284 million   and   $12,099 million  , respectively, including accrued interest. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of   $12 million   and   $232 million  , respectively, associated with the newly transferred loans all of which was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income (loss). 
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded an additional lower of amortized cost or fair value of   $84 million   and   $137 million  , respectively, related to changes in fair value as a result of a change in the estimated pricing on specific pools of receivables. 
  We continue to make progress in our strategy to run-off and sell our real estate secured receivable portfolio. During the three and   nine   months ended September 30, 2016, we completed sales of receivables with an unpaid principal balance of   $930 million   (aggregate carrying value of   $714 million  ) and   $5,652 million   (aggregate carrying value of   $4,933 million  ), respectively, at the time of sale to third-party investors. Aggregate cash consideration received totaled   $715 million   and   $5,382 million   during the three and   nine   months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. As a result, we recorded a   loss   on sale of   $5 million  , including transactions costs, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and a   gain   on sale of   $418 million  , including transaction costs, during the year-to-date period.  
  In October 2016, we completed the sale of a pool of real estate secured receivables with an unpaid principal balance of   $892 million   (aggregate carrying value of   $757 million  ) at the time of sale to a third-party investor. Aggregate cash consideration received totaled   $761 million  . We currently expect that during the fourth quarter of 2016 we will record a   loss   on this transaction of approximately   $5 million  , which includes transaction costs. 
  Historically, receivables held for sale have been sold to investors or, if the foreclosure process is completed prior to sale, the underlying properties acquired in satisfaction of the receivables have been classified as real estate owned ("REO") and the property is subsequently sold. As we continue to work with borrowers, we have also historically agreed to short sales whereby the property is sold by the borrower at a price which has been pre-negotiated with us and the borrower is released from further obligation. Accordingly, based on the projected timing of receivable sales and the expected flow of foreclosure volume into REO or settled through a short sale, a portion of the real estate secured receivables classified as held for sale will ultimately become REO or settled through a short sale. As a result, a portion of the non-credit fair value adjustment recorded on these receivables may be reversed in earnings when they become REO or settle through a short sale. 
  Receivable Held for Sale Activity During the Period    The following table summarizes the activity in receivables held for sale during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015:

     Fair Value Option 

We report our results to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies (the "Group Reporting Basis"), which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and as endorsed by the European Union ("EU"). We have elected to apply fair value option ("FVO") reporting to certain of our fixed rate debt issuances which also qualify for FVO reporting under the Group Reporting Basis. The following table summarizes fixed rate debt issuances accounted for under FVO: 

(1)   
    Balance includes a foreign currency translation adjustment relating to our foreign denominated FVO debt which decreased the debt balance by   $215 million   at   September 30, 2016   and decreased the debt balance by   $283 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
     We determine the fair value of the fixed rate debt accounted for under FVO through the use of a third party pricing service. Such fair value represents the full market price (including credit and interest rate impacts) based on observable market data for the same or similar debt instruments. See Note 12, "Fair Value Measurements,  for a description of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our fixed rate debt accounted for under FVO. 
  The following table summarizes the components of the gain (loss) on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015: 

(1)   
    The derivatives associated with debt designated at fair value are economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting. See Note 6, "Derivative Financial Instruments," for additional discussion of these non-qualifying hedges. 
               (2)   
    Mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives excludes market value changes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency translation gains (losses) recorded in derivative related income (expense) associated with debt designated at fair value was a   loss   of   $22 million   and a   loss   of   $1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and a   loss   of   $68 million   and a   gain   of   $206 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. Offsetting gains (losses) recorded in derivative related income (expense) associated with the related derivatives was a   gain   of   $22 million   and a   gain   of   $1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and a   gain   of   $68 million   and a   loss   of   $206 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
     The movement in the fair value reflected in gain (loss) on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives includes the effect of our own credit spread changes and interest rate changes, including any economic ineffectiveness in the relationship between the related derivatives and our debt and any realized gains or losses on those derivatives. With respect to the credit component, as our credit spreads narrow accounting losses are booked and the reverse is true if credit spreads widen. Differences arise between the movement in the fair value of our debt and the fair value of the related derivative due to the different credit characteristics and  
  
   20 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

differences in the calculation of fair value for debt and derivatives. The size and direction of the accounting consequences of such changes can be volatile from period to period but do not alter the cash flows intended as part of our interest rate management strategy. On a cumulative basis, we have recorded fair value option adjustments which increased the value of our debt by   $121 million   and   $155 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The change in the fair value of the debt and the change in value of the related derivatives during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 reflects the following: 
             
    Interest rate curve     During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, changes in market movements on certain debt and related derivatives that mature in the near term resulted in a gain in the interest rate component on the mark-to-market of the debt and a loss on the mark-to-market of the related derivative. As these items near maturity, their values are less sensitive to interest rate movements. Changes in the value of the interest rate component of the debt as compared with the related derivative are also affected by differences in cash flows and valuation methodologies for the debt and the derivatives. Cash flows on debt are discounted using a single discount rate from the bond yield curve for each bond s applicable maturity while derivative cash flows are discounted using rates at multiple points along an interest rate yield curve. The impacts of these differences vary as short-term and long-term interest rates shift and time passes. Furthermore, certain FVO debt no longer has any corresponding derivatives. 
                
    Credit     Our secondary market credit spreads tightened during the three months ended September 30, 2016 which more than offset a widening of our credit spreads during the first half of 2016. Our secondary market credit spreads were essentially flat during the three months ended September 30, 2015 and widened during the prior year-to-date period.  

6. 
    Derivative Financial Instruments 

Our business activities involve analysis, evaluation, acceptance and management of some degree of risk or combination of risks. Accordingly, we have comprehensive risk management policies to address potential financial risks, which include credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, and operational risks. Our risk management policy is designed to identify and analyze these risks, to set appropriate limits and controls, and to monitor the risks and limits continually by means of reliable and up-to-date administrative and information systems. Our risk management policies are primarily carried out in accordance with practice and limits set by the HSBC Group Management Board. The HSBC North America Asset Liability Committee ( HSBC North America ALCO ) meets regularly to review risks and approve appropriate risk management strategies within the limits established by the HSBC Group Management Board. Additionally, our Risk Management Committee receives regular reports on our interest rate and liquidity risk positions in relation to the established limits. In accordance with the policies and strategies established by HSBC North America ALCO, in the normal course of business, we historically entered into various transactions involving derivative financial instruments. These derivative financial instruments primarily are used as economic hedges to manage risk. 
  Objectives for Holding Derivative Financial Instruments    Market risk (which includes interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks) is the possibility that a change in underlying market rate inputs will cause a financial instrument to decrease in value or become more costly to settle. Prior to our ceasing originations in our Consumer Lending business and ceasing loan purchase activities in our Mortgage Services business, customer demand for our loan products shifted between fixed rate and floating rate products, based on market conditions and preferences. These shifts in loan products resulted in different funding strategies and produced different interest rate risk exposures. Additionally, the mix of receivables on our balance sheet and the corresponding market risk is changing as we manage the liquidation of our receivable portfolio. We maintain an overall risk management strategy that utilizes derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in currency exchange rates related to our debt liabilities. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of cross currency interest rate swaps. Historically, we managed our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swaps with the main objective of managing the interest rate volatility due to a mismatch in the duration of our assets and liabilities. 
  We have entered into currency swaps to convert both principal and interest payments on debt issued in one currency to the appropriate functional currency. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements between two counterparties for the exchange of periodic interest payments generally based on a notional principal amount and agreed-upon fixed or floating rates. The majority of our interest rate swaps were used to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by converting floating rate debt to fixed rate or by converting fixed rate debt to floating rate.  
  To manage our exposure to changes in interest rates, we entered into currency swaps and historically interest rate swap agreements which have been designated as cash flow hedges under derivative accounting principles, or are treated as non-qualifying hedges. We currently utilize the long-haul method to assess effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges. 
  We do not manage credit risk or the changes in fair value due to the changes in credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments such as credit derivatives or credit default swaps. 
  
   21 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

Control Over Valuation Process and Procedures    A control framework has been established which is designed to ensure that fair values are validated by a function independent of the risk-taker. To that end, the ultimate responsibility for the measurement of fair values rests with the HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee. The HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee establishes policies and procedures to ensure appropriate valuations. Fair values for derivatives are measured by management using valuation techniques, valuation models and inputs that are developed, reviewed, validated and approved by the Markets Independent Model Review Team of an HSBC affiliate. These valuation models utilize discounted cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity. The models used apply appropriate control processes and procedures to ensure that the derived inputs are used to value only those instruments that share similar risk to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors. 
  Credit Risk of Derivatives    By utilizing derivative financial instruments, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract. We manage the counterparty credit (or repayment) risk in derivative instruments through established credit approvals, risk control limits, collateral, and ongoing monitoring procedures. We utilize an affiliate, HSBC Bank USA, National Association (together with its subsidiaries, "HSBC Bank USA") as the sole provider of derivatives. We have never suffered a loss due to counterparty credit failure. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had derivative contracts with a notional amount of   $1.8 billion   and   $8.9 billion  , respectively, all of which is outstanding with HSBC Bank USA making them our sole counterparty in derivative transactions. Derivative financial instruments are generally expressed in terms of notional principal or contract amounts which are much larger than the amounts potentially at risk for nonpayment by counterparties. Derivative agreements require that payments be made to, or received from, the counterparty when the fair value of the agreement reaches a certain level. When the fair value of our agreements with the affiliate counterparty requires the posting of collateral, it is provided in either the form of cash and recorded on the balance sheet, consistent with third party arrangements, or in the form of securities which are not recorded on our balance sheet. The fair value of our agreements with the affiliate counterparty required us to provide collateral to the affiliate of   $189 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $491 million   at   December 31, 2015  , all of which was provided in cash. These amounts are offset against the fair value amount recognized for derivative instruments that have been offset under the same master netting arrangement and recorded in our balance sheet as derivative financial assets or derivative related liabilities which are included as a component of other assets and other liabilities, respectively.

The following table presents the fair value of derivative contracts by major product type on a gross basis. Gross fair values exclude the effects of both counterparty netting and collateral, and therefore are not representative of our exposure. The table below also presents the amounts of counterparty netting and cash collateral that have been offset in the consolidated balance sheet. 

(1)   
    All of our derivatives are bilateral over-the-counter derivatives. 
               (2)   
    Represents the netting of derivative receivable and payable balances for the same counterparty under an enforceable netting agreement. Gross amounts offset in the balance sheet includes cash collateral paid of   $189 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $491 million   at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any financial instrument collateral received/posted. 
      Fair Value Hedges    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we do not have any active fair value hedges. We recorded fair value adjustments to the carrying value of our debt for terminated fair value hedges which decreased the debt balance by   $15 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $15 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Cash Flow Hedges    Cash flow hedges include currency swaps to convert debt issued from one currency into U.S. dollar fixed rate debt and have historically also included interest rate swaps to convert our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt by fixing future interest rate resets of floating rate debt. Gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and totaled losses of less than   $1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $15 million   at   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We expect less than   $1 million   of currently unrealized net losses will be reclassified to earnings within one year. However, these reclassified unrealized losses will be offset by decreased interest expense associated with the variable cash flows of the hedged items and will result in no significant impact to our earnings.

Non-Qualifying Hedging Activities    Previously     we entered into interest rate swaps which were not designated as hedges under derivative accounting principles. These financial instruments were economic hedges but did not qualify for hedge accounting and were primarily used to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates through more closely matching both the structure and duration of our liabilities to the structure and duration of our assets. As we continued to make progress in our strategy to accelerate the run-off and sale of our real estate secured receivable portfolio, the dynamics of the duration of our receivables due to lower prepayment rates and the corresponding increase in interest rate risk began changing. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we began reducing the size of this portfolio of interest rate swaps. During the second quarter of 2016, we terminated all of the remaining interest rate swaps in this portfolio of non-qualifying hedges which had a notional value of   $2,600 million   at the time of termination.  
  The following table provides detail of the realized and unrealized gain or loss recorded on our non-qualifying hedges: 

We have elected the fair value option for certain issuances of our fixed rate debt and have entered into currency swaps and historically interest rate swaps related to debt carried at fair value. The currency swaps and historically the interest rate swaps associated with this debt are non-qualifying hedges but are considered economic hedges and realized gains and losses are reported as  Gain (loss) on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives  within other revenues. The derivatives related to fair value option debt are included in the tables below.

    Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Defined Benefit Pension Plan    The components of pension expense for the defined benefit pension plan recorded in our consolidated statement of income (loss) and shown in the table below reflect the portion of pension expense of the combined HSBC North America Pension Plan (either the "HSBC North America Pension Plan" or the "Plan") which has been allocated to us. 

During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , pension expense was impacted by an out of period adjustment which increased pension expense by   $5 million   in order to properly reflect changes in participant census data which should have been included in pension valuations in prior periods. 
  Postretirement Plans Other Than Pensions    The components of our net postretirement benefit cost are as follows:

    Related Party Transactions 

In the normal course of business, we conduct transactions with HSBC and its subsidiaries. HSBC policy requires that these transactions occur at prevailing market rates and terms and include funding arrangements, derivatives, servicing arrangements, information technology, centralized support services, item and statement processing services, banking and other miscellaneous services. The following tables and discussions below present the more significant related party balances and the income (expense) generated by related party transactions for continuing operations:

HSBC Finance Corporation 

(1)   
    Securities under an agreement to resell are purchased from HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and generally have terms of   120   days or less. The collateral underlying the securities purchased under agreements to resell, however, is with an unaffiliated third party. Interest income recognized on these securities is reflected as interest income from HSBC affiliate in the table below. 
               (2)   
    Due to affiliates includes amounts owed to HSBC and its subsidiaries as a result of direct debt issuances and excludes preferred stock. 

(1)   
    Includes interest expense paid to HSBC affiliates for debt held by HSBC affiliates as well as net interest paid to or received from HSBC affiliates on risk management hedges related to non-affiliated debt. 
               (2)   
    Certain employees participate in one or more stock compensation plans sponsored by HSBC. These expenses are included in Salaries and employee benefits in our consolidated statement of income (loss). Certain employees also participate in a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans sponsored by HSBC North America which are discussed in Note 8,  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits.  
     Funding Arrangements with HSBC Affiliates: 
  All of our ongoing funding requirements have been integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plans and our funding requirements are currently sourced primarily through HSBC USA Inc. ("HSBC USA") or HSBC North America. Due to affiliates consists of the following: 

HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) S.A. and subsidiaries   - These debt agreements matured in April 2016. 
  HSBC USA Inc.   - We have a   $5.0 billion  ,   364  -day uncommitted unsecured revolving credit agreement with HSBC USA, which expires during the fourth quarter of 2017. The credit agreement allows for borrowings with maturities of up to   5   years. At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $3,012 million   was outstanding under this credit agreement with   $512 million   maturing in   September 2017  ,   $1.5 billion   maturing in   January 2018   and   $1.0 billion   maturing in   September 2018  . 
  HSBC Holdings plc   - We have a public subordinated debt issue with a carrying amount of   $3.0 billion   which matures in 2021. Of this amount, HSBC Holdings plc holds   $812 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $813 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  HSBC North America     Holdings Inc.   -     We had a   $600 million   loan agreement with HSBC North America which provided for   three     $200 million   borrowings with maturities between   2034   and   2035  . In July 2016, we fully repaid this   $600 million   loan agreement. In October 2015, we entered into a   $1.0 billion   loan agreement with HSBC North America which we prepaid in October 2016 with proceeds from receivable sales. 
  We have the following funding arrangements available with HSBC affiliates, although there are no outstanding balances at either   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  : 
  
   28 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

$1.0 billion  ,   364  -day uncommitted revolving credit facility with HSBC North America. This credit facility expires in   January 2017  . 
     In November 2013, we obtained a surety bond for   $2.5 billion   to secure a stay of execution of the partial judgment in the securities litigation while we appealed the judgment. This surety bond was guaranteed by HSBC North America and we paid HSBC North America an annual fee for providing the guarantee which was included as a component of interest expense. Given the mandate of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversing the judgment, during the third quarter of 2015 we terminated the surety bond and related guarantee by HSBC North America. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded   $4 million   related to the guarantee provided by HSBC North America prior to its termination. 
  As previously discussed, we maintain an overall risk management strategy that utilizes interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates related to affiliate and third-party debt liabilities. HSBC Bank USA is our sole counterparty in derivative transactions. The notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding with HSBC Bank USA totaled   $1.8 billion   and   $8.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value of our agreements with HSBC Bank USA required us to provide collateral to HSBC Bank USA of   $189 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $491 million   at   December 31, 2015  , all of which was provided in cash. See Note 6,  Derivative Financial Instruments,  for additional information about our derivative portfolio. 
  In addition to the lending arrangements discussed above, HSBC Investments (North America) Inc. holds   1,000   shares of Series C Preferred Stock. Dividends paid on the Series C Preferred Stock totaled   $21 million   and   $64 million   during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   $21 million   and   $64 million   during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. During periods in which there is an accumulated deficit, dividends on the Series C preferred stock are paid from additional paid-in-capital. 
  At   September 30, 2015  , we had a deposit totaling   $1,503 million   with HSBC Bank USA at current market rates. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we no longer maintained this deposit with HSBC Bank USA. Interest income earned on this deposit was included in interest income from HSBC affiliates in the table above and was insignificant during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . As the deposit was terminated prior to December 31, 2015, there was   no   interest income during three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Services Provided Between HSBC Affiliates: 
  Under multiple service level agreements, we provide services to and receive services from various HSBC affiliates. The following summarizes these activities: 
             
    HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. ("HSI") provides transaction assistance for our receivable sales program, including receivable valuation and other transaction related activities. We pay HSI a fee for these services for each sales transaction based on the unpaid principal balance of the receivables sold. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   we paid fees to HSI totaling   $1 million   and   $5 million  , respectively. Fees paid to HSI for these services during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were less than   $1 million  . The fees paid to HSI for these services are reported as a component of Gain (loss) on sale of real estate secured receivables. 
                
    Servicing activities for real estate secured receivables across North America are performed both by us and HSBC Bank USA. As a result, we receive servicing fees from HSBC Bank USA for services performed on their behalf and pay servicing fees to HSBC Bank USA for services performed on our behalf. The fees we receive from HSBC Bank USA are reported in Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates. This includes fees received for servicing real estate secured receivables (with a carrying amount of   $586 million   and   $696 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively) that we sold to HSBC Bank USA in   2003   and   2004  . Fees we pay to HSBC Bank USA are reported in Support services from HSBC affiliates. 
                
    We also provide various services to HSBC Bank USA, including processing activities and other operational and administrative support. Fees received for these services are included in Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates. 
                
    HSBC North America's technology and certain centralized support services including human resources, corporate affairs, risk management, legal, compliance, tax, finance and other shared services are centralized within HSBC Technology   Services (USA) Inc. ("HTSU") also provides certain item processing and statement processing activities for us. The fees we pay HTSU for the centralized support services and processing activities are included in Support services from HSBC affiliates. We also receive fees from HTSU for providing certain administrative services to them as well as receiving rental revenue from HTSU for certain office space. The fees and rental revenue we receive from HTSU are included in Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates.

We use HSBC Global Services Limited, an HSBC affiliate located outside of the United States, to provide various support services to our operations including among other areas, customer service, systems, collection and accounting functions. The expenses related to these services are included in Support services from HSBC affiliates. 
                
    Banking services and other miscellaneous services are provided by other subsidiaries of HSBC, including HSBC Bank USA, which are included in Support services from HSBC affiliates. 

We have   one   reportable segment: Consumer. Our Consumer segment consists of our run-off Consumer Lending and Mortgage Services businesses. While these businesses are operating in run-off, they do not qualify to be reported as discontinued operations. There have been no changes in measurement or composition of our segment reporting as compared with the presentation in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Our segment results are presented in accordance with the Group Reporting Basis which apply IFRSs as issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU, and, as a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the Group Reporting Basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources such as employees are primarily made on this basis. However, we continue to monitor liquidity, capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis. 
  We continue to review the financial information used to manage our businesses, including the scope and content of the U.S. GAAP financial data being reported to our Management and our Board. To the extent we make changes to this reporting, we will evaluate any impact such changes may have on our segment reporting. 
  A summary of differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are presented in Note 18, "Business Segments," in our 2015 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2015 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results.

     During the first quarter of 2016, management identified a calculation error in the loan impairment allowance model for the segment collectively evaluated for impairment. The cumulative impact of this item was an understatement of the loan impairment allowance at March 31, 2016. As a result, loan impairment charges during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   include an adjustment of approximately   $100 million   representing the cumulative impact of the correction of this error under the Group Reporting Basis of accounting and reporting policies. Loan impairment allowances under U.S. GAAP were unaffected. 
  Loan impairment charges for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were also impacted by an out of period adjustment which decreased net charge-offs by   $16 million   in order to properly reflect charge-offs for receivables which received a partial forgiveness of principal as a result of an account modification in prior periods.  

11. 
    Variable Interest Entities 

We consolidate variable interest entities ( VIE ) in which we hold a controlling financial interest as evidenced by the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and therefore are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. We take into account our entire involvement in a VIE (explicit or implicit) in identifying variable interests that individually or in the aggregate could be significant enough to warrant our designation as the primary beneficiary and hence require us to consolidate the VIE or otherwise require us to make appropriate disclosures. We consider our involvement to be potentially significant where we, among other things, (i) provide liquidity facilities to support the VIE's debt obligations, (ii) enter into derivative contracts to absorb the risks and benefits from the VIE or from the assets held by the VIE, (iii) provide a financial guarantee that covers assets held or liabilities issued by a VIE, (iv) sponsor the VIE in that we design, organize and structure the transaction; and (v) retain a financial or servicing interest in the VIE. 
  We are required to evaluate whether to consolidate a VIE when we first become involved and on an ongoing basis. In almost all cases, a qualitative analysis of our involvement in the entity provides sufficient evidence to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. In rare cases, a more detailed analysis to quantify the extent of variability to be absorbed by each variable interest holder is required to determine the primary beneficiary. 
  Consolidated VIEs    Historically, we have organized special purpose entities ( SPEs ) primarily to meet our funding needs through collateralized funding transactions. As part of these transactions, we transferred certain receivables to these trusts which in turn issued debt instruments collateralized by the transferred receivables. The entities used in these transactions are VIEs. As we are the servicer of the assets of these trusts and have retained the benefits and risks, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these trusts. Accordingly, we consolidate these entities and report the debt securities issued by them as secured financings in long-term debt. As a result, all receivables transferred in these secured financings remain and continue to remain on our balance sheet and the debt securities issued by them have remained and continue to be included in long-term debt. As all of our ongoing funding requirements have been integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plans, we no longer use collateralized funding transactions to meet our funding needs. 
  
   32 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

The assets and liabilities of the consolidated secured financing VIE consisted of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The assets of the consolidated VIE serve as collateral for the obligations of the VIE. The holders of the debt securities issued by these vehicles have no recourse to our general assets. 
  Unconsolidated VIEs    We do not have any unconsolidated VIEs. 

12. 
    Fair Value Measurements 

Accounting principles related to fair value measurements provide a framework for measuring fair value and focus on an exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal market (or in the absence of the principal market, the most advantageous market) accessible in an orderly transaction between willing market participants (the  Fair Value Framework ). Where required by the applicable accounting standards, assets and liabilities are measured at fair value using the  highest and best use  valuation premise. Fair value measurement guidance clarifies that financial instruments do not have alternative use and, as such, the fair value of financial instruments should be determined using an  in-exchange  valuation premise. Although the fair value measurement literature provides a valuation exception and permits an entity to measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities with offsetting credit risk and/or market risks based on the exit price it would receive or pay to transfer the net risk exposure of a group of assets or liabilities if certain conditions are met, we have not elected to make fair value adjustments to a group of derivative instruments with offsetting credit and market risks. 
  Fair Value Adjustments    The best evidence of fair value is quoted market price in an actively traded market, where available. In the event listed price or market quotes are not available, valuation techniques that incorporate relevant transaction data and market parameters reflecting the attributes of the asset or liability under consideration are applied. Where applicable, fair value adjustments are made to ensure the financial instruments are appropriately recorded at fair value. The fair value adjustments reflect the risks associated with the products, contractual terms of the transactions, and the liquidity of the markets in which the transactions occur.  
  Credit risk adjustment   - The credit risk adjustment is an adjustment to a group of financial assets or financial liabilities to reflect the credit quality of the parties to the transaction in arriving at fair value. A credit valuation adjustment to a financial asset is required to reflect the default risk of the counterparty. Where applicable, we take into consideration the credit risk mitigating arrangements including collateral agreements and master netting arrangements in estimating the credit risk adjustments. 
  
   33

Valuation Control Framework    A control framework has been established which is designed to ensure that fair values are validated by a function independent of the risk-taker. To that end, the ultimate responsibility for the measurement of fair values rests with the HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee. The HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee establishes policies and procedures to ensure appropriate valuations. Fair values for long-term debt for which we have elected fair value option are measured by a third-party valuation source (pricing service) by reference to external quotations on the identical or similar instruments. Once fair values have been obtained from the third-party valuation source, an independent price validation process is performed and reviewed by the HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee. For price validation purposes, we obtain quotations from at least one other independent pricing source for each financial instrument, where possible. We consider the following factors in determining fair values: 
             
    similarities between the asset or the liability under consideration and the asset or liability for which quotation is received;  
                
    collaboration of pricing by reference to other independent market data such as market transactions and relevant benchmark indices; 
                
    whether the security is traded in an active or inactive market; 
                
    consistency among different pricing sources; 
                
    the valuation approach and the methodologies used by the independent pricing sources in determining fair value; 
                
    the elapsed time between the date to which the market data relates and the measurement date; and 
                
    the manner in which the fair value information is sourced. 
     Greater weight is given to quotations of instruments with recent market transactions, pricing quotes from dealers who stand ready to transact, quotations provided by market-makers who originally underwrote such instruments, and market consensus pricing based on inputs from a large number of participants. Any significant discrepancies among the external quotations are reviewed by management and adjustments to fair values are recorded where appropriate. 
  Fair values for derivatives are determined by management using valuation techniques, valuation models and inputs that are developed, reviewed, validated and approved by the Markets Independent Model Review Team of an HSBC affiliate. The models used apply appropriate control processes and procedures to ensure that the derived inputs are used to value only those instruments that share similar risk to the relevant benchmark indexes and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors. 
  We have various controls over our valuation process and procedures for receivables held for sale. As these fair values are generally determined using value estimates from third party and affiliate valuation specialists, the controls may include analytical reviews of quarterly value trends, corroboration of inputs by observable market data, direct discussion with potential investors and results of actual sales of such receivable, all of which are submitted to the HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee for review. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments    The fair value estimates, methods and assumptions set forth below for our financial instruments, including those financial instruments carried at cost, are made solely to comply with disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in this Form 10-Q. The following table summarizes the carrying values and estimated fair value of our financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

    Real estate owned is required to be reported on the balance sheet net of transactions costs. The real estate owned amounts in the table above reflect the fair value of the underlying asset unadjusted for transaction costs. 
     Significant Transfers Between Level 1 and Level 2   There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or 2015. 
  Significant Transfers Between Level 2 and Level 3   We transferred real estate secured receivables held for sale from Level 3 to Level 2 prior to the sale of these receivables totaling   $757 million   and   $5,683 million   during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   $1,635 million   and   $2,077 million  , respectively, during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Receivables held for sale are reclassified from Level 3 to Level 2 upon receipt of an offer from a third party to purchase a distinct pool of receivables for a specified purchase price. 
  The following table presents quantitative information about non-recurring fair value measurements of assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the weighted average collateral loss severity rate was   47 percent   and   42 percent  , respectively, taking into consideration both expected net cash flows as well as current collateral values. 
     Valuation Techniques    The following summarizes the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on both a recurring and non-recurring basis and for estimating fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value but for which fair value disclosures are required. 
  Cash:    Carrying amount approximates fair value due to the liquid nature of cash. 
  Securities purchased under agreements to resell:    The fair value of securities purchased under agreements to resell approximates carrying amount due to the short-term maturity of the agreements. 
  Receivables held for investment and receivables held for sale:    The estimated fair value of our receivables held for investment and receivables held for sale is determined by developing an approximate range of value from a mix of various sources appropriate for the respective pools of assets aggregated by similar risk characteristics. These sources include recently observed over-the-counter transactions where available and fair value estimates obtained from an HSBC affiliate and, for receivables held for sale, a third party valuation specialist for distinct pools of receivables. These fair value estimates are based on discounted cash flow models using assumptions we believe are consistent with those that would be used by market participants in valuing such receivables and trading inputs from other market participants which includes observed primary and secondary trades.  
  Valuation inputs include estimates of future interest rates, prepayment speeds, default and loss curves, estimated collateral values (including expenses to be incurred to maintain the collateral) and market discount rates reflecting management's estimate of the rate of return that would be required by investors in the current market given the specific characteristics and inherent credit risk of the receivables and receivables held for sale. Some of these inputs are influenced by collateral value changes and unemployment rates. We perform analytical reviews of fair value changes on a quarterly basis and periodically validate our valuation methodologies and assumptions based on the results of actual sales of such receivables. We also may hold discussions on value directly with potential investors. Since some receivables pools may have features which are unique, the fair value measurement processes use significant unobservable inputs which are specific to the performance characteristics of the various receivable portfolios. 
  Real estate owned:    Fair value is determined based on third party valuations obtained at the time we take title to the property and, if less than the carrying amount of the receivable, the carrying amount of the receivable is adjusted to the fair value less estimated cost to sell. The carrying amount of the property is further reduced, if necessary, at least every   45 days   to reflect observable local market data, including local area sales data. 
  Due from affiliates:    Carrying amount approximates fair value because the interest rates on these receivables adjust with changing market interest rates. 
  Long-term debt and Due to affiliates:    Fair value is primarily determined by a third party valuation source. The pricing services source fair value from quoted market prices and, if not available, expected cash flows are discounted using the appropriate interest rate for the applicable duration of the instrument adjusted for our own credit risk (spread). The credit spreads applied to these instruments are derived from the spreads recognized in the secondary market for similar debt as of the measurement date. Where available, relevant trade data is also considered as part of our validation process. 
  Derivative financial assets and liabilities:    Derivative values are defined as the amount we would receive or pay to extinguish the contract using a market participant at the reporting date. The values are determined by management using a pricing system maintained by HSBC Bank USA. In determining these values, HSBC Bank USA uses quoted market prices, when available. For  
  
   38 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

non-exchange traded contracts, such as interest rate swaps, fair value is determined using discounted cash flow modeling techniques. Valuation models calculate the present value of expected future cash flows based on models that utilize independently-sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, option volatilities, and currency rates. Valuations may be adjusted in order to ensure that those values represent appropriate estimates of fair value. These adjustments are generally required to reflect factors such as market liquidity and counterparty credit risk that can affect prices in arms-length transactions with unrelated third parties. Finally, other transaction specific factors such as the variety of valuation models available, the range of unobservable model inputs and other model assumptions can affect estimates of fair value. Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded for a particular position. 
  Counterparty credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of a financial asset. The Fair Value Framework specifies that the fair value of a liability should reflect the entity's non-performance risk and accordingly, the effect of our own credit risk (spread) has been factored into the determination of the fair value of our financial liabilities, including derivative instruments. In estimating the credit risk adjustment to the derivative assets and liabilities, we take into account the impact of netting and/or collateral arrangements that are designed to mitigate counterparty credit risk. 

13.    Litigation and Regulatory Matters                 

The following supplements, and should be read together with, the disclosure in Note 22, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in our 2015 Form 10-K and in Note 14, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in our Form 10-Q for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 (the "2016 First Quarter Form 10-Q") and our Form 10-Q for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 (the "2016 Second Quarter Form 10-Q"). Only matters with significant updates and new matters since our disclosure in our 2015 Form 10-K, 2016 First Quarter Form 10-Q and 2016 Second Quarter Form 10-Q are reported herein. 
  In addition to the matters described below and in our 2015 Form 10-K, 2016 First Quarter Form 10-Q and 2016 Second Quarter Form 10-Q, in the ordinary course of business, we are routinely named as defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings relating to activities of our current and/or former operations. These legal actions and proceedings may include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or for injunctive relief. In the ordinary course of business, we also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal), certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators, we receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with various aspects of our regulated activities. 
  In view of the inherent unpredictability of legal matters, including litigation, governmental and regulatory matters, particularly where the damages sought are substantial or indeterminate or when the proceedings or investigations are in the early stages, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters or the eventual loss, fines, penalties or business impact, if any, that may result. We establish reserves for litigation, governmental and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated. Once established, reserves are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The actual costs of resolving litigation and regulatory matters, however, may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved for those matters.  
  For the legal matters disclosed below, including litigation, governmental and regulatory matters, as well as for the legal matters disclosed in Note 22, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in our 2015 Form 10-K and in Note 14, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in the 2016 First Quarter Form 10-Q and 2016 Second Quarter Form 10-Q as to which a loss in excess of accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods and for which there is sufficient currently available information on the basis of which we believe we can make a reliable estimate, we believe a reasonable estimate could be as much as   $390 million   for HSBC Finance Corporation. The legal matters underlying this estimate of possible loss will change from time to time and actual results may differ significantly from this current estimate. 
  Given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in any particular quarterly or annual period.

    New Accounting Pronouncements  

The following new accounting pronouncement was adopted effective January 1, 2016: 
             
    Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") which rescinds the deferral of VIE consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in certain investment funds and provides a new scope exception to registered money market funds and similar unregistered money market funds. The ASU makes several other amendments including a) the elimination of certain criteria previously used for determining whether fees paid to a decision maker represent a variable interest; b) revising the consolidation model for limited partnerships and similar entities which could be variable interest entities or voting interest entities; c) excluding certain fees paid to a decision maker from the risk and benefit test in the primary beneficiary determination if certain conditions are met; and d) reduces the application of the related party guidance for VIEs. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
     The following are accounting pronouncements which will be adopted in future periods: 
             
    Financial Instruments - Classification and Measurement   In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which changes aspects of its guidance on classification and measurement of financial instruments. The ASU requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Under a practicability exception, entities may measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment. Under this exception, a qualitative assessment for impairment will be required and, if impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investments must be adjusted to their fair value and an impairment loss recognized in net income. For financial liabilities measured under the fair value option, the ASU requires recognizing the change in fair value attributable to our own credit in other comprehensive income. Additionally, the ASU requires new disclosure related to equity investments and modifies certain disclosure requirements related to the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for all annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018 and the guidance should be applied by recording a cumulative effect adjustment to the balance sheet or, as it relates to equity investments without readily determinable fair values, prospectively. Early adoption of the amendment related to financial liabilities measured under the fair value option is permitted. The adoption of this guidance related to financial liabilities measured under the fair value option will have a significant impact on our financial statements and will result in recognizing the change in fair value attributable to our own credit risk in other comprehensive income where previously these amounts were recognized in net income. The adoption of this guidance will also require a cumulative effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet, which will result in a reclassification from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the remaining guidance in this ASU.

HSBC Finance Corporation 

Leases   In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which requires a lessee to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months. Lease classification will determine whether a lease is reported as a financing transaction in the income statement and statement of cash flows. The ASU does not substantially change lessor accounting, but it does make certain changes related to leases for which collectability of the lease payments is uncertain or there are significant variable payments. Additionally, the ASU makes several other targeted amendments including a) revising the definition of lease payments to include fixed payments by the lessee to cover lessor costs related to ownership of the underlying asset such as for property taxes or insurance; b) narrowing the definition of initial direct costs which an entity is permitted to capitalize to include only those incremental costs of a lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained; c) requiring seller-lessees in a sale-leaseback transaction to recognize the entire gain from the sale of the underlying asset at the time of sale rather than over the leaseback term; and d) expanding disclosures to provide quantitative and qualitative information about lease transactions. The ASU is effective for all annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019 and is required to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented at the date of initial application, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU. 
                
    Compensation - Stock Compensation   In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies for share-based payment awards to be recorded as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement and for excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. Under the ASU, entities elect whether to account for forfeitures of awards by either recognizing forfeitures as they occur or by estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited. Additionally, the ASU allows entities to withhold up to the maximum individual statutory tax rate to cover income taxes on awards and classify the entire awards as equity. Cash paid to satisfy the statutory income tax withholding obligation must be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for all annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in the ASU have various transition requirements with certain amendments required to be applied retrospectively. We do not anticipate a significant impact upon adoption of this ASU. 
                
    Financial Instruments - Credit Impairment   In June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The ASU requires entities to estimate and recognize an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for loans (including TDR Loans), trade receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, off-balance sheet credit exposures and certain other financial assets measured at amortized cost. The ASU also requires changes in accounting for purchased credit impaired loans. The ASU includes new disclosure requirements, including information about how an entity developed its allowance for financial assets measured at cost, including changes in the factors that influenced the estimate of expected credit losses and the reason for those changes as well as disaggregation of credit quality indicators by year of origination for financing receivables. The ASU is effective for all annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2019, and requires a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. We currently do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations as our entire receivable portfolio is now classified as held for sale. 
                
    Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments    In August 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be classified in the statement of cash flows. Under the ASU, cash proceeds from the settlement of bank-owned life insurance policies should be classified as cash inflows from investing activities. The ASU is effective for all annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018 and is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU. 
     There have been no additional accounting pronouncements issued during the first   nine   months of 2016 that are expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Executive Overview 

Organization and Basis of Reporting    HSBC Finance Corporation and its subsidiaries are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of HSBC North America, which is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc ( HSBC  and, together with its subsidiaries, "HSBC Group"). HSBC Finance Corporation and its subsidiaries may also be referred to in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) as  we ,  us  or  our . 
  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations excludes the results of our discontinued operations unless otherwise noted. See Note 3,  Discontinued Operations,  in our 2015 Form 10-K for further discussion of these operations. 
  Economic Environment    The U.S. economy continued its trend of slow growth during the first nine months of 2016. U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") is currently forecast to grow at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in 2016, slightly lower than 2015's GDP growth rate of 2.1 percent. Consumer sentiment in September 2016 remained relatively flat from December 2015 levels, reflecting a gradual improvement in assessments of current conditions and an increasingly more positive view by consumers of their personal finances, offset by an expectation that the slow pace of economic growth will likely put an end to further meaningful declines in the unemployment rate.  
  The U.S. economy added approximately 1.6 million jobs during the first nine months of 2016 although total unemployment remained unchanged at 5.0 percent at September 2016 as compared with December 2015 as the number of job seekers continued to grow. While long-term unemployment decreased by approximately 5 percent during the first nine months of 2016, economic headwinds remain as wage growth remains under pressure, an elevated number of part-time workers continue to seek full-time work and the number of discouraged people who have stopped looking for work remains elevated, as evidenced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' U-6 unemployment rate of 9.7 percent at September 2016, as compared with a rate of 9.9 percent at year-end. In addition, economic uncertainty remains high in many economies outside the U.S., where economic activity continues to be slow, with the decision by the United Kingdom in late June to exit the European Union ("EU") further adding to this uncertainty. The sustainability of the economic recovery will be determined by numerous variables including consumer sentiment, energy prices, credit market volatility, employment levels and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets. These conditions in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal policy, geopolitical concerns and the heightened regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2016 and beyond.

While the housing market in the U.S. continues to recover, the strength of recovery varies by market. Certain courts and state legislatures have issued rules or statutes relating to foreclosures and scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts. Also, in some areas, officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding. The combination of these factors has led to increased delays in several jurisdictions which will continue to take time to resolve. 
  2016 Events  
             
    As discussed in prior filings, since 2007 we have been engaged in an on-going evaluation of our operations as we seek to optimize our risk profile and cost structure as well as our liquidity, capital and funding requirements. As part of this on-going evaluation, in September 2016, we further expanded our receivable sales program to include all remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment as we no longer have the intent to hold these receivables. This decision further accelerates our run-off strategy and, as a result, during the third quarter of 2016, we recorded pre-tax expense of   $31 million   for severance and loan review costs. We will continue to incur loan review costs in future periods as we prepare these receivables for sale. 
                
    As a result of classifying all receivables as held for sale, at September 30, 2016 real estate secured receivables held for sale totaled   $10.1 billion  . While we expect that substantially all of these receivables will be sold in multiple transactions through 2017, the actual time to complete these sales and ultimate earnings impact depends on many factors, including future market conditions. As we continue to make progress in our strategy to run-off and sell our real estate secured receivable portfolio, we will see declines in net interest income. Decreases in operating expenses may not necessarily decline in line with the run-off and sale of our receivable portfolio as a result of certain fixed costs. Accordingly, net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or any prior periods should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods. 
     During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   we transferred real estate secured receivables to held for sale (including the expansion of the receivable sales program in September 2016 discussed above) with a total unpaid principal balance (excluding accrued interest) of approximately   $8,219 million   and   $8,577 million  , respectively, at the time of transfer. The carrying value of these receivables prior to transfer after considering the fair value of the property less cost to sell, as applicable, was approximately   $8,087 million   and   $8,429 million  , respectively, including accrued interest. As we plan to sell these receivables to third party investors, fair value represents the price we believe a third party investor would pay to acquire the receivable portfolios. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables transferred to held for sale of   $562 million  , of which   $557 million   was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income (loss) and   $5 million   was attributable to non-credit factors and recorded as a component of other revenues in the consolidated statement of income (loss). During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables transferred to held for sale totaling   $587 million  , of which   $576 million   was attributed to credit factors and   $11 million   was attributable to non-credit factors. 
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $15 million   and   $145 million  , respectively, of additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables held for sale as a component of total other revenues in the consolidated statement of income (loss) related to changes in fair value as a result of establishing separate pools for receivables being marketed. Removing these receivables from their risk-based grouping impacts the valuation of the receivables remaining in the risked-based pools. Fair value estimates, which may either be credit or non-credit related, are influenced by numerous factors, such as market participants' assumptions regarding future customer payment patterns, changes in default rates, estimated costs to obtain properties, risked-based grouping of receivables for determination of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment, home prices and investors' required returns, amongst others, some of which are outside of our control. These factors have been highly volatile in recent years. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of receivables held for sale during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   should not be considered indicative of fair value changes in future periods as deterioration in the factors noted above would likely require further increases to our valuation allowance in future periods. 
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold real estate secured receivables with an unpaid principal balance of   $930 million   (aggregate carrying value of   $714 million  ) and   $5,652 million   (aggregate carrying value of   $4,933 million  ), respectively, at the time of sale to third-party investors. Aggregate cash consideration received totaled   $715 million   and   $5,382 million   during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We realized a   loss   of   $5 million   and a   gain   of   $418 million  , including transaction costs, during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  See Note 4,  Receivables Held for Sale,  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding receivables held for sale.

As discussed more fully in Note 13, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in June 2016, we agreed to pay   $1,575 million   to settle all claims of the outstanding securities litigation. As a result, we recorded a provision for securities litigation liability of   $575 million   during the second quarter of 2016.  
                
    Previously we entered into interest rate swaps which were not designated as hedges under derivative accounting principles and were primarily used to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates through more closely matching both the structure and duration of our liabilities to the structure and duration of our assets. As we continue to make progress in our strategy to accelerate the run-off and sales of our real estate secured receivable portfolio, the dynamics of the duration of our receivables due to lower prepayment rates and the corresponding increase in interest rate risk are changing. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we began reducing the size of this portfolio of interest rate swaps. During the second quarter of 2016, we terminated all of the remaining interest rate swaps in this portfolio of non-qualifying hedges. As a result of the elimination of our non-qualifying hedge portfolio, derivative related income (expense) will only reflect ineffectiveness for derivatives that are qualifying hedges beginning in the third quarter of 2016 and future periods. 
                
    On June 30, 2016, we redeemed all of the outstanding preferred shares of the 6.36 percent Non-Cumulative Series B preferred stock for $575 million. Accordingly, at June 30, 2016, the Series B preferred securities are no longer outstanding. 
     Performance, Developments and Trends    The following table sets forth selected financial highlights of HSBC Finance Corporation for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 and at   September 30, 2016  , June 30, 2016 and   December 31, 2015  .

    See "Results of Operations" for a detailed discussion of trends in our net interest margin and efficiency ratio. 
               (2)   
    The net charge-off ratio was impacted in all periods by the transfer of additional receivables to held for sale, although the impact was more pronounced in the current year periods as a result of the decision in September 2016 to transfer to held for sale all of the remaining receivables classified as held for investment. See "Credit Quality" for a detailed discussion of the trends in our credit loss reserve levels as well as our delinquency and charge-off ratios.

     We reported a net   loss   of   $404 million   and   $612 million   during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with net   loss   of   $37 million   and   $258 million   during the year-ago periods. 
  Loss from continuing operations was   $406 million   and   $606 million   during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with a   loss   from continuing operations of   $37 million   and   $250 million   during the year-ago periods. We reported a   loss   from continuing operations before income tax of   $609 million   and   $928 million   during the three and   nine   months ended   September

30, 2016   compared with a   loss   from continuing operations before income tax of   $166 million   and   $607 million   during the year-ago periods. The higher loss from continuing operations before income tax during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was driven by a higher provision for credit losses, lower net interest income and during the year-to-date period higher operating expenses, partially offset by the impact of higher other revenues.  
  Our reported results in all periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant, which distorts comparability between periods. Significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends. The following table summarizes the impact of these significant items for all periods presented: 

(1)   
    Costs to achieve reflects transformation costs to deliver the cost reduction and productivity outcomes outlined in the HSBC Investor Update in June 2015. The amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 reflect severance costs and file review costs associated with the receivable sales program.  
               (2)   
    Represents a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. 
     Excluding the impact of the items presented in the table above, adjusted performance from continuing operations before income tax during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   declined by   $535 million   and   $54 million  , respectively, compared with the year-ago periods. The decline was driven by a higher provision for credit losses and to a lesser extent lower net interest income, partially offset by lower operating expenses and, during the year-to-date period, higher other revenues. The higher provision for credit losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was driven by the transfer to held for sale in September 2016 of the remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment. The lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment for receivables transferred to held for sale in September 2016 totaled   $541 million   which was attributable to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses. Higher other revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects an increase of   $398 million   between periods for gains recognized on sales of real estate secured receivables, partially offset by a lower gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives excluding the impact of changes in credit spread as well as the impact of a non-recurrence of a large release in the provision for estimated repurchase liabilities during the third quarter of 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, other revenues were lower as improvements in the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment were offset by a large release in the provision for estimated repurchase liabilities during the third quarter of 2015 which did not occur in the current year periods. 
  See "Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see "Receivables Review" for further discussion on our receivable trends, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on funding and capital and "Credit Quality" for additional discussion on our credit trends. 
  We continue to evaluate our operations as we seek to optimize our risk profile and cost efficiencies as well as our liquidity, capital and funding requirements. This could result in further strategic actions that may include changes to our legal structure, outstanding debt levels or cost structure in support of HSBC's strategic priorities. We also continue to focus on cost optimization efforts to create a more sustainable cost structure. Over the past several years, we have taken various opportunities to reduce costs through organizational structure redesign, vendor spending, discretionary spending, outsourcing and other general efficiency initiatives which have resulted in workforce reductions. Our focus on cost optimization is continuing and, as a result, we may incur restructuring charges in future periods, the amount of which will depend upon the actions that ultimately are implemented. 
  Funding and Capital    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, we did not receive any capital contributions from HSBC Investments (North America) Inc. ("HINO"). During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, we retired or called   $5,074 million   and   $3,805 million  , respectively, of term debt and we redeemed all of the outstanding preferred securities of the 6.36 percent Non-Cumulative Series B preferred stock for $575 million. These cash requirements in the first nine months of 2016 were met from cash generated from operations, including receivable sales, liquidation of short-term investments and

balance sheet attrition. The primary driver of our liquidity during the remainder of 2016 will be cash generated from operations, including balance sheet attrition, and continued liquidation of our receivable portfolio. However, lower cash flow as a result of declining receivable balances may not provide sufficient cash to fully repay maturing debt in future periods. As we continue to liquidate our receivable portfolios, HSBC's continued support will be required to properly manage our business operations and maintain appropriate levels of capital. HSBC has historically provided significant capital in support of our operations and has indicated that it is fully committed and has the capacity and willingness to continue that support.  

Basis of Reporting 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ). Unless noted, the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations included in MD A are presented on a continuing operations basis of reporting. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.  
  In addition to the U.S. GAAP financial results reported in our consolidated financial statements, we report financial information to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the IASB and as endorsed by the EU and, as a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). For a reconciliation of Group Reporting Basis results to the comparable U.S. GAAP reported results, see Note 10,  Business Segments,  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
  Because operating results on the Group Reporting Basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees, our management also separately monitors net income under this basis of reporting. The following table reconciles our U.S. GAAP versus Group Reporting Basis net income (loss): 

During the first quarter of 2016, management identified a calculation error in the loan impairment allowance model for the segment collectively evaluated for impairment. The cumulative impact of this item was an understatement of the loan impairment allowance at March 31, 2016. As a result, loan impairment charges during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   include an adjustment of approximately   $100 million   representing the cumulative impact of the correction of an error under the Group Reporting Basis of accounting and reporting policies. Loan impairment allowances under U.S. GAAP were unaffected. 
  A summary of differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results is presented in our 2015 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2015 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results.

Receivables Review 

The following table summarizes receivables held for investment and receivables held for sale at   September 30, 2016   and increases (decreases) since June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

               (1)   
    See Note 4, "Receivables Held for Sale," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for detail information related to the movements in the real estate secured receivables held for sale balances between periods. 
     Real estate secured receivables held for investment      The decrease since June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 primarily reflects the decision to transfer all receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale in September 2016. To a lesser extent the decrease as compared with both periods also reflects continued liquidation of the receivable portfolio. Liquidation rates in our real estate secured receivable portfolio continued to be impacted by low receivable prepayments as few refinancing opportunities exist for our customers. 
  Receivables held for sale    Receivables held for sale totaled   $10,148 million   at September 30, 2016 compared with $3,796 million at June 30, 2016 and $8,265 million at December 31, 2015. The increase as compared with both periods primarily reflects the decision to transfer all of the remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale in September 2016. This increase was partially offset by the impact of receivable sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 with an aggregate carrying value of   $714 million   and   $4,933 million  , respectively, which resulted in a   loss   on sale of   $5 million   and a   gain   on sale of   $418 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. To a lesser extent, the increase was also partially offset by continued liquidation in the portfolio as well as the impact of additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment during the current year periods. 
  See Note 4, "Receivables Held for Sale," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of receivables held for sale.

Real Estate Owned      

The following table provides quarterly information regarding our real estate owned ("REO") properties:  

(1)   
    Property acquired through foreclosure is initially recognized at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell ( Initial REO Carrying Amount ). The average loss (gain) on sale of REO properties is calculated as cash proceeds less the Initial REO Carrying Amount divided by the unpaid principal balance prior to write-down (excluding any accrued interest income) plus certain other ancillary disbursements that, by law, are reimbursable from the cash proceeds (e.g., real estate tax advances) and were incurred prior to our taking title to the property and does not include holding costs on REO properties. This ratio represents the portion of our total loss (gain) on foreclosed properties that occurred after we took title to the property. 
               (2)   
    The average total loss on foreclosed properties sold each quarter includes both the loss on sale of the REO property as discussed above and the cumulative write-downs recognized on the receivable up to the time we took title to the property. This calculation of the average total loss on foreclosed properties uses the unpaid principal balance prior to write-down (excluding any accrued interest income) plus certain other ancillary disbursements that, by law, are reimbursable from the cash proceeds (e.g., real estate tax advances) and were incurred prior to the date we took title to the property and does not include holding costs on REO properties. 
     During 2015, the servicing activities related to our REO portfolio were performed either in-house or outsourced to a third-party. During the second quarter of 2016, we decided to bring the servicing of our entire REO portfolio in-house. This transition was completed during the third quarter of 2016. 
  The number of REO properties held at   September 30, 2016   decreased as compared with June 30, 2016 as we sold more REO properties than were added to inventory. Our receivable sales program will continue to impact the number of REO properties added to inventory during the remainder of 2016. 
  The average loss (gain) on sale of REO properties and the average total loss on foreclosed properties was essentially flat during the third quarter of 2016 as compared with the prior quarter. The average time to sell REO properties (in days) improved during the third quarter of 2016 reflecting ongoing enhancements to our REO liquidation strategy which resulted in shorter times to sell. While we continue to monitor and enhance our REO liquidation strategy, our receivable sales program creates a certain level of volatility in the average loss (gain) on sale of REO properties and the average total loss on foreclosed properties as well as the average time to sell REO properties, which we anticipate will continue going forward.

Results of Operations 

Unless noted otherwise, the following discusses amounts from continuing operations as reported in our consolidated statement of income. 
  Net Interest Income    The following table summarizes net interest income and net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

(1)   
    % Columns: comparison to average interest-earning assets. 
     Net interest income decreased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to the following:  
             
    Average receivable levels decreased as a result of real estate secured receivable liquidation. 
                
    During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , overall yields on total average interest earning assets increased driven by a shift in mix of total average interest earning assets to a lower percentage of short-term investments which have significantly lower yields than our receivable portfolio. Overall yields on total average interest earning assets were negatively impacted during the three months ended September 30, 2016 by lower receivable yields reflecting a lower impact from changes in yield assumptions on receivables participating in payment incentive programs. However, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, receivable yields increased as the impact of lower changes in yield assumptions on receivable participating in payment incentive programs was more than offset by the impact of lower levels of nonaccrual real estate secured receivables.  
                
    Interest expense decreased as a result of lower average borrowings, partially offset by the impact of higher average rates due to the maturing of certain lower rate long-term borrowings since September 30, 2015. Higher average rates also reflect the impact of increases in rates on certain variable rate debt during the first quarter of 2016. 
     Net interest margin was   3.43 percent   and   3.49 percent   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with   3.09 percent   and   2.65 percent   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in net interest margin during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflects the impact of higher overall yields on total average interest earning assets due to a shift in the mix of total average interest earning assets to a lower percentage of short-term investments and, in the year-to-date period, higher receivable yields as discussed above. Cost of funds as a percentage of average interest earning assets improved during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as interest expense decreased at a faster pace than average interest earning assets. The following table summarizes the significant trends affecting the comparability of net interest income and net interest margin:

The varying maturities and repricing frequencies of both our assets and liabilities expose us to interest rate risk. When the various risks inherent in both the asset and the debt do not meet our desired risk profile, we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks to acceptable interest rate risk levels. See  Risk Management  for additional information regarding interest rate risk and derivative financial instruments. 
  Provision for Credit Losses    The following table summarizes provision for credit losses by product: 

The provision for credit losses for real estate secured receivables increased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with the year-ago periods. The provision for credit losses in all periods was impacted by the recording of lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments related to credit factors on receivables transferred to held for sale, although the impact was more pronounced in the current year periods as a result of the decision in September 2016 to transfer to held for sale all of the receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio. These adjustments reflect the differences between amortized cost and the amount we believe a third party investor would pay to acquire the receivables, which takes into consideration factors that are not relevant under the incurred loss model in establishing credit loss reserves for receivables held for investment, such as life time losses and the discounting of cash flows. When there is no objective, verifiable evidence to indicate non-credit factors are present, the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of provision for credit losses.  
  The remainder of the provision for credit losses was higher during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the year-ago periods. While all periods were positively impacted by lower loss estimates due to lower receivable levels and the impact of lower dollars of delinquency on accounts less than 180 days delinquent, as well as lower reserve requirements on troubled debt restructurings ( TDR Loans ), the impact was more pronounced during the prior year periods. Additionally, the provision for credit losses during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was also impacted by a release of approximately $19 million associated with a correction to our credit loss reserve calculation for a segment of our portfolio.  
  Net charge-off dollars totaled   $826 million   and   $932 million  , respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with   $85 million   and   $2,113 million  , respectively, during the year-ago periods. Dollars of net charge-offs during all periods were impacted by the transfer of additional receivables to held for sale, although the impact was more pronounced in the current year periods as a result of the decision in September 2016 to transfer to held for sale all of the remaining receivables classified as held for investment. Credit loss reserves existing at the time of transfer are recorded as additional charge-off upon transfer and totaled   $244 million   and   $268 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively,  
  
   51 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

compared with   $24 million   and   $1,617 million  , respectively, during the year-ago periods. Additionally, the credit portion of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded at the time of transfer to receivables held for sale was recorded as additional charge-off and totaled   $557 million   and   $576 million   during three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with   $12 million   and   $232 million   during the year-ago periods. Excluding the impact of charge-off dollars associated with receivables transferred to held for sale during all periods, dollars of net charge-offs decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflecting lower levels of receivables held for investment and lower charge-off on accounts that reach 180 days contractual delinquency reflecting improved credit quality as a result of improvements in economic conditions and home prices since September 30, 2015. See  Credit Quality  for further discussion of our net charge-offs. 
  Subsequent to the transfer of receivables to held for sale, no further provision for credit losses or charge-offs are recorded as receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. As a result of transferring all the remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale in September 2016, no provision for credit losses or charge-offs will be recorded in future periods. 
  Other Revenues    The following table summarizes the components of other revenues:

  Derivative related income (expense)   includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives which did not qualify as effective hedges under hedge accounting principles and ineffectiveness on derivatives which are qualifying hedges. Designation of swaps as effective hedges reduces the volatility that would otherwise result from mark-to-market accounting. All derivatives are economic hedges of the underlying debt instruments regardless of the accounting treatment. The following table summarizes derivative related income (expense) for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015:

Previously we entered into interest rate swaps which were not designated as hedges under derivative accounting principles. These financial instruments were economic hedges but did not qualify for hedge accounting and were primarily used to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates through more closely matching both the structure and duration of our liabilities to the structure and duration of our assets. As we continued to make progress in our strategy to accelerate the run-off and sales of our real estate secured receivable portfolio, the dynamics of the duration of our receivables due to lower prepayment rates and the corresponding increase in interest rate risk began changing. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we began reducing the size of this portfolio of interest rate swaps. In May 2016, we terminated all of the remaining interest rate swaps in this portfolio of non-qualifying hedges. As a result of the elimination of our non-qualifying hedge portfolio, derivative related income (expense) in future periods will only reflect ineffectiveness for derivatives that are qualifying hedges. 
  Derivative related income (expense) improved during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with the year-ago periods. The components of derivative related income (expense) are discussed below: 
             
    Net realized losses   improved during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as a result of fewer non-qualifying hedges outstanding since September 30, 2015. There were no realized losses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the termination of this portfolio of non-qualifying hedges during the second quarter as discussed above. 
                
    Mark-to-market on derivatives in our non-qualifying hedge portfolio   was lower during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with the year-ago period reflecting the impact of falling rates which had occurred prior to the termination of the swaps, which was more pronounced than the impact of falling rates in the prior year period. There was no mark-to-market on derivatives in our non-qualifying hedge portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the termination of this portfolio of non-qualifying hedges during the second quarter as discussed above. 
                
    Hedge accounting ineffectiveness   during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 was primarily related to our cross currency cash flow hedges that are approaching maturity. 
     Net income volatility in future periods has been reduced as a result of the elimination of our non-qualifying hedge portfolio. Derivative related income (expense) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or any prior periods should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods. 
  Gain (loss) on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives   reflects fair value changes on our fixed rate debt accounted for under fair value option ("FVO") as well as the fair value changes and realized gains (losses) on the related derivatives associated with debt designated at fair value. Gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives decreased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with the year-ago periods primarily due to lower net realized gains in the current year periods as a result of fewer derivative positions as our fair value option debt and related derivatives mature. See Note 5,  Fair Value Option,  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information, including a break out of the components of the gain (loss) on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives. 
  Net income volatility, whether based on changes in the interest rate or credit risk components of the mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value and the related derivatives, impacts the comparability of our reported results between periods. The gain (loss) on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods. 
  Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates   represents revenue received under service level agreements under which we service real estate secured receivables as well as rental revenue from HSBC Technology   Services (USA) Inc. ( HTSU ) for certain office and administrative costs. Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates decreased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to lower rental income as a result of the sale of a data center located in Vernon Hills, Illinois to HTSU during the third quarter of 2015.

Lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables held for sale   during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 is summarized in the following table: 

During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables transferred to held for sale totaling   $562 million   and   $587 million  , respectively, of which   $5 million   and   $11 million  , respectively, was attributable to non-credit factors and recorded as a component of other revenues in the consolidated statement of income (loss). The remainder of the total initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment for three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , of   $557 million   and   $576 million  , respectively, was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses as there was no objective, verifiable evidence to indicate non-credit factors were associated with the decline in fair value. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of   $12 million   and   $232 million  , respectively, all of which was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses as there was no objective, verifiable evidence to indicate non-credit factors were associated with the decline in fair value. 
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded an additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment subsequent to the initial transfer to held for sale totaling   $3 million   and   $108 million  , respectively. Of this amount,   $15 million   and   $145 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, were attributable to fair value adjustments as a result of establishing separate pools for receivables being marketed. Removing these receivables from their risk-based grouping impacts the valuation of the receivables remaining in the risked-based pools. This was partially offset by the impact of settlements on receivables held for sale during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaling   $12 million   and   $37 million  , respectively. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded an additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables held for sale totaling   $83 million   and   $154 million  , respectively, of which   $84 million   and   $137 million   related to changes in fair value during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and   $1 million   and   $17 million   in the year-ago periods, respectively, related to settlements. 
  See Note 4, "Receivables Held for Sale," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. 
  Gain (loss) on sale of real estate secured receivables   increased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The following table summarizes receivables sold by period.  

Differences in the gain (loss) on sale of real estate secured receivables realized between periods reflects both differences in the relative size of the receivable pools sold in each period as well as differences in the composition of the receivable pools sold. The large gain realized on the sale of real estate secured receivables during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was driven by the composition of the receivables sold during the second quarter of 2016 which were primarily less than 30 days contractually delinquent. 
  Other income   decreased during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 as the year-ago periods included a large release in the provision for estimated repurchase liabilities as

discussed more fully below. Excluding the impact of changes in the provision for estimated repurchase liabilities from all periods, other income was essentially flat during the current year periods.  
  Our reserve for potential repurchase liability represents our best estimate of the loss that has been incurred resulting from various representations and warranties in the contractual provisions of our receivable sales. Because the level of receivable repurchase losses are dependent upon strategies for bringing claims or pursuing legal action for losses incurred, the level of the liability for receivables repurchase losses requires significant judgment. As such, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates making it reasonably possible that they could change. During the third quarter of 2015, management concluded that, due to new developments in case law and other factors, it was appropriate to release the repurchase reserve liability related to receivables sold by Decision One Mortgage Company LLC prior to the third quarter of 2007. The following table summarizes the changes in our reserve for potential repurchase liability related to our receivable sales: 

Operating Expenses    The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses. The cost trends in the table below include fixed allocated costs which will not necessarily decline in line with the run-off of our receivable portfolio in future periods. 

Salaries and employee benefits   in all periods was impacted by severance costs resulting from changes in our receivable sales program in September 2016 and June 2015, respectively. Severance costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $21 million in both periods compared with $11 million and $33 million, respectively, in the year-ago periods. Excluding the impact of severance costs from all periods, salaries and employee benefits decreased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to the impact of the continuing reduced scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs.  
  Occupancy and equipment expenses, net   decreased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflecting lower depreciation expense as a result of the sale of a data center during the third quarter of 2015 as discussed above as well as lower repair and utility costs. 
  
   55 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

Real estate owned expenses   decreased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   driven by fewer average numbers of REO properties held during the first nine months of 2016. 
  Support services from HSBC affiliates   decreased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with the year-ago period primarily due to lower technology costs from an HSBC affiliate. To a lesser extent, the decrease also reflects lower fees for receivable servicing by HSBC affiliates as a result of the sale of receivables since September 30, 2015 as well as the impact of terminating a guarantee during the third quarter of 2015 related to a surety bond. 
  Provision for securities litigation liability   As discussed more fully in Note 13, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in June 2016, we agreed to pay   $1,575 million   to settle all claims of the outstanding securities litigation. As a result, we recorded a provision for securities litigation liability of   $575 million   during the second quarter of 2016. During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a provision for securities litigation liability of $350 million. 
  Other expenses   decreased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflecting lower litigation costs and lower legal fees as well as the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in file review costs during the current year periods.  
  Income taxes    The following table provides an analysis of the difference between effective rates based on the total income tax provision attributable to pretax income and the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate: 

(1)   
    The amounts for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were impacted by $8 million and $15 million adjustments, respectively, related primarily to the Federal audit of the 2013 tax year. Additionally, the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was also impacted by a reversal of approximately   $15 million   associated with an out of period adjustment to our deferred tax asset balance. 
               (2)   
    For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the amounts reflect an increase in valuation allowance reserves on certain state net operating loss carryforwards. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the amounts reflect the release of valuation allowance reserves on previously unrecognized state net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences. 
               (3)   
    For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the amounts primarily relate to the resolution of an uncertain items during the third quarter of 2016 primarily related to the Federal Audit of the 2013 tax year. Additionally, the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , also reflects the conclusion of certain State audits. 
     
   56 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

(4)   
    For the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015, the amount mainly relates to the effects of revaluing our deferred tax assets for New York City Tax Reform that was enacted on April 13, 2015. 
     In April 2016, the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released proposed regulations intended to discourage corporate inversions by re-characterizing certain inter-company debt as equity, effectively eliminating the tax deduction for interest paid to related parties under certain circumstances. Final and temporary regulations were released in October 2016 that exempt regulated financial groups such as HSBC and its affiliates from those re-characterization rules. Certain documentation rules included in the regulations will apply to HSBC and its affiliates, and we will analyze the requirements in order to implement the regulations on a timely basis in accordance with the rules. We do not anticipate a significant financial accounting impact upon implementation of the regulations. 

Segment Results   Group Reporting Basis 

We have   one   reportable segment: Consumer. Our Consumer segment consists of our run-off Consumer Lending and Mortgage Services businesses. While these businesses are operating in run-off, they do not qualify to be reported as discontinued operations. Our segment results are reported on a continuing operations basis. There have been no changes in measurement or composition of our segment reporting as compared with the presentation in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  We report financial information to our parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which applies IFRSs as issued by the IASB and as endorsed by the EU, and, as a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources such as employees are primarily made on this basis. However, we continue to monitor liquidity, capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis. The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 18, "Business Segments," and under the caption, "Basis of Reporting" in the MD A section of our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  We continue to review the financial information used to manage our businesses, including the scope and content of the U.S. GAAP financial data being reported to our Management and our Board. To the extent we make changes to this reporting, we will evaluate any impact such changes may have on our segment reporting.

Consumer Segment    The following table summarizes the Group Reporting Basis results for our Consumer segment for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. 

*   Not meaningful 
  Our Consumer segment reported a higher loss before income tax during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with the year ago periods. The loss before income tax during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflects lower net interest income, higher other operating losses, higher loan impairment charges and in the year-to-date period, higher operating expenses. Loan impairment charges for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   include a loan impairment adjustment of approximately   $100 million   representing the cumulative impact of the correction of an error as discussed more fully below.  
  Net interest income decreased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to the following:  
             
    Average loan levels decreased as a result of loan liquidation, including receivable sales. 
                
    During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , overall yields on total average interest earning assets decreased as a result of lower loan yields as discussed more fully below, partially offset by a shift in the mix of total average interest earning assets to a lower percentage of short-term investments which have significantly lower yields than our loan portfolio. During  
     
   58 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , overall yields on total average interest earning assets increased due to the shift in the mix of total average interest earning assets to a lower percentage of short-term investments as discussed above, partially offset by the impact of lower loan yields. The lower loan yields in both periods reflect less favorable changes in yield assumptions on receivables participating in payment incentive programs and the impact of lower amortization of discount due to loan sales and liquidation, partially offset by improvements in the timing of estimated cash flows to be received and the impact of lower levels of impaired loans.  
             
    Interest expense decreased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as a result of lower average borrowings, partially offset by the impact of higher average rates during the year-to-date period due to the maturing of certain lower rate long-term borrowings since September 30, 2015 as well as an increase in rates on certain variable rate debt during the first quarter of 2016. 
     Net interest margin decreased during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , reflecting a lower overall yield on average interest earning assets due to lower loan yields as discussed above while the cost of funds as a percentage of average interest earning assets was essentially flat during the quarter. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net interest margin was essentially flat as the impact of lower loan yields and a higher cost of funds as a percentage of average interest earning assets was largely offset by the shift in mix of total average interest earning assets during the year-to-date period to a lower percentage of short-term investments as discussed above. 
  The following table summarizes significant components of other operating loss for the periods presented: 

(1)   
    Trading loss primarily reflects activity on our portfolio of non-qualifying hedges. 
     The components of other operating loss are discussed below: 
             
    Trading gain (loss)   improved during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as result of terminating our portfolio of non-qualifying hedges during the second quarter of 2016. As a result, trading gain (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and for future periods only reflects ineffectiveness for derivatives that are qualifying hedges. Trading losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 reflects the impact of falling rates prior to the termination of the non-qualifying hedges during the second quarter of 2016. 
                
    Gain (loss) from debt designated at fair value   deteriorated during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflecting an overall tightening of our credit spreads as well as the impact of changes in market movements on certain debt and related derivatives that mature in the near term. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the gain (loss) from debt designated at fair value was impacted by a widening of our credit spreads, which during the three months ended September 30, 2015 was more than offset by the impact of changes in market movements on certain debt and related derivatives that mature in the near term.  
                
    Loss on sale of real estate secured loans   increased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The following table summarizes loans sold by period. 
     
   59 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

Differences in the gain (loss) on sale of real estate secured loans realized between periods reflects both differences in the relative size of the loan pools sold in each period as well as differences in the composition of the loan pools sold. 
             
    Decrease in repurchase reserve liability   reflects our best estimate of the loss that has been incurred resulting from various representations and warranties in the contractual provisions of all our loan sales. During the third quarter of 2015, management concluded that, due to new developments in case law and other factors, it was appropriate to release the repurchase reserve liability related to loans sold by Decision One Mortgage Company LLC prior to the third quarter of 2007. 
                
    Other   reflects lower rental income as a result of the sale of a data center located in Vernon Hills, Illinois to HTSU during the third quarter of 2015 as well as a lower yield adjustment on loans purchased in 2006. 
     During the first quarter of 2016, management identified a calculation error in the loan impairment allowance model for the segment collectively evaluated for impairment. The cumulative impact of this item was an understatement of the loan impairment allowance at March 31, 2016. As a result, loan impairment charges during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   include an adjustment of approximately   $100 million   representing the cumulative impact of the correction of this error under the Group Reporting Basis of accounting and reporting policies. Loan impairment allowances under U.S. GAAP were unaffected. Loan impairment charges for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were also impacted by an out of period adjustment which decreased net charge-offs by   $16 million   in order to properly reflect charge-offs for loans which received a partial forgiveness of principal as a result of an account modification in prior periods. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, loan impairment charges were impacted by a release of approximately $23 million associated with a correction to our credit loss reserve calculation for a segment of our portfolio. 
  Excluding the items discussed above, loan impairment charges increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with the prior year quarter. Loan impairment charges during both the current and prior year quarters were positively impacted by lower loss estimates due to lower loan levels and the impact of lower dollars of delinquency on accounts less than 180 days delinquent. However, the impact was more pronounced during the prior year quarter resulting in higher loan impairment charges during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in the current year quarter was partially offset by lower charge-offs due to lower loan levels. Excluding the items discussed above, loan impairment charges decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with the prior year-to-date period due to lower charge-offs as discussed above as well as a lower impact from discounting the underlying collateral value estimated to be received in the event of loan default. Loan impairment charges during both the current and prior year-to-date were positively impacted by lower loss estimates due to lower loan levels and lower dollars of delinquency, although the impact was more pronounced in the year-ago period as discussed above. 
  Loan impairment charges were $19 million and $13 million lower than net charge-offs during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with loan impairment charges that were lower than net charge-offs by $94 million and $305 million during the year-ago periods. Loan impairment allowances decreased to $450 million at   September 30, 2016   compared with $958 million at   December 31, 2015   primarily as a result of transfers of real estate secured loans to held for sale. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , loans transferred to held for sale had loan impairment allowances totaling $70 million and $471 million, respectively, at the time of transfer. Loans held for sale and the associated loan impairment allowances are reported as a component of other assets. However, these loans continue to be accounted for and impairment continues to be measured through loan impairment charges in accordance with IAS 39, "Financial Instruments: recognition and Measurement," with any gain or loss recorded at the time of sale. The decrease during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   in loan impairment allowances also reflects lower levels of new impaired loans due to lower loan levels, improved economic conditions and lower delinquency levels. The decrease in loan impairment allowances during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was partially offset by the loan impairment adjustment of approximately   $100 million   as discussed above. 
  Operating expenses decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and increased during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include securities litigation expense of $587 million (including $12 million of legal expense) as previously discussed compared with securities litigation expense of $350 million in the prior year-to-date period. Additionally, the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes accruals,  
  
   60 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

primarily related to severance, file review and lease costs of $40 million in both periods compared with severance costs of $11 million and $33 million, respectively, in the year-ago periods resulting from changes in our receivable sales program in June 2015 and September 2016 as previously discussed. Excluding the impact of these items, operating expenses in both the current year periods were lower reflecting lower litigation costs and lower legal fees as well as the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs, partially offset by an increase in file review costs during the current year periods.  
  Real estate secured loans      Real estate secured loans for our Consumer segment consisted of the following: 

*   Not meaningful 
            (1)   
    Represents loans which met the Group Reporting Basis criteria to be classified as held for sale for the periods presented, prior to consideration of any existing loan impairment allowances. 
     Real estate secured loans decreased to   $10,531 million   at   September 30, 2016   as compared with $11,861 million at June 30, 2016 and $18,518 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease reflects the transfer of loans to held for sale during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   with a carrying value of $972 million and $7,064 million, respectively. The decrease also reflects the continued liquidation of this portfolio which will continue going forward. The liquidation rates in our loan portfolio continue to be impacted by declines in loan prepayments as fewer refinancing opportunities for our customers exist.  
  Real estate secured loans which met the Group Reporting Basis criteria to be classified as held for sale had a carrying value of   $949 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared with $917 million at June 30, 2016. At December 31, 2015, there were no real estate secured loans which met the Group Reporting Basis criteria to be classified as held for sale.  
  In October 2016, we sold a pool of loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of   $892 million   (carrying value of $949 million) at the time of sale to a third-party investor for aggregate cash consideration of   $761 million  . We anticipate recording a loss on this transaction in the fourth quarter of 2016 of approximately $125 million.  
  As previously discussed, as a result of a decision in September 2016 to further accelerate our run-off strategy, we intend to sell all of our real estate secured loans, although only a portion of these loans currently qualify for classification as held for sale under the Group Reporting Basis at   September 30, 2016  . Assuming we had completed the sale of our entire portfolio of real estate secured loans on   September 30, 2016  , based on market values at that time, we would have recorded a loss of approximately $1,020 million.

Credit Quality 

Credit Loss Reserves    As previously discussed, in September 2016 we transferred all remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale. As a result, our entire receivable portfolio is now classified as held for sale which is carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and no longer has any associated credit loss reserves. 
  Prior to September 2016, we maintained credit loss reserves to cover probable incurred losses of principal, interest and fees. Credit loss reserves were based on a range of estimates and were intended to be adequate but not excessive. For receivables which were identified as TDR Loans, credit loss reserves were maintained based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' original effective interest rates. We estimated probable losses for receivables which did not qualify as TDR Loans using a roll rate migration analysis that estimated the likelihood that a receivable would progress through the various stages of delinquency, or buckets, and ultimately charge-off based upon recent historical performance experience of other receivables in our portfolio. This migration analysis incorporated estimates of the period of time between a loss occurring and the confirming event of its charge-off. Receivables with different risk characteristics were typically segregated into separate models and utilized different periods of time for estimating the period of a loss occurring and its confirmation. This analysis also considered delinquency status, loss experience and severity and took into account whether borrowers had filed for bankruptcy, receivables had been re-aged or were subject to modification. Our credit loss reserves also took into consideration the loss severity expected based on the underlying collateral, if any, for the receivable in the event of default based on historical and recent trends, which were updated monthly based on a rolling average of several months' data using the most recently available information. Delinquency status may have been affected by customer account management policies and practices, such as the re-age of accounts or modification arrangements. When customer account management policies or changes thereto shifted receivables that did not qualify as a TDR Loan from a  higher  delinquency bucket to a  lower  delinquency bucket, this was reflected in our roll rate statistics. To the extent that re-aged accounts that did not qualify as a TDR Loan had a greater propensity to roll to higher delinquency buckets, this was captured in the roll rates. Since the loss reserve was computed based on the composite of all of these calculations, this increase in roll rate would be applied to receivables in all respective delinquency buckets, which increased the overall reserve level. In addition, loss reserves on receivables were maintained to reflect our judgment of portfolio risk factors that may not have been fully reflected in the statistical roll rate calculation or when historical trends were not reflective of current inherent losses in the portfolio. Portfolio risk factors considered in establishing loss reserves on receivables included product mix, unemployment rates, the credit performance of modified receivables, loan product features such as adjustable rate loans, the credit performance of second lien receivables where the first lien receivable that we own or service were 90 or more days contractually delinquent, economic conditions, such as national and local trends in housing markets and interest rates, portfolio seasoning, account management policies and practices, changes in laws and regulations and other factors which could affect consumer payment patterns on outstanding receivables, such as natural disasters. 
  In setting our credit loss reserves, we specifically considered the credit quality and other risk factors for each of our products. We recognized the different inherent loss characteristics in each of our products as well as customer account management policies and practices and risk management/collection practices. We also considered key ratios, including reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables and reserves as a percentage of receivables. Loss reserve estimates were reviewed periodically and adjustments were reported in earnings when they become known. As these estimates were influenced by factors outside our control, such as consumer payment patterns and economic conditions, there was uncertainty inherent in these estimates, making it likely that they would change. 
  Real estate secured receivable carrying amounts in excess of fair value less cost to sell were generally charged-off no later than the end of the month in which the account became six months contractually delinquent. Values were determined based upon broker price opinions or appraisals which were generally updated at least every 180 days. During the quarterly period between updates, real estate price trends were reviewed on a geographic basis and additional adjustments were recorded as necessary. Typically, receivables written down to fair value of the collateral less cost to sell did not require credit loss reserves.  
  In response to the financial crisis, lenders have significantly tightened underwriting standards, substantially limiting the availability of alternative and subprime mortgages. As fewer financing options currently exist in the marketplace for home buyers, properties in certain markets are remaining on the market for longer periods of time which contributes to home price depreciation. For many of our customers, the ability to refinance and access equity in their homes is no longer an option. These industry trends continue to impact our portfolio and we considered these factors in establishing our credit loss reserve levels, as appropriate. 
  The table below sets forth credit loss reserves and credit loss reserve ratios for the historical periods indicated. The transfer to held for sale of the remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment in September 2016 has resulted in our entire receivable portfolio being carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and no longer have any associated credit loss reserves. Transfers of receivables to held for sale impacts comparability between credit loss reserves and the related reserve ratios between periods.

    At June 30, 2016 and   December 31, 2015  , credit loss reserves includes $10 million and $12 million, respectively, related to receivables held for investment which had been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell primarily reflecting an estimate of additional loss following an interior appraisal of the property.  
               (2)   
    Reserves associated with accrued finance charges, which totaled $47 million and $51 million at June 30, 2016 and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are reported within our total credit loss reserve balances noted above, although receivables and nonaccrual receivables as reported generally exclude accrued finance charges. The credit loss reserve ratios presented in the tables above exclude any reserves associated with accrued finance charges. 
               (3)   
    Credit loss reserve ratios exclude receivables and nonaccrual receivables associated with receivable portfolios which are considered held for sale as these receivables are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value with no corresponding credit loss reserves. 
      See Note 3, "Credit Loss Reserves," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of credit loss reserves by product for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
  Delinquency    Our policies and practices for the collection of receivables, including our customer account management policies and practices, permit us to modify the terms of receivables, either temporarily or permanently (a  modification ), and/or to reset the contractual delinquency status of an account that is contractually delinquent to current (a  re-age ), based on indicators or criteria which, in our judgment, evidence continued payment probability. Such policies and practices differ by product and are designed to manage customer relationships, improve collection opportunities and avoid foreclosure or repossession as determined to be appropriate. If a re-aged account subsequently experiences payment defaults, it will again become contractually delinquent and be included in our delinquency ratios. 
  The table below summarizes dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency for receivables and receivables held for sale and two-months-and-over contractual delinquency as a percent of receivables and receivables held for sale ( delinquency ratio ). As previously discussed, in September 2016 we transferred all of the remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale which must be considered in comparing dollars of contractual delinquency and the delinquency ratio between the periods presented.

    The receivables held for investment balances included in this table reflect the principal amount outstanding on the receivable net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies but exclude any basis adjustments to the receivable such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated receivables, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and premiums or discounts on purchased receivables. Additionally, the balances in this table related to receivables held for sale have been reduced by the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded as well as the credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to the transfer. 
               (2)   
    Two-months-and-over contractually delinquent receivables are classified as "late stage delinquency" if at any point in its life cycle it has been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies (generally 180 days past due). However, as a result of account management actions or other account activity, these receivables may no longer be greater than 180 days past due. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amounts above include $19 million and $23 million, respectively, of receivables that at some point in their life cycle were written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies, but are currently between 60 and 180 days past due.  
                (4)   
    This amount represents delinquent receivables which have been classified as TDR Loans and carried at amortized cost and which at no point in its life cycle have ever been greater than 180 days contractually delinquent. For TDR Loans we evaluate reserves using a discounted cash flow methodology. Each receivable is individually identified as a TDR Loan and then grouped together with other TDR Loans with similar characteristics. The discounted cash flow impairment analysis is then applied to these groups of TDR Loans. This amount excludes TDR Loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies as they are reflected in the late stage delinquency totals. 
               (5)   
    This amount represents delinquent receivables which at no point in its life cycle have ever been greater than 180 days contractually delinquent and are not classified as TDR Loans. As discussed more fully above, for these receivables we establish credit loss reserves using a roll rate migration analysis that estimates the likelihood that a receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off based upon recent historical performance experience of other receivables in our portfolio. 
      Dollars of delinquency and delinquency ratio for real estate secured receivables held for investment   At September 30, 2016, there were no dollars of delinquency or delinquency ratio for receivables held for investment as all receivables are classified as held for sale.  
  Dollars of delinquency for receivables held for sale   at September 30, 2016 decreased as compared with June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 as a result of receivables sold during the third quarter of 2016 and improvements in credit quality, partially offset by the transfer to held for sale of all receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio.  
  Delinquency ratio for receivables held for sale   The delinquency ratio for receivables held for sale was   5.37 percent   at September 30, 2016 compared with   14.83 percent   at June 30, 2016 and   6.88 percent   at December 31, 2015. The transfer to held for sale of all receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio has impacted the comparability of the delinquency ratio for receivables held for sale between periods. The delinquency ratio was unusually high at June 30, 2016 as a result of receivable sales in the second quarter of 2016 which resulted in a significant decrease in the level of receivables held for sale while dollars of delinquency for receivables held for sale at June 30, 2016 were not impacted by the sale as the receivables sold were primarily less than 30 days contractually delinquent. 
  See  Customer Account Management Policies and Practices  regarding the delinquency treatment of re-aged and modified accounts. 
  Net Charge-offs    The following table summarizes net charge-off of receivables both in dollars and as a percent of average receivables ( net charge-off ratio ). During a quarter in which receivables are transferred to receivables held for sale, those receivables continue to be included in the average receivable balances prior to such transfer and any charge-off related to those receivables prior to such transfer, including the recognition of existing credit loss reserves at the time of transfer and the credit portion of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment, if any, remain in our net charge-off totals. However, in the quarter following the transfer to held for sale classification, the receivables are no longer included in average receivables as such receivables are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and, accordingly, there are no further charge-offs associated with these receivables. As a result, the amounts and ratios presented below are not comparable between periods.

    The net charge-off ratio for all quarterly periods is net charge-offs for the quarter, annualized, as a percentage of average receivables for the quarter.

Net real estate secured receivable charge-offs dollars for all periods were impacted by the transfer of additional receivables to held for sale, although the impact was more pronounced during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the decision in September 2016 to transfer to held for sale all of the remaining receivables classified as held for investment. Credit loss reserves existing at the time of transfer are recorded as additional charge-off upon transfer and totaled   $244 million  ,   $4 million   and $24 million, during the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Additionally, the credit portion of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded at the time of transfer to receivables held for sale was recorded as additional charge-off and totaled   $557 million  ,   $6 million   and $12 million during the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Net charge-off dollars for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016 also includes an out of period adjustment which decreased net charge-offs by   $12 million   in order to properly reflect charge-offs for receivables which received a partial forgiveness of principal as a result of an account modification. 
  Excluding the impact to net charge-off dollars related of the items discussed above, net charge-offs dollars remained lower as compared with the prior quarter and prior year quarter reflecting lower levels of receivables held for investment and lower charge-off on accounts that reach 180 days contractual delinquency reflecting improved credit quality as a result of improvements in economic conditions and home prices since September 30, 2015. As a result of transferring all of the remaining receivables held for investment to held for sale in September 2016, no additional charge-offs will be recorded in future periods. 
  The net real estate secured receivable charge-off ratio for the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016   increased as compared with the prior quarter and prior year quarter due to higher dollars of net charge-offs driven by the transfer of additional receivables to held for sale as discussed above and the impact of lower average receivable levels.  
  Real estate charge-offs and REO expenses as a percentage of average real estate secured receivables for the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016   increased as compared with the prior quarter and prior year quarter due to higher dollars of net charge-offs as discussed above and the impact of lower average receivable levels, partially offset by lower REO expenses during the current year periods. See  Results of Operations  for further discussion of REO expense. 
  Nonperforming Assets    As previously discussed, during the third quarter of 2016 we transferred to held for sale all remaining receivables classified as held for investment which must be considered in comparing nonperforming assets between periods. Nonperforming assets consisted of the following for the periods presented: 

(1)   
    The receivable balances included in this table reflect the principal amount outstanding on the receivable net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies but exclude any basis adjustments to the receivable such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated receivables, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and premiums or discounts on purchased receivables. Additionally, the balances in this table related to receivables which have been classified as held for sale have been reduced by the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded as well as the credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to the transfer. Nonaccrual receivables reflect all receivables which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as second lien receivables (regardless of delinquency status) where the first lien receivable that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. Nonaccrual receivables held for investment and held for sale do not include receivables totaling $424 million, $452 million and   $501 million   at   September 30, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which are less than 90 days contractually delinquent and not accruing interest. In addition, nonaccrual receivables do not include receivables which have made qualifying payments and have been re-aged and the contractual delinquency status reset to current as such activity, in our judgment, evidences continued payment probability. If a re-aged receivable subsequently experiences payment default and becomes 90 or more days contractually delinquent, it will be reported as nonaccrual.  
               (2)   
    Nonaccrual receivables are classified as "late stage delinquency" if at any point in its life cycle it has been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies (generally 180 days past due). However, as a result of account management actions or other account activity, these receivables may no longer be greater than 180 days past due. At June 30, 2016 and   December 31, 2015  , the amounts above include $10 million and $15 million, respectively, of receivables that at some point in their life cycle were evaluated for write-down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies, but are currently between 90 and 180 days past due.

    This amount represents nonaccrual receivables which have been classified as TDR Loans and carried at amortized cost and which at no point in its life cycle have ever been greater than 180 days contractually delinquent. This amount represents TDR Loans for which we evaluate reserves using a discounted cash flow methodology. Each receivable is individually identified as a TDR Loan and then grouped together with other TDR Loans with similar characteristics. The discounted cash flow impairment analysis is then applied to these groups of TDR Loans. This amount excludes TDR Loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell as they are reflected in the late stage delinquency totals. 
               (5)   
    This amount represents nonaccrual receivables which at no point in its life cycle have ever been greater than 180 days contractually delinquent and are not classified as TDR Loans. As discussed more fully above, for these receivables we establish credit loss reserves using a roll rate migration analysis that estimates the likelihood that a receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off based upon recent historical performance experience of other receivables in our portfolio. 
       Nonaccrual real estate secured receivables held for investment   At September 30, 2016, there were no nonaccrual receivables held for investment as all receivables are classified as held for sale.  
  Nonaccrual receivables held for sale   at September 30, 2016 decreased as compared with June 30, 2016 as a result of receivables sold during the third quarter of 2016 and improvements in credit quality, partially offset by the transfer to held for sale of all receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio. The increase as compared with     December 31, 2015 reflects the transfer to held for sale of all receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio, partially offset by the impact of improvements in credit quality and the sale of loans in the third quarter of 2016. 
  At September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, nonaccrual receivables and receivables held for sale in the table above include TDR Loans totaling $299 million, $459 million and $463 million, respectively, some of which at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are carried at the lower of amortized cost of the fair value of the collateral less cost sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies. See Note 2, "Receivables Held for Investment, net," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details regarding TDR Loan balances.  
  Customer Account Management Policies and Practices    Our policies and practices for the collection of consumer receivables, including our customer account management policies and practices, permit us to take action with respect to delinquent or troubled accounts based on criteria which, in our judgment, evidence continued payment probability, as well as a continuing desire for borrowers to stay in their homes. The policies and practices are designed to manage customer relationships, improve collection opportunities and avoid foreclosure as determined to be appropriate. From time to time we re-evaluate these policies and procedures and make changes as deemed appropriate. 
  Currently, we utilize the following account management actions: 
             
    Modification     Management action that results in a change to the terms and conditions of the receivable either temporarily or permanently without changing the delinquency status of the receivable. Modifications may include changes to one or more terms of the receivable including, but not limited to, a change in interest rate, extension of the amortization period, reduction in payment amount and partial forgiveness or deferment of principal. 
                
    Collection Re-age     Management action that results in the resetting of the contractual delinquency status of an account to current but does not involve any changes to the original terms and conditions of the receivable. If an account which has been re-aged subsequently experiences a payment default, it will again become contractually delinquent. We use collection re-aging as an account and customer management tool in an effort to increase the cash flow from our account relationships, and accordingly, the application of this tool is subject to complexities, variations and changes from time to time.  
                
    Modification Re-age     Management action that results in a change to the terms and conditions of the receivable, either temporarily or permanently, and also resets the contractual delinquency status of an account to current as discussed above. If an account which has been re-aged subsequently experiences a payment default, it will again become contractually delinquent. 
     Generally, in our experience, we have found that the earlier in the default cycle we have been able to utilize account management actions, the lower the rate of recidivism. Additionally, we have found that for receivable modification, modifications with significant amounts of payment reduction experience lower levels of recidivism. Some customers receive multiple account management actions. In this regard, multiple account management actions as a percentage of total account management actions are in a range of 72 percent to 76 percent. 
  Our policies and practices for managing accounts are continually reviewed and assessed to assure that they meet the goals outlined above, and accordingly, we make exceptions to these general policies and practices from time to time. In addition, exceptions to these policies and practices may be made in specific situations in response to legal or regulatory agreements or orders.

The following table shows the number of real estate secured accounts remaining in our portfolio (including receivables held for sale) as well as the outstanding receivable balance of these accounts as of the period indicated for receivables for which we have taken an account management action by the type of action taken, some of which may have received multiple account management actions. 

(1)   
    The outstanding receivable balance included in this table reflects the principal amount outstanding on the receivable net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies but excludes any basis adjustments to the receivable such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated receivables, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and premiums or discounts on purchased receivables. Additionally, the balance in this table related to receivables which have been classified as held for sale has been reduced by the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded as well as the credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to the transfer. 
               (2)   
    At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the outstanding receivable balance includes the following amounts related to receivables classified as held for sale. At September 30, 2016, the entire outstanding receivable balance is classified as held for sale.

HSBC Finance Corporation 

The following table provides information regarding the delinquency status of receivables remaining in the portfolio that were granted modifications of loan terms and/or re-aged at September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 in the categories shown above: 

The following table provides information regarding real estate secured modified and/or re-aged receivables during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015: 

(1)   
    Includes collection re-age only, modification only, and modification re-ages. 
               (2)   
    Includes amounts received under a short sale whereby the property is sold by the borrower at a price which has been pre-negotiated with us and the borrower is released from further obligation. 
               (3)   
    Amounts include the credit loss reserves existing at the time of transfer of receivables to held for sale which are recognized as charge-off. Amounts also include the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment attributable to credit factors for receivables transferred to held for sale. See Note 3, "Credit Loss Reserves," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
     In addition to the account management techniques discussed above, we also use deed-in-lieu and short sales to assist our real estate secured receivable customers. In a deed-in-lieu, the borrower agrees to surrender the deed to the property without going through foreclosure proceedings and we release the borrower from further obligation. In a short sale, the property is offered for sale to potential buyers at a price which has been pre-negotiated between us and the borrower. This pre-negotiated price is based on updated property valuations and overall loss exposure given liquidation through foreclosure. Short sales also release the borrower from further obligation. From our perspective, total losses on deed-in-lieu and short sales are lower than expected total losses from foreclosed receivables, or receivables where we have previously decided not to pursue foreclosure, and provide resolution to the  
  
   68 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

delinquent receivable over a shorter period of time. While deed-in-lieu and short sales were used more extensively in prior years, during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   we have used fewer of these account management techniques as compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 as many of the receivables which in the past would have been resolved through a deed-in-lieu or short-sale have been sold as part of our receivable sale program. 
  Modification programs    We actively use account modifications to reduce the rate and/or payment on a number of qualifying loans and generally re-age certain of these accounts upon receipt of two or more modified payments and other criteria being met. This account management practice is designed to improve cash collections and avoid foreclosure as determined to be appropriate. A significant portion of our real estate secured receivable portfolio has received multiple modifications.  
  We continually review our policies and practices for managing accounts to leverage industry best practices and to assist us in identifying customers who are willing to pay, but are expected to have longer term disruptions in their ability to pay. In the second half of 2013, we expanded our current modification program to include principal write downs to customers meeting certain criteria. For qualifying customers, we determine the full amount contractually due, including unpaid principal balance, outstanding deferred interest and other ancillary disbursements that, by law, are reimbursable, and reduce the outstanding amount to a lower amount. However, in many cases this principal forgiveness does not change the carrying value of the receivable as many of these receivables had previously been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral in accordance with our existing charge-off policies.  
  During 2014, we revised our modification programs resulting in a minimum modification term of 24 months. As a result, the receivables remaining in our portfolio are comprised of a growing composition of longer dated modifications. 
  As economic conditions, including unemployment, have continued to improve and the level of delinquency has decreased, customer requests for assistance through receivable modification programs has declined in recent years. We expect the volume of new modifications to continue to decrease as a result of the continued seasoning of a liquidating portfolio. 
  We will continue to evaluate our consumer relief programs as well as all aspects of our account management practices to ensure our programs benefit our customers in accordance with their financial needs in ways that are economically viable for both our customers and our stakeholders. Receivables modified under these programs are only included in the re-aging statistics table ( Re-age Table ) that is included in our discussion of our re-age programs if the delinquency status of a receivable was reset as a part of the modification or was re-aged in the past for other reasons. Not all receivables modified under these programs have the delinquency status reset and, therefore, are not considered to have been re-aged. 
  The following table summarizes receivables modified during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, some of which may have also been re-aged: 

(1)   
    Includes all receivables modified during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 regardless of whether the receivable was also re-aged. 
               (2)   
    If qualification criteria are met, receivable modification may occur on more than one occasion for the same account. For purposes of the table above, an account is only included in the modification totals once in an annual period and not for each separate modification in an annual period. 
     A primary tool used during account modification involves modifying the monthly payment through lowering the rate on the receivable on either a temporary or permanent basis. The following table summarizes the weighted-average contractual rate reductions and the average amount of payment relief provided to customers that entered an account modification (including receivables currently classified as held for sale) for the first time during the quarter indicated.  
  
   69 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

(1)   
    The weighted-average rate reduction was determined based on the rate in effect immediately prior to the modification, which may be lower than the rate on the receivable at the time of origination. 
      The weighted-average contractual rate reduction in basis points reflects changes in our program strategy during the fourth quarter of 2015 which limits the amount of payment relief which can be achieved through rate reduction and shifts the additional payment relief to other types of modification, such as term extension, principal deferral or principal-write down.  
  Re-age programs    Our policies and practices include various criteria for an account to qualify for re-aging, but do not, however, require us to re-age the account. The extent to which we re-age accounts that are eligible under our existing policies will differ depending upon our view of prevailing economic conditions and other factors which may change from period to period. In addition, exceptions to our policies and practices may be made in specific situations in response to legal or regulatory agreements or orders. It is our practice to defer past due interest on re-aged accounts to the end of the loan period. We do not accrue interest on past due interest payments as required by our 2002 settlement agreement with the State Attorneys General. 
  We continue to monitor and track information related to accounts that have been re-aged. First lien real estate secured products generally have less loss severity exposure than other products because of the underlying collateral. Credit loss reserves, including reserves on TDR Loans, take into account whether receivables have been re-aged or are subject to modification, extension or deferment. Our credit loss reserves, including reserves on TDR Loans, also take into consideration the expected loss severity based on the underlying collateral for the receivable. TDR Loans are typically reserved for using a discounted cash flow methodology. 
  We used certain assumptions and estimates to compile our re-aging statistics. The systemic counters used to compile the information presented below exclude from the reported statistics receivables that have been reported as contractually delinquent but have been reset to a current status because we have determined that the receivables should not have been considered delinquent (e.g., payment application processing errors). When comparing re-aging statistics from different periods, the fact that our re-age policies and practices will change over time, that exceptions are made to those policies and practices, and that our data capture methodologies have been enhanced, should be taken into account. 
  The following tables provide information about re-aged real estate secured receivables and real estate secured receivables held for sale and includes both Collection Re-ages and Modification Re-ages, as discussed above.  

(1)   
    The receivable balance included in this table reflects the principal amount outstanding on the receivable net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies and includes certain basis adjustments to the receivable such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated receivables, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and premiums or discounts on purchased receivables. Additionally, the balance in this table related to receivables which have been classified as held for sale has been reduced by the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded as well as the credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to the transfer. The receivable balances exclude accrued interest income.

HSBC Finance Corporation 

(2)   
    The tables above exclude any accounts re-aged without receipt of a payment which only occurs under special circumstances, such as re-ages associated with disaster or in connection with a bankruptcy filing. At   September 30, 2016  , June 30, 2016 and   December 31, 2015  , the unpaid principal balance of re-ages without receipt of a payment totaled $120 million, $206 million and $250 million, respectively. 
      At   September 30, 2016  , June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $420 million (10 percent of total re-aged receivables in the Re-Age table), $646 million (13 percent of total re-aged receivables in the Re-Age table) and $737 million (8 percent of total re-aged receivables in the Re-Age Table), respectively, of re-aged accounts have subsequently experienced payment defaults and are included in our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency at the period indicated. 
  We continue to work with advocacy groups in select markets to assist in encouraging our customers with financial needs to contact us. We consider the feedback from advocacy groups as we make changes in our modification programs. We have also implemented training programs to ensure that our customer service representatives are focused on helping the customer through difficulties, are knowledgeable about the available re-aging and modification programs and are able to advise each customer of the best solutions for their individual circumstance. 
  We also support a variety of national and local efforts in homeownership preservation and foreclosure avoidance. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk      A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or having similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. 
  Our receivable portfolio is comprised of loans to non-prime consumers. Such customers are individuals who have limited credit histories, modest incomes, high debt-to-income ratios or have experienced credit problems evidenced by occasional delinquencies, prior charge-offs, bankruptcy or other credit related actions. The majority of our secured receivables have high loan-to-value ratios.  
  Because our lending activities were primarily to individual consumers, we do not have receivables from any industry group that equal or exceed 10 percent of total receivables at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . The following table reflects the percentage of receivables (including receivables held for investment and held for sale) by state which individually account for 5 percent or greater of our portfolio. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

HSBC Related Funding    We work with our affiliates under the oversight of HSBC North America to maximize funding opportunities and efficiencies in HSBC's operations in the United States. All of our ongoing funding requirements have been integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plans and our funding requirements are sourced primarily through HSBC USA Inc. ("HSBC USA") or HSBC North America. 
  Due to affiliates totaled   $4,824 million   and   $5,925 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The interest rates on funding from HSBC subsidiaries are market-based and comparable to those available from unaffiliated parties.  
  In July 2016, we prepaid a   $600 million   loan agreement with HSBC North America which had maturities between 2034 and 2035.

The following table summarizes maturities of amounts due to affiliates at   September 30, 2016  : 

In October 2016, we prepaid a $1,000 million loan agreement with HSBC North America. 
  See Note 9, "Related Party Transactions," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion about our funding arrangements with HSBC affiliates, including derivatives.  
  Short-Term Investments    Securities purchased under agreements to resell totaled   $824 million   and   $2,724 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Short-term investments decreased as compared with   December 31, 2015   reflecting the retirement of debt, payment of the Jaffe settlement and the redemption of the Series B preferred stock, partially offset by cash received from receivable sales and sales of REO properties.  
  Long-Term Debt    (excluding amounts due to affiliates) decreased to   $4,494 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $9,510 million   at   December 31, 2015  . There were no issuances of long-term debt during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or 2015. Repayments of long-term debt totaled   $5,074 million   and   $3,805 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The following table summarizes maturities of long-term debt at   September 30, 2016  , including secured financings: 

In July 2016, we entered into a $3 million, 364- day revolving credit facility agreement with an unaffiliated bank to satisfy mandatory requirements of certain states to maintain a back-up line of credit from an unrelated third party. This credit facility required us to post $3 million in collateral with this third-party bank.   
  Secured financings previously issued under public trusts of   $436 million   at   September 30, 2016   are secured by   $790 million   of closed-end real estate secured receivables which are classified as receivables held for sale at September 30, 2016. Secured financings previously issued under public trusts of   $879 million   at   December 31, 2015   were secured by   $1,654 million   of closed-end real estate secured receivables which are classified as receivables held for investment at December 31, 2015. 
  In order to eliminate future foreign exchange risk, currency swaps were used at the time of issuance of all foreign-denominated notes to fix the notes in U.S. dollars. 
  We use derivatives for managing interest rate and currency risk and have received loan commitments from affiliates, but we do not otherwise enter into off-balance sheet transactions. 
  Preferred Stock    On June 30, 2016, we redeemed all of the outstanding preferred securities of the 6.36 percent Non-cumulative Series B preferred stock for $575 million.  
  Common Equity    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, we did not receive any capital contributions from HINO. However, as we continue to liquidate our receivable portfolios, HSBC's continued support will be required to properly  
  
   72 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

manage our business and maintain appropriate levels of capital. HSBC has historically provided significant capital in support of our operations and has indicated that they remain fully committed and have the capacity to continue that support. 
  Capital ratio    Common and preferred equity to total assets totaled   35.04 percent   at   September 30, 2016   compared with   27.48 percent   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  HSBC North America continues to review the composition of its capital structure following the adoption by the U.S. banking regulators of the final rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital and liquidity reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which were effective as of January 1, 2014. We continue to review the composition of our capital structure and, subject to receipt of regulatory approval, as necessary, we anticipate replacing instruments whose treatment is less favorable under the new rules with Basel III compliant instruments. Any required funding has been integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plans and we expect it to be sourced through HSBC USA, HSBC North America, or through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates.  
  HSBC North America participates in the Federal Reserve Board's ("Federal Reserve") CCAR program and submitted its latest CCAR capital plan and annual company-run stress test results in April 2016. In June 2016, the Federal Reserve informed HSBC North America, our indirect parent company, that it did not object to HSBC North America's capital plan or the planned capital distributions included in its 2016 CCAR submission. Stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of HSBC North America. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity. 
  2016 Funding Strategy    The following table summarizes our current range of estimates for funding needs and sources for 2016:    

(1)   
    Net of receivable charge-offs. 
               (2)   
    The estimated amounts in the table above for the period October 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 reflect the investment in short-term investments of proceeds from receivable sales anticipated to occur during the fourth quarter of 2016.  
     For the remainder of 2016, the combination of cash generated from operations, including balance sheet attrition and receivable sales, will generate the liquidity necessary to meet our maturing debt obligations.  

Fair Value 

Net income volatility arising from changes in either interest rate or credit components of the mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives or changes in the fair value of receivables held for sale, REO or receivables carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell affects the comparability of reported results between periods. Accordingly, our results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period.  
  Fair Value Hierarchy    Accounting principles related to fair value measurements establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the  Fair Value Framework ). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that  
  
   73 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy: 
             
    whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; 
                
    whether the instrument is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price that is readily available; 
                
    the size of transactions occurring in an active market; 
                
    the level of bid-ask spreads; 
                
    a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, market liquidity; 
                
    whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; 
                
    whether the inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and 
                
    whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value. 
     Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for the identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume.  
  Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We generally classify derivative contracts as well as our own debt issuance for which we have elected fair value option which are not traded in active markets, as Level 2 measurements. These valuations are typically obtained from a third party valuation source which, in the case of derivatives, includes valuations provided by an affiliate, HSBC Bank USA, National Association (together with its subsidiaries "HSBC Bank USA"). 
  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis totaling   $9,391 million   (  61 percent   of total assets) and $8,265 million (34 percent of total assets), respectively. The increase at   September 30, 2016   reflects the transfer of all remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale in September 2016. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 
  Classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on whether the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is observable. As such, the classification within the fair value hierarchy is dynamic and can be transferred to other hierarchy levels in each reporting period. Transfers between leveling categories are assessed, determined and recognized at the end of each reporting period.  
  See Note 12,  Fair Value Measurements,  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details including our valuation techniques as well as the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Additionally, see Note 12, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information about transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements and transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 measurements during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.

Risk Management 

Overview    Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. To do so, we employ a risk management framework at all levels and across all risk types. It fosters the continuous monitoring of the risk environment and an integrated evaluation of risks and their interactions. It is designed to ensure that we have a robust and consistent approach to risk management across all of our activities. While we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations, our risk management framework has been designed to provide robust controls and ongoing monitoring of our principal risks. We strive to continuously improve our risk management processes through ongoing employee training and development. 
  The principal risks associated with our operations include the following: 
             
    Credit risk   is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract; 
                
    Liquidity risk   is the potential that an institution will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due because of inadequate cash flow or the inability to liquidate assets or obtain funding itself; 
                
    Market risk   is the risk that movements in market factors, including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios; 
                
    Interest rate risk   is the potential impairment of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses in value due to rate movements; 
                
    Operational risk   is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from external events (including legal risk); 
                
    Compliance risk   is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of all relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice causing us to incur fines, penalties and damage to our business and reputation; 
                
    Reputational risk   is the risk arising from failure to meet stakeholder expectations as a result of any event, behavior, action or inaction, either by us, our employees, the HSBC Group or those with whom we are associated that may cause stakeholders to form a negative view of us. This might also result in financial or non-financial impacts, loss of confidence or other consequences; 
                
    Strategic risk   is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; 
                
    Security and Fraud risk   is the risk to the business from terrorism, crime, fraud, information security, incidents/disasters, cyber-attacks and groups hostile to HSBC interests; 
                
    Model risk   is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. This occurs primarily for two reasons: 1) the model may produce inaccurate outputs when compared to the intended business use and design objective; and 2) the model could be used incorrectly; and  
                
    Pension risk   is the risk that the cash flows associated with pension assets will not be enough to cover the pension benefit obligations required to be paid and includes the risk that assumptions used by our actuaries may differ from actual experience. 
     See "Risk Management" in MD A in our 2015 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices. Our risk management process involves the use of various simulation models. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable, but actual events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. Consequently, model results may be considered reasonable estimates, with the understanding that actual results may vary significantly from model projections.  
  Credit Risk Management    Day-to-day management of credit risk is administered by our Retail Chief Risk Officer with ultimate reporting responsibility to the HSBC North America Chief Risk Officer. The HSBC North America Chief Risk Officer reports to the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer, to the Risk Committee of the HSBC North America Board of Directors and to the HSBC Group Chief Risk Officer. Our credit and portfolio management procedures currently focus on effective collections and customer account management efforts, in addition to supporting disciplined execution of the receivable sales program. Our customer account management policies and practices are described under the caption  Credit Quality - Customer Account Management Policies and Practices  in this MD A. 
  As previously discussed, in September 2016 we transferred to held for sale all remaining receivables classified as held for investment. As a result our entire receivable portfolio is now classified as held for sale which is carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair

value and no longer has any associated credit loss reserves. Prior the transfer in September 2016, we also had specific policies to ensure the establishment of appropriate credit loss reserves on a timely basis to cover probable losses of principal, interest and fees. Additionally Note 2,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,  in our 2015 Form 10-K includes further discussion of the policies surrounding credit loss reserves.  
  Our policies and procedures are consistent with HSBC Group standards and are regularly reviewed and updated both on an HSBC Finance Corporation and HSBC level. The credit risk function continues to refine  early warning  indicators and reporting, including stress testing scenarios on the basis of current experience. These risk management tools are embedded within our business planning process. 
  Counterparty credit risk is our primary exposure on our interest rate swap portfolio. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , all of our existing derivative contracts are with HSBC Bank USA, making them our sole counterparty in derivative transactions. The fair value of our agreements with HSBC Bank USA required us to provide collateral to the affiliate of   $189 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $491 million   at   December 31, 2015  , all of which was provided in cash. See Note 6,  Derivative Financial Instruments,  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our derivative portfolio. 
  There have been no material changes to our approach to credit risk management since December 31, 2015. 
  Liquidity Risk Management    Continued liquidation of our receivable portfolio will be the primary driver of our liquidity management process going forward. However, lower operating cash flow as a result of declining receivable balances may not provide sufficient cash to fully cover maturing debt in future periods. We currently do not expect third-party long-term debt to be a source of funding for us in the future given the run-off nature of our business. Any required incremental funding has been integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plan and we expect it to be sourced through HSBC USA, HSBC North America, or will be obtained through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates. HSBC has indicated it remains fully committed and has the capacity to continue to provide such support. 
  HSBC North America maintains a liquidity management and contingency funding plan, which identifies certain potential early indicators of liquidity problems, and actions that can be taken both initially and in the event of a liquidity crisis, to minimize the long-term impact on our businesses. The liquidity contingency funding plan is reviewed annually and approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. We recognize a liquidity crisis can either be specific to us, relating to our ability to meet our obligations in a timely manner, or market-wide, caused by a macro risk event in the broader financial system. A range of indicators is monitored to attain an early warning of any liquidity issues. These include widening of key spreads or indices used to track market volatility, widening of our credit spreads and higher borrowing costs. In the event of a cash flow crisis, our objective is to fund cash requirements without HSBC affiliate access to the wholesale unsecured funding market for at least 90 days. Contingency funding needs will be satisfied primarily through liquidation of short term investments, sale of receivables or secured borrowing using the mortgage portfolio as collateral. We maintain a liquid asset buffer consisting of cash and short-term liquid assets. 
  Prior to 2016, we employed stressed coverage ratios to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. Stressed coverage ratios, incorporating HSBC-specific stress scenarios, were used to monitor the resilience to severe liquidity stresses. Beginning in 2016, HSBC replaced these stressed coverage ratios with the Basel Committee based Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") as discussed further below. As a result, we now employ this ratio as part of our approach to liquidity risk management. There have been no other material changes to our approach towards liquidity risk management since December 31, 2015. See  Risk Management  in MD A in our 2015 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to liquidity risk.  
  The Basel Committee based LCR is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days. Under European Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/61, the Basel Committee based LCR became a minimum regulatory standard beginning in 2015. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our LCR ratio under the EU LCR rule was 47,636 percent and 499 percent, respectively. A LCR ratio of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The significant increase in the LCR ratio at September 30, 2016 reflects a significant decrease in contractual net cash outflows as of September 30, 2016 which fluctuates between reporting periods. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets. 
  HSBC North America has adjusted its liquidity profile to support compliance with these rules. HSBC North America may need to make further changes to its liquidity profile to support compliance with any future final rules. HSBC Finance Corporation may need to adjust its liquidity profile to support HSBC North America's compliance with these rules, but it is not anticipated to significantly impact our operations.

In November 2015, the Financial Stability Board issued its final standards for Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity ( TLAC ) requirements for global systemically important banks ("G-SIBs"), In October 2015, the Federal Reserve issued its proposal to impose TLAC requirements on U.S. G-SIBs and the U.S. intermediate holding companies ("IHCs") owned by non-U.S. G-SIBs ("TLAC Proposal"). The TLAC Proposal represents an extension of the current regulatory capital framework, which is aimed at ensuring that a banking organization can absorb losses without falling into resolution. The TLAC Proposal would require the U.S. IHCs of G-SIBs ("Covered IHCs"), including HSBC North America, to maintain minimum amounts of internal TLAC, which would include minimum levels of TLAC and long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria, and a related TLAC buffer commencing January 1, 2019. Additionally, the TLAC Proposal would include "clean holding company" requirements that impose stringent limitations on the ability of Covered IHCs to incur common types of non-TLAC-related liabilities. The Federal Reserve requested comments on all aspects of the proposal by February 19, 2016. We provided a comment letter to the Federal Reserve in February and a supplementary letter in June.  
  As indicated by the major rating agencies, our credit ratings are directly dependent upon the continued support of HSBC. A credit rating downgrade would increase future borrowing costs only for new debt obligations, if any. As discussed above, we do not currently expect to need to raise funds from the issuance of third party debt going forward, but instead any required funding has been integrated into HSBC North America's funding plans and we expect it to be sourced through HSBC USA, HSBC North America or through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates. HSBC has historically provided significant capital in support of our operations and has indicated that they remain fully committed and have the capacity to continue that support. 
  The following table summarizes our credit ratings at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and litigation matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions.  
  In March 2016, Moody's changed the rating outlook for HSBC Finance Corporation to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for HSBC. The outlook change for HSBC signifies Moody's concerns about a weakening in intrinsic financial strength due to deteriorating operating conditions in Hong Kong, one of HSBC's key markets. In spite of their concerns, Moody's stated that HSBC's willingness to provide support to its U.S. subsidiaries remains very high. While the outlook changed, Moody's affirmed its ratings for HSBC Finance Corporation.  
  In July 2016, Standard   Poor's Corporation ("S P') took various rating agency actions on U.K. banks, including HSBC, to reflect rising economic risks for the U.K. domestic banking industry, including potential pressures arising from the U.K. vote to leave the European Union. As a result, S P changed the rating outlook for HSBC Finance Corporation to negative from stable. While the outlook changed, S P affirmed its ratings for HSBC Finance Corporation. 
  Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At   September 30, 2016  , there were no pending actions from these rating agencies in terms of changes to the ratings presented in the table above for HSBC Finance Corporation. 
  Other conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include unforeseen capital requirements, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar which would require us to post additional collateral for our cross currency swaps, a slowdown in the rate of attrition of our balance sheet and an inability to obtain expected funding from HSBC and its subsidiaries. 
  See  Liquidity and Capital Resources  for further discussion of our liquidity position. 
  There have been no material changes to our approach to liquidity risk management since December 31, 2015. 
  Market Risk Management    We maintain an overall risk management strategy that primarily uses standard, over-the-counter interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the use of interest rate swaps.  
  We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of currency swaps. Our financial statements are affected by movements in exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated debt. 
  There have been no material changes to our approach to market risk management since December 31, 2015.

Interest Rate Risk Management    A principal part of our management of interest rate risk is to monitor the sensitivity of projected net interest income under varying interest rate scenarios (simulation modeling). We aim, through our management of interest rate risk, to mitigate the effect of prospective interest rate movements which could reduce future net interest income, while weighing the cost of such hedging activities on the current net revenue stream. 
  Net interest income simulation modeling techniques are utilized to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income. These techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various rate shock scenarios, such as scenarios in which rates rise or fall by 100 basis points over a twelve month period as well as the impact of an immediate 50 basis point decrease in the yield curve. The following table reflects the impact on projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques:

As compared with   December 31, 2015  , the estimated increase in projected net interest income following a hypothetical rate rise and the estimated decrease in projected net interest income following a hypothetical rate reduction reflects updates of economic stress scenarios including housing price index assumptions, regular adjustments of asset and liability behavior assumptions, run-off of the balance sheet and model enhancements. 
  A principal consideration underlying the projected net interest income at risk analysis is the projected prepayment of receivable balances for a given economic scenario. Individual loan underwriting standards in combination with housing valuations, receivable modification programs, changes to our foreclosure processes and macroeconomic factors related to available mortgage credit are the key assumptions driving these prepayment projections. While we have utilized a number of sources to refine these projections, we cannot currently project precise prepayment rates with a high degree of certainty in all economic environments given post crisis, significant changes in both subprime mortgage underwriting standards and property valuations across the country. 
  The projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts.

PART II 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings. 

See Note 13,  Litigation and Regulatory Matters,  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our legal proceedings disclosure, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 5.    Other Information. 

Disclosures pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act      Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act requires each issuer registered with the SEC to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports whether it or any of its affiliates have knowingly engaged in specified activities or transactions with persons or entities targeted by U.S. sanctions programs relating to Iran, terrorism, or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, even if those activities are not prohibited by U.S. law and are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with local laws and regulations. 
  To comply with this requirement, HSBC has requested relevant information from its affiliates globally. During the period covered by this Form 10-Q, HSBC Finance Corporation did not engage in any activities or transactions requiring disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r). The following activities conducted by our affiliates are disclosed in response to Section 13(r):  
  Loans in repayment    Between 2001 and 2005, the Project and Export Finance division of the HSBC Group arranged or participated in a portfolio of loans to Iranian energy companies and banks. All of these loans were guaranteed by European and Asian export credit agencies and have varied maturity dates with final maturity in 2018. For those loans that remain outstanding, the HSBC Group continues to seek repayment in accordance with its obligations to the supporting export credit agencies. Details of these loans follow.  
  At September 30, 2016, the HSBC Group had 5 loans outstanding to an Iranian petrochemical company. These loans are supported by the official export credit agencies of the following countries: the United Kingdom, South Korea and Japan. The HSBC Group continues to seek repayments from the Iranian company under the outstanding loans in accordance with their original maturity profiles.  
  
   79 

HSBC Finance Corporation 

Two loans to the same company which were supported by the German and South Korean Export Credit Agencies matured during the third quarter of 2016 following receipt of the final repayments.  
  Estimated gross revenue to the HSBC Group generated by the loans in repayment for the third quarter of 2016, which includes interest and fees, was approximately $112,000, and net estimated profit was approximately $111,000. While the HSBC Group intends to continue to seek repayment under the existing loans, all of which were entered into before the petrochemical sector of Iran became a target of U.S. sanctions, it does not currently intend to extend any new loans.  
  Legacy contractual obligations related to guarantees    Between 1996 and 2007, the HSBC Group provided guarantees to a number of its non-Iranian customers in Europe and the Middle East for various business activities in Iran. In a number of cases, the HSBC Group issued counter indemnities in support of guarantees issued by Iranian banks as the Iranian beneficiaries of the guarantees required that they be backed directly by Iranian banks. The Iranian banks to which the HSBC Group provided counter indemnities included Bank Tejarat, Bank Melli, and the Bank of Industry and Mine.  
  There was no measurable gross revenue in the third quarter of 2016 under those guarantees and counter indemnities. The HSBC Group does not allocate direct costs to fees and commissions and, therefore, has not disclosed a separate net profit measure. The HSBC Group is seeking to cancel all relevant guarantees and counter indemnities and does not currently intend to provide any new guarantees or counter indemnities involving Iran. None were canceled in the third quarter of 2016 and approximately 20 remain outstanding.  
  Other relationships with Iranian banks    Activity related to U.S.-sanctioned Iranian banks not covered elsewhere in this disclosure includes the following:  
             
    The HSBC Group maintains several frozen accounts in the United Kingdom for an Iranian-owned, U.K.-regulated financial institution. Transactions relating to these accounts have been carried out under U.K. government license (or, particularly following Implementation Day under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action relating to the Iranian nuclear program, are generally permissible under applicable law). Estimated gross revenue in the third quarter of 2016 for these transactions, which includes fees and/or commissions, was approximately $32,700. 
                
    The HSBC Group acts as the trustee and administrator for a pension scheme involving five employees of a U.S.-sanctioned Iranian bank in Hong Kong, one of whom joined the scheme during the third quarter of 2016. Under the rules of this scheme, the HSBC Group accepts contributions from the Iranian bank each month and allocates the funds into the pension accounts of the Iranian bank s employees. The HSBC Group runs and operates this pension scheme in accordance with Hong Kong laws and regulations. Estimated gross revenue, which includes fees and/or commissions, generated by this pension scheme in the third quarter of 2016 was approximately $2,340. 
     For the Iranian bank related-activity discussed in this section, the HSBC Group does not allocate direct costs to fees and commissions and, therefore, has not disclosed a separate net profit measure. The HSBC Group currently intends to continue to wind down this activity, to the extent legally permissible, and not enter into any new such activity.  
  Activity related to U.S. Executive Order 13224    The HSBC Group maintained a credit card account for an individual sanctioned under U.S. Executive Order 13224 during the third quarter of 2016. The credit card has now been canceled. During the third quarter of 2016, the credit card was used for one minor debit transaction, and the HSBC Group received a payment relative to the credit card. 
  For activity related to U.S. Executive Order 13224, there was no measurable gross revenue or net profit generated to the HSBC Group in the third quarter of 2016. 
  Other activity   The HSBC Group held a lease of branch premises in London which it entered into in 2005 and was due to expire in 2010. The landlord of the premises is owned by the Iranian government. The HSBC Group exercised the break clause in the lease and exited the property during 2015. During the third quarter of 2016, the HSBC Group paid all outstanding rent and service charges to the landlord, and also made a payment to a third party company that dealt with refurbishment to the property.   
  For the activity in this section, there was no measurable gross revenue or net profit to HSBC in the third quarter of 2016. 
  Frozen accounts and transactions      The HSBC Group maintains several accounts that are frozen under relevant sanctions programs and on which no activity, except as licensed or otherwise authorized, took place during the third quarter of 2016.There was no measurable gross revenue or net profit to the HSBC Group in the third quarter of 2016 relating to these frozen accounts.
