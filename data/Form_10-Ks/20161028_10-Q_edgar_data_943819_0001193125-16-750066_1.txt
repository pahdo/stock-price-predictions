  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies         Organization and Basis of Presentation       ResMed Inc.
(referred to herein as  we ,  us ,  our  or the  Company ) is a Delaware corporation formed in March 1994 as a holding company for the ResMed Group. Through our subsidiaries, we design, manufacture and market
equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing and other respiratory disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea. Our manufacturing operations are located in Australia, Singapore, France, Malaysia and the United States.
Major distribution and sales sites are located in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, Norway and Sweden.      The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring items, have been included in the accompanying financial statements to present fairly the results of the interim periods. The results of
operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2017.      The condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto included in our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.       New Accounting Pronouncements    
  In May, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU), ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with
Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP
when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. Early application is not permitted. We are currently assessing the impact on our financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows as a result of the adoption of ASU 2014-09, however, we do not expect this updated standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   
  In April, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . ASU
2015-03 will more closely align the presentation of debt issuance costs under U.S. GAAP with the presentation under comparable International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by requiring that debt issuance costs be presented on the balance sheet
as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. The new standard was effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As a result of the adoption, we reclassified debt issuance costs of $0.6 million and
$1.7 million, from other assets to short-term debt and long-term debt, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income,
stockholders  equity, or cash flows.      In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the
Measurement of Inventory  which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope of this ASU at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less
reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amendments in this guidance more closely align the measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in IFRS. The new standard is effective for us
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We do not expect this updated standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases . Under the new guidance, lessees are required to
recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases classified as operating leases under current GAAP. This ASU is effective for the company beginning July 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our
consolidated financial statements.      In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which requires companies to recognize additional tax benefits or expenses related to the vesting or settlement of employee share-based awards (the difference between the actual benefit for tax purposes
and the tax benefit initially recognized for financial reporting purposes) as income tax benefit or expense in earnings, rather than in additional paid-in capital, in the reporting period in which they occur. This ASU also requires companies to
classify cash flows resulting from employee share-based payments, including the additional tax benefits or expenses related to the vesting or settlement of share-based awards, as cash flows from operating activities rather than financing activities.
The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt this ASU during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and are therefore required to report the
impacts as though the ASU had been adopted on July 1, 2015. Accordingly, we recognized a reduction in income tax expense and an increase in operating cash flows related to the vesting or settlement of employee share-based awards of $2.5 million in
each of the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.

  Earnings Per Share        Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. For purposes of calculating diluted
earnings per share, the denominator includes both the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and the number of dilutive common stock equivalents such as stock options and restricted stock units.   
  Stock options and restricted stock units of 264,672 and 98,697, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.      Basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are calculated as follows (in thousands except per share data):

  Cost-Method Investments        The
aggregate carrying amount of our cost-method investments at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, was $36.6 million and $33.8 million, respectively, and is included in the non-current balance of other assets on the condensed consolidated balance
sheets.     We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our cost-method investments, when events and
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. We estimate the fair value of our cost-method investments to assess whether impairment losses shall be recorded using Level 3 inputs. These investments include
our holdings in privately held service and research companies that are not exchange traded and therefore not supported with observable market prices. However, these investments are valued by reference to their net asset values that can be market
supported and unobservable inputs including future cash flows. We have determined that the fair value of our cost-method investments exceed their carrying values.   
  The following table shows a reconciliation of the changes in our cost-method investments during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):       

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015 were as follows (in

  Other Intangible Assets        Other
intangible assets were comprised of the following as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 (in thousands):       
    Intangible assets consist of developed/core product technology, trade names, non-compete
agreements, customer relationships, and patents, and we amortize them over the estimated useful life of the assets, generally between two and fifteen years. There are no expected residual values related to these intangible assets. In-process
research and development is amortized over the estimated useful life of the assets, once the research and development efforts are completed. At least on an annual basis, we evaluate the in-process research and development balances for impairment.

    Debt at
September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands):       
     Credit Facility    
  On October 31, 2013, we entered into a revolving credit agreement, as borrower, with lenders, including Union Bank, N.A.,
as administrative agent, joint lead arranger, swing line lender and letters of credit issuer, and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as syndication agent and joint lead arranger, providing for a revolving credit facility of $700 million, with an
uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300 million. On April 4, 2016, in connection with our acquisition of Brightree LLC ( Brightree ), we entered into a first amendment to the revolving credit
agreement to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from $700 million to $1 billion, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300 million, and to make other modifications to provide for the
acquisition of Brightree. The credit facility terminates on October 31, 2018, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. The outstanding principal amount due under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to
LIBOR plus 1.0% to 2.0% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). At September 30, 2016, the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amount was 2.0%. A commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.25% (depending on the
then-applicable leverage ratio) applies on the unused portion of the credit facility. The credit facility also includes a $25 million sublimit for letters of credit.   
  Our obligations under the revolving credit agreement are unsecured but are guaranteed by certain of our direct and
indirect U. S. subsidiaries, including ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc., Birdie Inc., Inova Labs, Inc., Brightree, Brightree Services LLC, Brightree Home Health   Hospice LLC and Strategic AR LLC, under an unconditional guaranty. The
credit agreement contains customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and an obligation that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum leverage ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) and an
interest coverage ratio.      At September 30, 2016, there was $875.0 million outstanding under the revolving
credit facility.       Term Loan    
  On April 4, 2016, in connection with the Brightree acquisition, we also entered into a credit agreement (the  term
loan credit agreement ) providing a $300 million senior unsecured one-year term loan credit facility.      Our
obligations under the term loan credit agreement are unsecured but are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries, including ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc., Birdie Inc., Inova Labs, Inc., Brightree, Brightree
Services LLC, Brightree Home Health   Hospice LLC and Strategic AR LLC, under an unconditional guaranty. The term loan credit facility terminates on April 3, 2017, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. The
outstanding principal amount due under the term loan credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.0% to 2.0% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). At September 30, 2016, the interest rate that was being charged on
the outstanding principal amount was 2.0%. The term loan credit agreement contains customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and an obligation that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum ratio of funded debt to
EBITDA (as defined in the term loan credit agreement) and an interest coverage ratio.      The proceeds from the
funding of the term loan credit facility were used to pay a portion of the acquisition consideration for the Brightree acquisition, as well as to pay fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition, the amendment to the revolving credit
agreement and the term loan credit agreement.      At September 30, 2016, there was $300.0 million outstanding
under the term loan credit agreement.

  Stock-Based Employee Compensation        We measure the compensation expense of all stock-based awards at fair value on the grant date. We estimate the fair value of stock options and purchase rights granted under the employee stock
purchase plan (the  ESPP ) using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock units is equal to the market value of the underlying shares as determined at the grant date less the fair value of dividends that
holders are not entitled to, during the vesting period. The fair value of performance restricted stock units which contain a market condition, are estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. We recognize the fair value as compensation
expense using the straight-line method over the service period for awards expected to vest.      We estimate the
fair value stock options granted under our stock option plans and purchase rights granted under the ESPP using the following assumptions:

  Stockholders  Equity         Common Stock.  Since the inception of our share repurchase programs and through September 30, 2016, we have repurchased a total of 41.1 million shares at a cost of $1.5 billion. Shares that are
repurchased are classified as treasury stock pending future use and reduce the number of shares outstanding used in calculating earnings per share. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent
acquisitions. Accordingly, we did not repurchase any shares during the three months ended September 30, 2016. There is no expiration date for this program, and the program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time at
the discretion of our board of directors. At September 30, 2016, 13.6 million additional shares can be repurchased under the approved share repurchase program.       Preferred Stock.    In April 1997, the board of directors designated 2,000,000 shares of our $0.01 par value preferred stock as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. No shares were
issued or outstanding at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.       Stock Options and Restricted Stock
Units.  We have granted stock options and restricted stock units to personnel, including officers and directors, in accordance with the ResMed Inc. 2009 Incentive Award Plan (the  2009 Plan ). The options have expiration dates of
seven years from the date of grant and the options and restricted stock units vest over one to four years. We have granted the options with an exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant.   
  The maximum number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance under the 2009 Plan is 43.7 million shares. The
number of securities remaining available for future issuance under the 2009 Plan at September 30, 2016 is 12.1 million. The number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 2009 Plan will be reduced by (i) 2.8 shares
for each one share of common stock delivered in settlement of any  full-value award,  which is any award other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or other award for which the holder pays the intrinsic value and (ii) one
share for each share of common stock delivered in settlement of all other awards. The maximum number of shares, that may be subject to awards granted under the 2009 Plan to any individual during any calendar year, may not exceed 3 million
shares of our common stock (except in a participant s initial year of hiring, when up to 4.5 million shares of our common stock may be granted).      At September 30, 2016, there were $54.4 million in unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. This is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of 2.1 years. The aggregate intrinsic value of the stock-based compensation arrangements outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2016 was $161.5 million and $37.0 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of the
options exercised during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $8.8 million and $8.9 million, respectively.

less than 3 months and no more than 27 months. The purchase price for our common stock under the ESPP will be the lower of 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant or 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on
the date of purchase. An individual participant cannot subscribe for more than $25,000 in common stock during any calendar year. At September 30, 2016, the number of shares remaining available for future issuance under the ESPP is 1.2 million
shares.

  Fair Value Measurements        In determining the fair value measurements of our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal and most advantageous market in which we transact and consider assumptions that market
participants would use when pricing the financial asset or liability. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.   
  The hierarchies of inputs are as follows:       

Level 1:  
      
    Input prices quoted in an active market for identical financial assets or liabilities;    

Level 2:  
      
    Inputs other than prices quoted in Level 1, such as prices quoted for similar financial assets and liabilities in active markets, prices for identical assets and
liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and    

Level 3:  
      
    Input prices quoted that are significant to the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities which are not observable nor supported by an active
market.    
    The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities, as at September 30,
2016 and June 30, 2016, using the valuation input hierarchy (in thousands):       
    We determine the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities as follows:

Foreign currency hedging instruments   These financial instruments are valued using third-party valuation models based on market observable inputs, including interest rate
curves, on-market spot currency prices, volatilities and credit risk.   

Contingent consideration   These liabilities include the fair value estimates of additional future payments that may be required for some of our previous business acquisitions
based on the achievement of certain performance milestones. Each potential future payment is valued using the estimated probability of achieving each milestone, which is then discounted to present value.   
    The following is a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of contingent consideration
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):       
    We did not have any significant non-financial assets or liabilities measured at fair
value on September 30, 2016 or June 30, 2016.

  Legal Actions and Contingencies     
   Litigation       In the normal course of business, we are subject to routine litigation incidental to our business. While the results of this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that their final
outcome will not, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.       Contingent Obligations Under Recourse Provisions       We use
independent leasing companies to provide financing to certain customers for the purchase of our products. In some cases, and within certain limits, we are liable to the leasing companies in the event of a customer default for unpaid installment
receivables transferred to the leasing companies. The gross amount of receivables sold with recourse during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amounted to $17.3 million and $16.1 million, respectively. The maximum potential amounts
of contingent liability under these arrangements at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 were $14.4 million, and $12.9 million, respectively. The recourse liability recognized by us at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, in relation to these
arrangements was $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively.       

(14)  
  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities        We transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian and Singapore dollars. We have significant foreign currency exposure through
both our Australian and Singaporean manufacturing activities, and international sales operations. We have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options and forward contracts to hedge
foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities and manufacturing cash flows. The terms of such foreign currency hedging contracts generally do not exceed three years. The goal of this hedging program is to economically manage
the financial impact of foreign currency exposures denominated mainly in Euros, and Australian and Singapore dollars. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated financial assets, liabilities, and firm
commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments.      We do not designate these
foreign currency contracts as hedges. We have determined our hedge program to be a non-effective hedge as defined under the FASB issued authoritative guidance. All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency instruments are recorded
within other income, net in our condensed consolidated statements of income. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.   
  We held foreign currency instruments with notional amounts totaling $651.0 million and $612.2 million at September 30,
2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, to hedge foreign currency fluctuations. These contracts mature at various dates prior to September 30, 2019.     The following table summarizes the amount and location of our derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 (in thousands):   
   
    The following table summarizes the amount and location of gains (losses) associated with
our derivative financial instruments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (in thousands):       
    We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counter parties
to financial instruments. We minimize counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with major financial institutions and we do not expect material losses as a result of default by our counterparties.

  Business Combinations     
   Brightree       On April 4, 2016 we completed the acquisition of Brightree LLC ( Brightree ), a provider of cloud-based clinical and business management software for the post-acute care industry, for a total
purchase consideration paid of $804 million. This acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using purchase accounting and included in our consolidated financial statements from April 4, 2016. The acquisition was funded
through cash on-hand, funds available from our revolving credit facility and a new $300 million senior unsecured one-year term loan credit facility.      We have not completed the purchase price allocation in relation to this acquisition as certain appraisals associated with the valuation of intangible assets are not yet complete. We do not believe
that the completion of this work will materially modify the preliminary purchase price allocation. We expect to complete our purchase price allocation during the quarter ending December 31, 2016. The cost of the acquisition was
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The goodwill recognized as part of these acquisitions, which is deductible for tax purposes, mainly represents the synergies
that are unique to our combined businesses and the potential for new products and services to be developed in the future. The preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the estimated useful lives of intangible assets
acquired are as follows (in thousands):

    Other Acquisitions    
  On October 2, 2015 we completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares in Curative Medical Technology Inc., a leading
provider of non-invasive ventilation and sleep-disordered breathing medical devices and accessories in China. Curative Medical has its manufacturing base in Suzhou, China, offices in Beijing, Germany and the United States, and a distributor
network throughout China and in other select markets.     On November 6, 2015 we completed the acquisition of 100%
of the shares in Maribo Medico A/S, a distributor of medical equipment for treating, diagnosing, and managing sleep-disordered breathing and other respiratory disorders in Denmark and the Nordics.   
  On November 30, 2015 we completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares in Bennett Precision Tooling Pty Ltd, an
Australian based company that designs and manufactures tools specializing in applications for Liquid Silicon Rubber.      On January 29, 2016 we completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares in Inova Labs Inc. ( Inova Labs ), a medical device company specializing in the development and commercialization of
innovative oxygen therapy products.      These acquisitions have been accounted for as business combinations using
purchase accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. The acquisitions, individually and collectively, are not considered a material business combination and accordingly pro forma
information is not provided. The acquisitions were funded through cash on-hand and by drawing on our existing credit facility.     Except for the purchase price allocation associated with the Inova Labs acquisition, we have completed the purchase price allocation in relation to all these acquisitions. We expect to complete our
purchase price allocation for Inova Labs during the quarter ending December 31, 2016. We do not believe that the completion of this work will materially modify the preliminary purchase price allocation for Inova Labs. The cost of the
acquisitions was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The goodwill recognized as part of these acquisitions, which is not deductible for tax purposes, mainly
represents the synergies that are unique to our combined businesses and the potential for new products and services to be developed in the future.

    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations        Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements    
  This report contains or may contain certain forward-looking statements and information that are based on the beliefs of our management as
well as estimates and assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. All statements other than statements regarding historical facts are forward-looking statements. The words  believe,   expect, 
 intend,   anticipate,   will continue,   will,   estimate,   plan,   future  and other similar expressions, and negative statements of such expressions, generally identify
forward-looking statements, including, in particular, statements regarding the development and approval of new products and product applications, market expansion, pending litigation, pending or consummated acquisitions and the development of new
markets for our products, such as cardiovascular and stroke markets. These forward-looking statements are made in accordance with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect the views of our management at the time the statements are made and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions, including, without
limitation, and in addition to those identified in the text surrounding such statements, those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and elsewhere in this report.  
  In addition, important factors to consider in evaluating such forward-looking statements include changes or developments in healthcare
reform, social, economic, market, legal or regulatory circumstances, changes in our business or growth strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to changes in our industry or the economy generally, the emergence of new or growing
competitors, the actions or omissions of third parties, including suppliers, customers, competitors and governmental authorities and various other factors. If any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying estimates or
assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from those expressed in our forward-looking statements, and there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this report will in fact occur.   
  Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described in our annual report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this report and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), including our
subsequent reports on  Forms 10-Q  and 8-K. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may
also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market
price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.

   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    
     
    Overview       The following is an overview of our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is
intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of ResMed Inc. Management s discussion and analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the selected financial data and
condensed consolidated financial statements and notes, included in this report.      We are a global leader in the development,
manufacturing, distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloud-based software applications that diagnose, treat and manage respiratory disorders including sleep disordered breathing ( SDB ), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases. SDB includes obstructive sleep apnea and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. Our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic
disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings. Our cloud-based software digital health applications, along with our devices are designed to
provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of untreated SDB, and to grow our business
in this market.      Since the development of continuous positive airway pressure therapy, we have expanded our business by
developing or acquiring a number of products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems for use in the
hospital and home, headgear and other accessories, dental devices, portable oxygen concentrators and cloud-based software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes. Our growth has been fueled by
geographic expansion, our research and product development efforts, acquisitions and an increasing awareness of SDB and respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as significant health concerns. During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, we invested $34.4 million on research and development activities with a continued focus on the development and commercialization of new, innovative products and solutions that improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our
customers and help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and lower healthcare costs.      During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, our net revenue increased by 13% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross margin was 57.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 58.0% for the three months ended September 30,
2015. Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.54 per share, compared to $0.58 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2015.     At September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $781.7 million, our total assets were $3.3 billion and our stockholders  equity was $1.8 billion.  
  In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency
fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a  constant currency basis , which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. In order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current
period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. However, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to U.S. dollar measures
that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

    Net Revenue       Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $465.4 million from $411.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $53.8 million or 13% (also a 13%
increase on a constant currency basis). Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 includes revenue of $33.1 million from Brightree s operations. Excluding revenue attributable to Brightree, net revenue for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $432.4 million, an increase of $20.7 million or 5% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 (also a 5% increase on a constant currency basis). The increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit
sales of our devices and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. Movements in international currencies against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $1.6 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016.     Net revenue in North and Latin America for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $301.0
million from $254.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $46.9 million or 18%. Excluding revenue attributable to Brightree, net revenue in North and Latin America increased for the three months ended September 30,
2016 to $267.9 million, an increase of $13.8 million or 5%. The increase in net revenue in North and Latin America, excluding revenue attributable to Brightree, is primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our devices and accessories, partially
offset by a decline in average selling prices.      Net revenue in markets outside North and Latin America increased for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 to $164.5 million from $157.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $7.0 million or 4% (a 5% increase on a constant currency basis). The constant currency increase in sales outside
North and Latin America predominantly reflects an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices.      Net revenue from devices for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $259.2 million from $239.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $19.4 million or 8%,
including an increase of 10% in North and Latin America and an increase of 6% outside North and Latin America (a 6% increase on a constant currency basis). Net revenue from masks and other accessories for the three months ended September 30, 2016
increased to $173.2 million from $172.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of 1%, with revenue in North and Latin America remaining consistent with the prior year and an increase of 2% outside North and Latin America
(a 4% increase on a constant currency basis). Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, device sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 8%, and masks and accessories sales increased by 1%, compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2015.     The following table summarizes the percentage movements in our net revenue, excluding revenue

30, 2016 to $269.2 million from $238.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $30.6 million or 13%. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 57.8%, which included a
field safety notification expense of $5.1 million relating to the replacement of the potential faulty battery in our Astral ventilation device. Excluding the field safety notification expense, the gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 was 58.9%, which was an increase from 58.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in gross margins was primarily due to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and an incremental
contribution from the Brightree acquisition, partly offset by an unfavorable product mix as sales of our lower margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales and declines in our average selling prices.

    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $128.9 million from $111.1 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $17.8 million or 16%. Selling, general and administrative expenses were unfavorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which increased our
expenses by approximately $0.8 million, as reported in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 15% compared to the
three months ended September 30, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net revenue, were 27.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 27.0% for the three months ended September 30,
2015.     The constant currency increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional expenses
associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions, an increase in the number of additional personnel to support our commercial activities and increased legal expenses. Excluding the incremental selling, general and administrative expenses
attributed to our recent acquisitions, selling, general and administrative for the quarter increased by 6% in constant currency terms.  
   Research and Development Expenses       Research and development expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $34.4 million from $27.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $7.3 million, or
27%. Research and development expenses were unfavorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which increased our expenses by approximately $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as
reported in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses increased by 21% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses, as a percentage of net
revenue, were 7.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 6.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.      The increase in research and development expenses in constant currency terms was primarily due to additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions, an increase in the number of
research and development personnel and increases in materials and tooling costs incurred to facilitate development of new products and additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions. Excluding the incremental research
and development expenses attributed to our recent acquisitions, research and development expenses for the quarter increased by 8% in constant currency terms.      Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets       Amortization of acquired
intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $11.7 million, compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in amortization expense was attributable to our recent acquisitions, in
particular Brightree, Curative Medical and Inova Labs.       Total Other (Loss) Income, Net    
  Total other (loss) income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was a loss of $1.2 million, compared to income of $1.4
million, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The loss was attributable to an increase in interest expense due to higher borrowings and lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on cash balances held which were partially
offset by foreign currency hedging gains due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar and Euro.       Income Taxes
      Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately 18.1% as compared to
approximately 16.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our effective income tax rate is affected by the geographic mix of our taxable income, including the lower taxes associated with our Singapore and Malaysia manufacturing operations.
Our Singapore and Malaysia operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through June 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2016, we have not provided for U.S. income
taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We intend these earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the United States.       Net Income and Earnings per Share       As a result of the factors above, our
net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $76.1 million compared to net income of $82.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of 8% over the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
  Our diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $0.54 per diluted share, compared to $0.58 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of 7% over the three months ended September 30, 2015.

    Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $781.7 million and $731.4 million, respectively. Working
capital was $854.3 million and $781.7 million, at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.     As of September 30, 2016
and June 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalent balances held within the United States amounted to $31.8 million and $40.9 million, respectively. Our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, of $749.9
million and $690.5 million, respectively, were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries and would be subject to tax if repatriated. If these funds were needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay United States
taxes to repatriate these funds. However, we intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our United States operations. Our cash and cash
equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions.     Inventories at September 30, 2016 were $253.8 million, an
increase of $29.4 million or 13% from the June 30, 2016 balance of $224.5 million. The increase in inventories was mainly to support the increase in unit sales.      Accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 were $347.1 million, a decrease of $34.9 million or 9% compared to the June 30, 2016 balance of $382.1 million. Accounts receivable days outstanding of 66
days at September 30, 2016 were higher than the 63 days at June 30, 2016. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 was 3.2%, compared to 3.2% at June 30, 2016.  
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we generated cash of $86.2 million from operations compared to $124.6 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The lower level of cash generated from operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily driven by the increase in our inventories and the timing of our corporate income tax payments.
Movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2016 had the effect of increasing our cash and cash equivalents by $17.2 million, as reported in U.S. dollars. We have temporarily suspended our share
repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. As a result, we did not repurchase any shares during the three months ended September 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we also paid dividends totaling $46.4
million and $42.1 million, respectively.      Capital expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted
to $14.6 million and $16.4 million, respectively. The capital expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily reflected investment in computer hardware and software, production tooling, equipment and machinery, and rental and
loan equipment. At September 30, 2016, our balance sheet reflects net property, plant and equipment of $390.8 million compared to $384.3 million at June 30, 2016.      Details of contractual obligations at September 30, 2016 are as follows:       

*  
    The above guarantees mainly relate to requirements under contractual obligations with insurance companies transacting with our German subsidiaries
and guarantees provided under our facility leasing obligations.

    Credit Facility       On October 31, 2013, we entered into a revolving credit agreement, as borrower, with lenders, including Union Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger, swing line lender and letters of
credit issuer, and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as syndication agent and joint lead arranger, providing for a revolving credit facility of $700 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional
$300 million. On April 4, 2016, in connection with our acquisition of Brightree LLC ( Brightree ), we entered into a first amendment to the revolving credit agreement to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from $700 million
to $1 billion, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300 million, and to make other modifications to provide for the acquisition of Brightree. The credit facility terminates on October 31, 2018,
when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. The outstanding principal amount due under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.0% to 2.0% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). At
September 30, 2016, the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amount was 2.0%. A commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.25% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio) applies on the unused portion of the credit
facility. The credit facility also includes a $25 million sublimit for letters of credit.      Our obligations under the revolving
credit agreement (as amended) are unsecured but are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect U. S. subsidiaries, including ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc., Birdie Inc., Inova Labs, Inc., Brightree, Brightree Services LLC,
Brightree Home Health   Hospice LLC and Strategic AR LLC, under an unconditional guaranty. The credit agreement contains customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and an obligation that we maintain certain financial ratios,
including a maximum leverage ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) and an interest coverage ratio.      At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the debt covenants under the revolving credit agreement and there was $875.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.   
   Term Loan       On April 4,
2016, in connection with the Brightree acquisition, we also entered into a credit agreement (the  term loan credit agreement ) providing a $300 million senior unsecured one-year term loan credit facility.   
  Our obligations under the term loan credit agreement are unsecured but are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect U.S.
subsidiaries, including ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc., Birdie Inc., Inova Labs, Inc., Brightree, Brightree Services LLC, Brightree Home Health   Hospice LLC and Strategic AR LLC, under an unconditional guaranty. The term loan
credit facility terminates on April 3, 2017, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. The outstanding principal amount due under the term loan credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.0% to
2.0% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). At September 30, 2016, the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amount was 2.0%. The term loan credit agreement contains customary covenants, including certain
financial covenants and an obligation that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the term loan credit agreement) and an interest coverage ratio.   
  The proceeds from the funding of the term loan credit facility were used to pay a portion of the acquisition consideration for the
Brightree acquisition, as well as to pay fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition, the amendment to the revolving credit agreement and the term loan credit agreement.   
  At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the debt covenants under the term loan credit agreement and there was $300.0 million
outstanding under the term loan credit agreement. We plan to refinance the facility prior to the maturity date of the term loan agreement, based on our funding needs at that time.   
  We expect to satisfy all of our liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt
facilities.       Common Stock       We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. Accordingly, we did not repurchase any shares during the three months ended September 30, 2016. There is no
expiration date for this program, and the program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time at the discretion of our board of directors. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased 1.2 million
shares at a cost of $62.0 million.      As of September 30, 2016, we have repurchased a total of 41.1 million shares at a cost of
$1.5 billion. Shares that are repurchased are classified as treasury stock pending future use and reduce the number of shares outstanding used in calculating earnings per share. At September 30, 2016, 13.6 million additional shares can be
repurchased under the current share repurchase program.

    Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves,
warranty obligations, goodwill, potentially impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies.      We state
these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. The estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.      For a full discussion of our critical accounting policies, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.      Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements       See note 1 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.   
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       As of September 30, 2016, we are not involved in any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
   Foreign Currency Market Risk       Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, although the financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are maintained in their respective local currencies. We transact business in various foreign
currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian and Singapore dollar. We have significant foreign currency exposure through our Australian and Singapore manufacturing activities and our international sales
operations. We have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options and forward contracts to hedge foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities and manufacturing cash flows. The goal of this hedging
program is to economically manage the financial impact of foreign currency exposures predominantly denominated in euros, Australian dollars and Singapore dollars. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated
financial assets, liabilities, and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The foreign currency derivatives portfolio is
recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value and included in other assets or other liabilities. All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives are recorded within other income, net, on our condensed
consolidated statements of income.      The table below provides information (in U.S. dollars) on our significant
foreign-currency-denominated balances by legal entity functional currency as of September 30, 2016 (in thousands):

   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
     
   The table below provides information about our foreign currency derivative financial
instruments and presents the information in U.S. dollar equivalents. The table summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates, including foreign currency call options, collars and forward
contracts held at September 30, 2016. The table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by contractual maturity dates for our foreign currency derivative financial instruments, including the forward contracts used to hedge
our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. These notional amounts generally are used to calculate payments to be exchanged under the contracts (in thousands, except exchange rates).   
   
     Interest Rate Risk       We are exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents and debt. At September 30, 2016, we held cash and cash equivalents of $781.7
million principally comprised of bank term deposits and at-call accounts and are invested at both short-term fixed interest rates and variable interest rates. At September 30, 2016, we had total borrowings of $1,175.0 million, comprising a revolving
credit balance of $875.0 million and a term loan credit balance of $300.0 million, which are subject to variable interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2016, would not have had a
material impact on pretax income. We have no interest rate hedging agreements.

      Controls and Procedures    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
in our reports made pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance
management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.      As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2016.      There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Item 1   
   Legal Proceedings         We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims. Litigation is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. But we do not expect the outcome of these matters
to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements when taken as a whole.       BMC and
3B litigation.  ResMed is engaged in disputes with Chinese manufacturer BMC Medical Co., Ltd and its US distributor, 3B Medical, Inc. in several global forums. In 2013, we filed actions in the US and Germany against BMC and 3B to stop the
infringement of several ResMed patents. In 2014, the US International Trade Commission ruled that certain BMC masks infringed ResMed s patents and should be excluded from importation or sale in the US. BMC appealed the Commission s ruling.
At the request of the ITC and ResMed, the appeals court remanded the case to the Commission. The Commission has suspended the exclusion order during the pendency of the remand. A companion case in the US District Court for the Southern District of
California remains stayed pending a final decision in the International Trade Commission proceedings.      In 2013,
we initiated proceedings in Germany against BMC involving certain devices and mask assemblies we accused of patent infringement. In April 2016, ResMed and BMC settled the case against BMC s infringing mask assemblies when BMC agreed not to sell
infringing products in Germany. In May 2016, ResMed settled its infringement action against BMC s flow generators in Germany. Additional infringement proceedings against BMC flow generators are currently stayed while a validity decision on the
same patent is on appeal.      In 2015, BMC s U.S. distributor, 3B Medical, Inc., filed suit in the US
District Court for the Middle District of Florida against ResMed Inc. and ResMed Corp. for alleged federal and state antitrust violations. 3B subsequently named three ResMed customers as additional defendants. 3B alleges that in addition to
enforcing its patents, ResMed has entered into exclusive dealing arrangements with customers, tied sales of masks to sales of devices, and spread false information about 3B. 3B seeks treble damages and an injunction.   
  In February 2016, BMC filed patent infringement suits in Shanghai, China against ResMed s distribution subsidiary in
China. BMC asserts that ResMed s S9 devices infringe two BMC patents. ResMed has filed petitions to invalidate the BMC patents in the China Patent Review Board, and is defending the infringement proceedings in court. These proceedings are
pending.     In May 2016, the International Trade Commission initiated a second investigation of patent
infringement by BMC and 3B, based on alleged infringement of ResMed patents by BMC s RESmart and Luna flow generators. A companion case in the US District Court for the Southern District of California remains stayed pending a final decision in
the International Trade Commission proceedings.       Administrative subpoena.  In July 2016, we received a
federal administrative subpoena from the Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) of the Department of Health and Human Services. The subpoena contains a request for documents and other materials that relate primarily to industry offerings of
patient resupply software to home medical equipment providers. We are cooperating with the OIG to respond to its requests for documents and information.      Fisher   Paykel Healthcare patent litigation.  ResMed and Fisher   Paykel Healthcare are engaged in patent disputes in several global forums.   
  In August 2016, Fisher   Paykel HealthCare, or FPH, sued ResMed for patent infringement in US District Court for the
Southern District of California, accusing ResMed s Air 10 flow generators, ClimateLine heated tubing, and the Swift FX and Swift LT masks of infringing FPH s patents. ResMed denied infringement, has asserted that the patents are invalid,
and filed counterclaims for patent infringement against FPH s Simplus, Eson and Eson 2 masks. In August 2016, ResMed requested, and the US International Trade Commission later instituted, an investigation of patent infringement against the same
FPH masks.      Related court cases are now pending in New Zealand, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In August, the
Munich district court issued preliminary injunctions temporarily prohibiting sales of FPH s Simplus, Eson and Eson 2 masks in Germany.      Both ResMed and FPH have also filed proceedings in patent offices in the United States, Germany and Europe to invalidate many of the patents being asserted against the other party.

Item 2   
   Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds      
  Purchases of equity securities. On February 21, 2014, our board of directors approved our current share repurchase
program, authorizing us to acquire up to an aggregate of 20.0 million shares of our common stock. The program allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time for cash in the open market, or in negotiated or block transactions,
as market and business conditions warrant and subject to applicable legal requirements. There is no expiration date for this program, and the program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time at the discretion of our board
of directors. All share repurchases after February 21, 2014 have been executed under this program.      We have
temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. As a result, we did not repurchase any shares during the three months ended September 30, 2016. However, there is no expiration date for this program, and we may, at any
time, elect to resume the share repurchase program as the circumstances allow. Since the inception of the share buyback programs, we have repurchased 41.1 million shares at a total cost of $1.5 billion.
