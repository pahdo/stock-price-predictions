  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  June 30, 2015  

1. ORGANIZATIONS AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

China Bull Management Inc was incorporated in Nevada on December
17, 2010, under the laws of the State of Nevada, for the purpose of engaging in financial consulting services to the small or median
sized private companies in China that want to look for business partners, or agencies, or financing resources, or to become public
listing through IPO or reverse merger in the United States, or Canada. 

The Company is in the development stage with minimal operations. 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Accounting  

The accompanying audited financial statements and related notes
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP )
for annual financial information, and with the rules and regulations of SEC to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. 

The Company has elected a December 31 year-end. 

Development Stage Company  

The Company is a development stage company as defined by section
915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The Company has recognized no revenue since inception, and is still
devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced.
All losses accumulated since inception, have been considered as part of the Company s development stage activities. 

Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity
of Three and Six Months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph
820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs
to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: 

Level
1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 

Level
2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable
as of the reporting date. 

Level
3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data. 

The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis, consequently, the Company did not have any fair value adjustments for financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value at June 30, 2015, nor gains or losses are reported in the statement of operations
that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting
date for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company will apply paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for revenue recognition.  The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and
earned.  The Company will consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i)
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer,
(iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.   

Income Taxes  

The Company will account for income taxes under Section 740-10-30
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that
will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the
extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. 

The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ( Section 740-10-25 ). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or
expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.  Under Section 740-10-25, the Company
may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained
on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.  The tax benefits recognized in the
financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent
(50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.  The Company had
no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25. 

Net Loss Per Common Share  

Net loss per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during each period.
 There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of  June 30, 2015. 

3. GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying financial statements are presented on a going
concern basis. 

The Company had minimal operations during the period from December
17 (date of inception) to June 30, 2015 and generated little revenues of $35,920 including $0 in this quarter, and the Company's
current asset of $  1,741 is limited. This condition raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern. 

Continuation of the Company as a going concern dependents
upon obtaining additional working capital, and generating substantial revenue and profits. Management is doing the best to
find solution. 

Further, the operation of this company was haled since May
of 2013. Detail is in the following Item 2 of Management discussion. 

4. WARRANTS AND OPTIONS 

There are no warrants or options outstanding to acquire any additional
shares of common stocks. 

5. INCOME TAXES 

This
company is subject to Nevada and US tax codes. The company has no tax payable for this quarter.  

6. NET OPERATING INCOMES 

As of June 30, 2015, the Company has a net operating loss of
$   277 for this quarter. 

7. COMMON STOCK 

The stockholders' equity section of the Company contains the following
classes of capital stock as of  June 30, 2015: 

Common stock, $0.0001 par value: 75,000,000 shares authorized;
 1,108,596 shares issued and outstanding. 

8. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

None.

Condition And Results Of Operation

Special
Business interruption   

Due to third party wanting to change control, the
operation of the business was interrupted since May of 2013 and fully damaged for over 3 years and beyond. On June 19, 2013, the
FINRA announced to delete the trading at the quotation of the OTCBB, of the common stock of this company. Currently, the shares
only can be traded in the pinksheet. Although Andrew Chien wanted to recover the assets by legal action, but he will concentrate
most energy on the looking for new business opportunity under the new environment such as China has significant capital outflow
etc.  

BUSINESS
OVERVIEW:   

The
Company incorporated on December 17, 2010 in Nevada, and is in the development stage and only generated little of revenue,
and we have only one director: Mr. Chien, who isn t a registered invest adviser.  

However,
we believe that our business has the possible to be success because of our President's (Mr. Chien s) extensive education
and professional experience in the both U.S. and China make him, as our Director, some advantages in:  

contacts
                                         with some entrepreneurs in China;    

skill
                                         sets and experience in the business service field, including understanding some public
                                         company's legal, accounting and investor relationship issues;    

language
                                         skills of both Chinese and English;    

long
                                         time (over a dozen of years) working experiences in both China and USA; and    

work
                                         ethics and his determination to turn our business into a financial success.    

Since
2006, Andrew Chien has accumulated working experiences in managing a small public company and some contact with China small
financial consultants. The frequently and long time contact between Andrew Chien and his China partners is very
important because our manager believes that doing business in China for small or micro-capital companies, a trust relation is
more important than the brand name from the facts that, in most private owned companies, the top management team always is
arranged in members of one family rather than outside professionals. Our targeted projects are directly relative to the
owners  financial benefits, the owners will pick the trust people first rather than the professionals  brand
name. This is why Andrew Chine s long time working history and good relation with some Chinese entrepreneurs and
financial consultants are very important, and this makes us to have confidence that our company will be
successful.  

Target
Market  

Our
target market will be aggressive investors who is looking
   acquisitions, or small to medium size private companies in China or other countries, who is looking for private or
public financing with purposes to achieve China or oversea operation expansion; or looking for merger with
business partners in the United States, Canada or Europe, or looking for becoming publicly listed through either an IPO
(Initial Public Offering) or a  reverse  merger with a public  shell  company.  

We
will conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations of the cities, states and countries of which
we are conducting business. Currently, we do not need any special license or regulatory approval in the US or China to conduct
any of our services. We will strictly control our business practice, avoiding involving any areas in which any special license
or regulatory approval may need, or contracting the special services to outside qualified persons or companies.  

However,
there is no guarantee that we will obtain additional customers and earn additional revenues.  

We
believe that some customers may elect to issue us shares of their common stock for our services if they do not have adequate cash
resources .      

We
will market our service major through personal contacts, advertisers and media. In past five years, Mr. Chien at least traveled
to China once a year for business, he will continue to take extensive international travel to meet the owners and major managers
of the potential customers, and will make consistently communication through telephone and e-mail with them. Also he will periodically
join the associated conferences, and seminars to make wide contacts with potential customers. We also will make alliances with
partners or organizations located in US, and China to expand our business.  

Revenue
Stream   

Our
Company will realize revenue when we obtain customers, and charge those customers fees for our business services. We plan to charge
our customers on an annual basis, per project, rather than by the hours. We will survey our competition and adjust our fees to
be slightly lower than industry  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS:   

Revenue,
operating income and shareholder equity   

For the quarter ended of June 30, 2015, we have
generated revenue of $ 0, and net loss of $ (277); compared same period of last year of  $ 0 revenue and net loss of $ (255).
There was no  business activity.  

On June 30, 2015, we have shareholders  equity of
$1,741 compared with $2,295 on the December 31, 2014. The decrease of shareholder equity in this quarter is due to
depreciation of the equipment,   but no operation.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

We
believe that our current cash position of $  0 can t meet our operation requirement in the next twelve months. We don t
have any financing plan in the foreseeable future except the manager personally help.  

Item
3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosure About market Risk   

None . 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

An
evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Company's Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of period covered by this report. Based
on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent
fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
