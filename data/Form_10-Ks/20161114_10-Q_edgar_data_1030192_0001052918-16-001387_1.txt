New Jersey Mining Company  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  

1.  
  The Company and Significant Accounting Policies:  
   
 These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the management of New Jersey Mining Company (the  Company ) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim consolidated financial statements have been included. 
   
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of the Company's financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that the actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material effect on the reported amounts of the Company's financial position and results of operations. Operating results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016. 
   
 For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto in the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
   
   Principles of Consolidation   
 At September 30, 2016, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the accounts of our majority owned New Jersey Mill Joint Venture ( NJMJV ), Golden Chest LLC Joint Venture ( GCJV ) and GF H Company. Intercompany items and transactions between companies included in the consolidation are eliminated. The outstanding ownership of GCJV was acquired by the Company in December 2015. In August 2016, the Company acquired the remaining 33.3% outstanding shares of GF H and now owns 100% of GF H (Note 14). 
   
   Revenue Recognition   
 Revenue is recognized when title and risk of ownership of metals or metal bearing concentrate have passed and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of metals may be subject to adjustment upon final settlement of estimated metal prices, weights and assays, and are recorded as adjustments to revenue in the period of final settlement of prices, weights and assays; such adjustments are typically not material in relation to the initial invoice amounts. Revenue received from drilling and exploration contracts with third parties is recognized when the contract has been established, the services are rendered and collection of payment is deemed probable. These services are not a part of normal operations. Income received as the operator of the Company s joint ventures is recognized in the months during which those operations occur. Revenue received from engineering services provided is recognized when services are rendered and collection of payment is deemed probable. These services are not a part of normal operations. Revenues from mill operations and custom milling are recognized in the period in which the milling is completed, concentrates are shipped, and collection of payment is deemed probable. 
   
 Revenue from harvest of raw timber is recognized when a contract has been established, the timber has been shipped, and payment is deemed probable. These sales of timber found on the Company s mineral properties are not a part of normal operations. 
   
   Pre-Development Activities   
 Pre-development activities involve cost incurred in the exploration stage that may ultimately benefit production, such as underground ramp development, pumping, and open pit development, which are expensed due to the lack of evidence of economic development, which is necessary to demonstrate future recoverability of these expenses. These cost are charged to operations as incurred. 
   
   Reclassifications   
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 financial statement presentation. Reclassifications had no effect on net loss, stockholders  equity, or cash flows as previously reported. 
   
  Going Concern  
   
 As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had minimal revenue and a net loss of $828,756 and $1,144,006 respectively for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 as well as an accumulated deficit and negative working capital at September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
 The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue its operations.

  Joint Ventures  
   
 For joint ventures in which the Company holds more than 50% of the voting interest and has significant influence, the joint venture is consolidated with the presentation of non-controlling interest. For joint ventures in which the Company does not have joint control or significant influence, the cost method is used. For those joint ventures in which there is joint control between the parties and the Company has significant influence, the equity method is utilized.

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a change in fair value of $466,783. The fair value was calculated using the market approach with Level 2 inputs for forward gold contract rates and a discount rate of 10%.

Plan of Operation   
   
 The Company is utilizing its business experience and operational capabilities to advance its diversified cash flow plan. 
   
 The Company s strategy is to generate cash flow from milling fees, royalties, and possible future mine operations (as they are developed) with a view toward building an asset base focused on cash flow and/or production, thus reducing reliance on the capital markets. In recent examples, the Company has leveraged its property and mineral processing assets into joint ventures that brought exploration or development funding from partners. The strategy includes finding and developing potential mineral deposits of significant quality and quantity to justify investment in mining and/or mineral processing facilities. The Company s primary focus is on gold with silver and base metals of secondary emphasis. 
   
 The Company has a portfolio of mineral properties including: the Golden Chest Mine (placed in production in the 4 th  quarter of 2016), the Butte Highlands Mine (50% carried interest), the New Jersey Mine (historic mine adjacent to the New Jersey Mill), and several exploration prospects including the McKinley, Eastern Star, and Toboggan projects. The Company is also the manager and majority-owner of the New Jersey Mill Joint Venture, which when in operation, is capable of processing both silver and gold ores through a 360 tonne per day (tpd) flotation plant. 
   
 In recent years, the Company has focused its efforts on the development and consolidation of ownership of the Golden Chest Mine. As detailed below, the Golden Chest Joint Venture leased out a portion of the Golden Chest Mine from 2013 to 2015, resulting in gold production of 8,000 ounces from the property. During this period the Company generated revenue from processing the Golden Chest ores at its mill and from a modest NSR royalty. In 2015, the Company s milling activities contributed $1,886,421 to its consolidated revenue. The Company also conducted minimal exploration on its McKinley and Eastern Star projects during 2015. The Company is also examining other opportunities in the western USA to apply its development, operational, and processing expertise, including its recent purchase of a 50% interest in the Butte Highlands Gold Project near Butte, Montana. 
   
 During the third quarter of the 2016, building upon prior work and investment in the Golden Chest Project, the Company began development of the open pit, stockpiling and shipping ore, and dewatering of the underground workings. The Company also completed acquisition of the GF H, a private company that holds 374 acres of patented mining claims near the Golden Chest Project. 
   
 Through the third quarter of 2016, NJMC s progress includes: 

Announced anticipated commencement of open pit mining operations (See Company news release dated July 15, 2016). 
     
 Completed financing and announced plans to resume production at the Golden Chest Mine (See Company news release dated August 02, 2016). 
     
 Completed acquisition of GF H and began stockpiling of ore from the open pit at the Golden Chest (See Company news release dated August 30, 2016). 
     
 Discovered a new footwall vein in the open pit and ships first ore to the New Jersey Mill (See Company news release dated September 22, 2016). 

During the second quarter of 2016, the Company built upon progress made in the latter part 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 and focused largely on its goal to resume production at the Golden Chest. This included necessary permitting and site work along with raising the funding needed for the Golden Chest mine plan, as outlined the internal scoping study and subsequent mine plan. 
   
 Through the second quarter of 2016 NJMC s progress includes: 

Received permit to initiate open pit mining at Golden Chest (See Company news release dated June 21, 2016); 
     
 Advanced funding efforts for the forward sale of gold at $935/ounce, to be paid back over 2.5 years in gold produced from the Golden Chest. The offering closed subsequent to end of quarter (See Company news release dated August 2, 2016). 
   
 During the first quarter of 2016, the Company completed purchase of 50-percent interest in the Butte Highlands Joint Venture from Timberline Resources Corp. (See Company news release dated February 1, 2016). This acquisition fits into our plans to build upon our portfolio of assets having considerable prior investment and a path toward cash flow potential and/or in which we might provide our expertise to help advance the project or to provide milling services. More than $30-million has been invested at Butte Highlands to-date by Montana State Gold Company ( MSGC ) and prior funding partner, Highland Mining LLC. 
   
 Through Q1 of 2016 NJMC s progress includes (See Company news release dated March 29, 2016): 

Development of a small-scale, two-year mine plan at Golden Chest, focusing on easily-accessible near-mine ore, retaining all upside potential of up-dip, down-dip, and on-strike zones, as well as larger district-scale potential; 
     
 Purchase of underground haul truck and loader, receipt of long-lead electrical components, and agreement for use of BHJV-owned equipment, in anticipation of resumed production at Golden Chest. 
     
 Purchase of 50-percent interest in Butte Highlands Joint Venture (BHJV) which owns the Butte Highlands Gold Mine; 
     
 Signing Memorandum of Understanding with partner Highland Mining LLC for NJMC to assume control of Permitting and Management at BHJV. 

13 

The Company s focus during most of 2015 was focused on maintaining and running the New Jersey Mill in support of mining operations at the Golden Chest Mine. In anticipation of processing ores from the Golden Chest Mine, the Company invested in certain upgrades and expansions to the New Jersey Mill. The Company added a gravity processing circuit to the mill and expanded the tailings impoundment facility, among other minor modifications and adjustments. Gold Hill commenced construction and underground development during the third quarter of 2014, delivering the first ore to the New Jersey Mill in December of 2014. Mining activities continued during the year until Gold Hill ceased operations September, 2015 (See Company news release dated, September 21, 2015).  
   
 In October, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire 100-percent interest in the Golden Chest Mine from Marathon Gold Corporation, its joint venture partner in the project. It was considered by both parties that the Golden Chest Mine should have consolidated ownership going forward. The agreement with Marathon was completed in December (See Company news release dated December 4, 2015). The Company rendered payments of $180,000 to Marathon for its 52.22% interest in the Golden Chest Joint Venture and Marathon retained a 2% NSR on production from the Golden Chest, as well as an adjacent Area of Interest. An estimated $7-$9 million was spent by the lessee of the Skookum Shoot, which included mine development and infrastructure and any remaining mineralized material. 
   
 In May, 2015, the Company announced a realignment of management as it transitioned into an operating company to remain focused on cash flow and corporate overhead (See Company news release dated May 7, 2015). 
   
 In 2015, NJMC accomplishments and project milestones included (See Company news release dated March 29, 2016): 

Completion of mine development at the Golden Chest property, by Juniper Resources under the Skookum lease, totaling approximately $7 to $9-million; 
     
 Completion of upgrades and commencement of commercial operations at the New Jersey Mill, achieving revenue of more than $1.8 million; 
     
 Commercial production, achieved by Juniper at the Golden Chest Mine, totaling 40,840 dry metric tonnes of ore produced at an average grade of 6.65 grams of gold per tonne; 
     
 Production of approximately 8,000 ounces of gold from Golden Chest ore at the New Jersey Mill, including approximately 500 ounces of gold from a cyanide leaching project which led to a series of recommendations for improving the concentrate leach circuit; 
     
 Consolidation of 100-percent ownership of the Golden Chest project, after the departure of Juniper, with the buy-out of former partner Marathon Gold; 
     
 Completed internal scoping study at Golden Chest, outlining plans for resumed production of unmined ore from the Juniper mine plan and from other easily accessible zones. 
   
 Prior to recent activity, during 2011 and 2012, the New Jersey mineral processing plant was expanded in order to process ore from the nearby Crescent silver mine. NJMC executed a definitive venture agreement with United Silver Corp (USC) and its subsidiary United Mine Services (UMS), owner of the Crescent mine, in January 2011. The plant was expanded from a processing rate of 4 tonnes/hr to 15 tonnes/hr. USC paid the expansion cost, which was $3.2 million. The joint venture agreement anticipated that USC would be entitled to process up to 7,000 tonnes per month from the Crescent Mine and NJMC would have rights for up to 3,000 tonnes per month of capacity during the processing of Crescent ores. Under the agreement, each party would pay its processing costs and NJMC will charge a management fee of $2.50/tonne. The plant was commissioned during 2012, but ore production from the Crescent Mine was curtailed by USC for economic reasons so the plant became idle in September 2012. The mill remained idle through 2013 and most of 2014, until commissioning its new upgrades in November of 2014 (See Company news release dated November 12, 2014). 
   
 In April 2014, Hale Capital Partners, through its subsidiary Crescent Silver LLC ( Crescent Silver ), acquired the assets of United Mine Services in a consensual foreclosure process. This transaction included the UMS stake in the New Jersey Mill JV. Hence, Crescent Silver is the Company s current joint venture partner at the New Jersey Mill. Crescent Silver produced no ore during 2014. 
   
 NJMC geologists conducted limited programs at the McKinley and Eastern Star projects during 2014 and 2015. The Company drilled just under 400 meters of small-diameter core from the underground workings at McKinley. The drill results returned several high-grade intersections that may warrant follow-up, including 2.5m of 43.7 gpt Au and 3.5m of 18.5 gpt Au. The McKinley Project is at a very early stage of exploration, but there are high-grade (+30 gpt Au) showings over more than 3.8 kilometers of prospecting on the 1,800-hectare (4,443 acres) project, (see Company news release dated January 2, 2015). 
   
 During 2014 and 2015, the Company also conducted limited exploration work at the Eastern Star Project in the Elk City District of central Idaho. The property was acquired under a purchase option agreement with Premium Exploration Inc., (see Company news release dated April 25, 2014). In the first field season on the project, NJMC geologists collected rock samples and channel samples that included 11.34 gpt Au over 4.3 meters and 14.15 gpt over 0.9 meters. There has been no drilling at Eastern Star, so the project will require considerable additional work in order to assess its economic potential.  
   
 The Toboggan Project is a group of claims to the north of Golden Chest. Formerly joint ventured with Newmont Mining and including a lease agreement with Hecla Mining, the properties have seen well over $2.0 million in exploration investment in recent years. The gold prospects at Toboggan appear to be associated with alkalic intrusions and alteration is widespread. 

14 

At the Coleman underground mine, which is part of the New Jersey Mine and Mill property, the Company conducted no significant exploration during 2014 or 2015, but Company geologists are currently evaluating the known gold-bearing veins and historic targets for their future potential. Now that the New Jersey Mill is processing ores from the Golden Chest Mine, the potential economics of nearby gold prospects may have improved. 
   
   Changes in Financial Condition    
 The Company maintains an adequate cash balance by increasing or decreasing its exploration expenditures as limited by availability of cash from operations or from financing activities. The cash balance at September 30, 2016 was $483,114 compared to $62,275 at the end of 2015. 
   
   Results of Operations   
 There was $52,354 and $144,632 in revenue in the three and nine month periods, respectively ending September 30, 2016 compared to $603,129 and $1,866,499 for the comparable periods in 2015. The revenue in 2015 was from milling of ore at the Golden Chest Mine whereas minimal milling activity occurred in the first and second quarters of 2016. The net loss of $828,756 and $1,144,006 for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 compared to the net income of $120,087 and net loss of $17,955 in the comparable periods of 2015 are a result of reduced milling activity at the Company in 2016 and fair value adjustments related to the forward gold contracts entered into during July 2016. 
   
 The Company invested $191,374 in additional facilities at the mill in 2015 and processed ore from the Golden Chest (Skookum Project) that started production in December 2014 through the third quarter of 2015. The mining at the Golden Chest during this period was conducted by Gold Hill under a lease agreement. The Company has resumed production at the Golden Chest in the fourth quarter of 2016 with the Company as operator of both the mine and the mill. 
   
 The amount of money to be spent on exploration at the Company s mines and prospects depends primarily on contributions of our joint venture partners, fundraising, and cash flow from the Golden Chest mine and the mill. 
   
 The audit opinion and notes that accompany our consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016, disclose a  going concern  qualification to our ability to continue in business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. We are operating a start-up mineral processing operation, but we also remain an exploration stage company that has incurred losses since our inception. We do not have sufficient cash to fund normal operations and meet debt obligations for the next 12 months without seeing increased revenue from our milling and mining operations, deferring payment on certain current liabilities, and/or raising additional funds. We believe that the going concern condition cannot be removed with confidence until the Company has entered into a business climate where the stability of our business is more assured. We currently have no historical recurring source of revenue and our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to profitably execute our business plan or raise capital to fund our future exploration and working capital requirements. Our plans for the long-term return to and continuation as a going concern include growing milling revenues, sales of our common stock and/or debt, and the eventual profitable exploitation of our mining properties. 
   
 Additionally, the current capital markets and general economic conditions in the United States are significant obstacles to raising the required funds. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
