EXPLANATORY NOTE: 

The purpose of this Amendment No. 1 to
our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on November 3, 2016 (the  Original 10-Q ) is to provide updated disclosure in Part I. Item 4 to reflect material weaknesses
in the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and to correct certain typographical and formatting errors in the Original
10-Q. Subsequent to the filing of the Original 10-Q, the Company was made aware that its independent registered public accounting
firm had not completed its required review of the Original 10-Q. Once the Company's independent registered public accounting firm
completed its review of the Original 10-Q as filed, it concluded that while there were no changes in the financial statements
and no restatement of financial information, certain ministerial errors within the financial statements required correction and
certain comparative period disclosure had been inadvertently omitted from Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Information and Results of Operations   Results of Operations. The Items of this Form 10-Q/A which are amended
is Part I. Financial Statements   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations
(unaudited) and Note 1(a), Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures and Part I., Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Information and Results of Operations. As required, certain revisions were made in the accompanying XBRL files. This
Amendment No. 1 also contains currently dated certificates from the Company's principal executive officer and principal accounting
and financial officer in Exhibits 31.1, 31.2 and 32.1. The remaining Items contained in this Form 10-Q/A consist of all other
Items originally contained in the Original Form 10-Q as filed. This Form 10-Q/A does not reflect events occurring after the filing
of the Original Form 10-Q, nor modify or update those disclosures in any way other than as set forth herein.

   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

(A) Nature of Operations 

Ridgefield Acquisition Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Colorado on October 13, 1983. Effective June 23, 2006, the Company was reincorporated under the
laws of the State of Nevada through the merger of the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Since July 2000, the
Company has suspended all operations, except for necessary administrative matters. 

The Company has no principal operations or revenue producing
activities. The Company is now pursuing an acquisition strategy whereby it is seeking to arrange for a merger, acquisition or other
business combination with a viable operating entity. 

Effective March 1, 2015, the Company relocated
its principal offices to 31248 Oak Crest Drive, Suite 110, Westlake Village, California 91361. The registrant's new telephone number
is (805) 416-7054. The Company occupies a portion of the offices occupied by BKF Capital Group, Inc. on a month to month basis
for a monthly fee of $50 per month paid to BKF Capital Group, Inc. Steven N. Bronson, the Company's Chairman, CEO and controlling
shareholder, is also the Chairman, CEO and controlling shareholder of BKF Capital Group, Inc. 

(B) Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the
rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information. 

The financial information as of September 30, 2016 is derived
from the audited consolidated financial statements presented in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December
31, 2015 and 2014. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto, together with the Plan of Operations
for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included
in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have
been omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial reporting.
Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows. It is management's opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation. The interim results for
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. 

GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization
of assets and extinguishment of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying condensed interim financial
statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.63 million through  September 30, 2016. As of September
30, 2016, the Company has no principal operations or significant revenue producing activities, which raises substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not
include any adjustments related to the carrying value of assets or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company's ability to establish itself as a going concern is dependent
on its ability to merge with another entity. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 

RIDGEFIELD ACQUISITION CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY 

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

The Company had cash on hand in the amount of $513 and $768
as of September 30, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company has no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016
and as of December 31, 2015. 

INCOME PER COMMON SHARE 

Basic income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing
net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income per common share
is calculated by adjusting outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive equity instruments. There is no
difference in the calculation of basic and diluted income per share for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. 

USE OF ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

DUE TO RELATED PARTY 

Commencing in the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company's
president and principal executive officer has loaned the Company money to fund working capital needs to pay operating expenses.
The loans are repayable upon demand and accrue interest at the rate of 10% per annum. As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate principal
loan balance amounted to $89,450 and such loans have accrued interest of $15,859 through September 30, 2016. 

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15 ( ASU 2014-15 ),
Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to
Continue as a Going Concern. ASU 2014-15 requires a Company's management to evaluate, at each reporting period, whether there are
conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after
the date the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending
after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on its consolidated financial statements. 

Item 2.  
        Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Forward Looking Statements Disclosure  

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A (Amendment
No. 1) contains certain statements that are not historical facts, including, most importantly, information concerning possible
or assumed future results of operations of Ridgefield Acquisition Corp. (the  Company ) and statements preceded by, followed
by or that include the words  may,   believes,   expects,   anticipates,  or the negation
thereof, or similar expressions, which constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 (the  Reform Act ) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange
Act ). For those statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained
in the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and are susceptible to a number
of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks specifically enumerated in Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the Company's actual results, performance and achievements may differ materially from
any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The Company will not undertake
and specifically declines any obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions, which may be made to any forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or
unanticipated events. In addition, it is the Company's policy generally not to make any specific projections as to future earnings,
and the Company does not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties. 

The following discussion and analysis provides
information which the Company's management believes to be relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company's results
of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read together with the Company's financial statements and the
notes to financial statements, which are included in this report, as well as the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015. 

Acquisition Strategy  

The Company's plan of operation is to arrange
for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity.
The Company has not identified a viable operating entity for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement,
and there can be no assurance that the Company will ever successfully arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or
other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity. 

The Company anticipates that the selection
of a business opportunity will be a complex process and will involve a number of risks, because potentially available business
opportunities may occur in many different industries and may be in various stages of development. Due in part to depressed economic
conditions in a number of geographic areas, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available
capital, management believes that there are numerous firms seeking either the limited additional capital which the Company will
have or the benefits of a publicly traded corporation, or both. The perceived benefits of a publicly traded corporation may include
facilitating or improving the terms upon which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for principal shareholders,
creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, providing liquidity for all shareholders
and other factors. 

In some cases, management of the Company
will have the authority to effect acquisitions without submitting the proposal to the shareholders for their consideration. In
some instances, however, the proposed participation in a business opportunity may be submitted to the shareholders for their consideration,
either voluntarily by the Board of Directors to seek the shareholders' advice and consent, or because of a requirement of state
law to do so. 

In seeking to arrange a merger, acquisition,
business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, management's objective will
be to obtain long-term capital appreciation for the Company's shareholders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to complete any merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating
entity. 

The Company may need additional funds in
order to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, although
there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such additional funds, if needed. Even if the Company is able to
obtain additional funds there is no assurance that the Company will be able to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement
by and between the Company and a viable operating entity. 

Results of Operations  

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company incurred General and administrative expenses of $3,006 and $7,362, resulting in a net loss equal to
$5,254 and $9,185 respectively. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of
costs associated with maintaining the Company's status as a public company including (without limitation) filing reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred interest expense
of $2,248 and $1,823, respectively. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company incurred General and administrative expenses of $10,655 and $17,243, resulting in a net loss equal to
$16,842 and $21,712 respectively. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of
costs associated with maintaining the Company's status as a public company including (without limitation) filing reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred interest expense
of $6,187 and $4,469, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, the Company satisfied its working capital needs from cash on hand and loans from the Company s Chairman and President.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash on hand in the amount of $513. 

The Company's long term financial condition
will be subject to its ability to arrange for a merger, acquisition or a business combination with an operating business on favorable
terms that will result in profitability. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so or, if it is able to
do so, that the transaction will be on favorable terms not resulting in an unreasonable amount of dilution to the Company's existing
shareholders. 

The Company may need additional funds in
order to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, although
there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such additional funds, if needed. Even if the Company is able to
obtain additional funds there is no assurance that the Company will be able to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement
by and between the Company and a viable operating entity. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

We maintain  disclosure controls and
procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
principal executive officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation of disclosure and controls and procedures. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company initially carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of our Principal Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) in connection with the preparation
and filing of the Initial 10-Q. Based on the evaluation, the Company's Principal Executive Officer initially concluded that the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are operating
in an effective manner to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms. Subsequent to the filing of the Original 10-Q, the Company was made aware that its independent registered
public accounting firm had not completed its required review of the Original 10-Q. As a result, the Company's President, which
serves as its Principal Executive Officer and principal financial and accounting officer, concluded that the Company's disclosure
controls and procedures  were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report such that the information
relating to our company, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President who serves as our principal financial officer, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  The Company's approval
to file with Initial 10-Q prior to the completion of such review also is a material weakness in the Company's internal control
over financial reporting. The Company will institute additional internal controls and disclosure controls during the fourth quarter
of 2016 to remediate these material weaknesses.  

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. 

There have been no changes in the Company's
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during
Company's most recent quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal
control over financial reporting. 

It should be noted that any system of controls,
however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system
are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only reasonable assurance that the Company's
controls will succeed in achieving their stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings
