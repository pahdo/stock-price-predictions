   September 30, 2016   
   (Unaudited)   
     
   1.  General   
     
  Cavendish Futures Fund LLC (the  Fund ) is a Delaware limited liability company formed on August 7, 2012.  Trading operations of the Fund commenced on February 19, 2013.  The Fund s investment objective is to achieve capital appreciation through speculative trading in U.S. and international futures, options on futures and forward markets.  The Fund may also engage in swap and other derivative transactions upon approval of Sydling Futures Management LLC ( Sydling ).  The Fund privately and continuously offers redeemable units of limited liability company interest in the Fund ( Redeemable Units ) to qualified investors and subscriptions are generally accepted monthly.  There is no maximum number of Redeemable Units that may be sold by the Fund.  The Fund invests substantially all of its assets in the Sydling WNT Master Fund LLC ( Master Fund ), also a Delaware limited liability company, which has the same investment objective as the Fund.  The Master Fund s Statements of Financial Condition, including Condensed Schedules of Investments and Statements of Operations and Changes in Members  Capital are included herein.  The percentage of the Master Fund s capital owned by the Fund at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 100%.  The performance of the Fund is directly affected by the performance of the Master Fund.  
     
  The Fund is member managed for purposes of Delaware law.  Pursuant to the Fund s limited liability company agreement, as may be amended from time to time (the  LLC Agreement ), the members of the Fund (each, a  Member  and collectively, the  Members ) have appointed Sydling to act as the Fund s commodity pool operator and trading manager.  Sydling is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) as a commodity pool operator and a commodity trading advisor and is a member of the National Futures Association ( NFA ) effective August 10, 2011.  Sydling, a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS Alternatives LLC, was formed on August 4, 2011.  UBS Alternatives LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS Americas Inc. In 2015, UBS AG transferred its ownership interest in UBS Americas Inc. to UBS Americas Holding LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS AG which is a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS Group AG.  
     
  Sydling, on behalf of the Fund, has entered into a selling agreement appointing UBS Financial Services Inc. ( UBS Financial Services ) as selling agent to the Fund.  
     
  The Master Fund has entered into a customer agreement appointing UBS Securities LLC ( UBS Securities ) as commodity broker to the Master Fund.  
     
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Fund and the Master Fund amended and restated certain agreements.  The purpose of the amendments was to implement and reflect an expense neutral change in the fees paid to certain service providers to the Fund and the Master Fund.  As of July 1, 2016, the Master Fund (and indirectly the Fund) ceased paying an asset based brokerage fee to UBS Securities.  In lieu of such brokerage fee, the Fund will pay (or cause the Master Fund to pay on its behalf) an ongoing selling agent fee to UBS Financial Services at the same rate as the previous brokerage fee.  
     
  BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. serves as administrator of the Fund (the  Administrator ).  
     
  Winton Capital Management Limited (the  Advisor ) serves as the trading advisor to the Fund and the Master Fund.  
     
  Sydling and each Member share in the profits and losses of the Fund in proportion to the amount of limited liability company interest owned by each except that no Member shall be liable for obligations of the Fund in excess of such member s capital contribution and profits, if any, net of distributions and losses, if any.  
     
  The accompanying financial statements and notes are unaudited and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).  These financial statements present the results of interim periods and do not include all disclosures normally provided in annual financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the Fund s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).  
     
  The preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Sydling to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.

   3.                   Trading Activities  
     
  The Fund was formed for the purpose of trading contracts in a variety of commodity interests, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments.   The Fund invests substantially all of its assets through a  master/feeder  structure. The Fund s pro rata share of the results of the Master Fund s trading activities is shown in the Fund s Statements of Operations and Changes in Members  Capital.  
     
  The customer agreement between the Master Fund and UBS Securities, gives the Master Fund the legal right to net unrealized gains and losses on open futures contracts.  Futures contracts are executed on exchanges and are typically liquidated by entering into offsetting contracts.  The Master Fund nets, for financial reporting purposes, the unrealized gains and losses on open futures contracts on the Master Fund s Statements of Financial Condition.  
     
  All of the commodity interests owned by the Master Fund are held for trading purposes.  The average number of futures contracts traded for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, based on a monthly calculation, was 5,210 and 6,756, respectively.  The average number of futures contracts traded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, based on a monthly calculation, was 5,999 and 5,719, respectively.  
     
  The following tables indicate the gross fair values of derivative instruments of the Master Fund s futures contracts as separate assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

   4.                   Fair Value Measurements  
     
   Fund s Fair Value Measurements  . In May, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-07 ( ASU 2015-07 ),  Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent).  ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per share as a practical expedient. The Fund adopted ASU 2015-07 as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Accordingly, investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per share as a practical expedient have not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy. 
     
  The Fund values investments in the Master Fund, where there are no other rights or obligations inherent within the ownership interest held by the Fund, based on the end of the day net asset value of the Master Fund.  The value of the Fund s investment in the Master Fund reflects its proportional interest in the Master Fund.  As of and for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Fund did not hold any derivative instruments that were based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) or priced at fair value using unobservable inputs through the application of Sydling s assumptions and internal valuation pricing models (Level 3).  
     
   Master Fund s Fair Value Measurements  .  FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820,  Fair Value Measurements  ( ASC 820 ), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Valuation techniques, as specified by ASC 820, are used to measure fair value. 
     
  All financial instruments at fair value are categorized into one of three fair value hierarchy levels, based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the financial instrument s fair value measurement in its entirety:  
     
   Level 1     quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
     
   Level 2     Valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are market observable, either directly or indirectly. 
     
   Level 3     Valuation techniques which include significant inputs that are not based on observable market data. 
     
  Fair value measurement disclosure for each class of assets and liabilities requires greater disaggregation than the Fund s line items in its Statements of Financial Condition.  The Fund determines the appropriate classes for those disclosures on the basis of the nature and risks of the assets and liabilities and their classification in the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3).  
     
  For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, the Master Fund provides quantitative disclosures about the fair value measurements separately for each class of assets and liabilities, as well as a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of Level 3 assets and liabilities broken down by class.  
     
  The Master Fund considers prices for exchange-traded commodity futures and option contracts to be based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1).  As of and for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Master Fund did not hold any derivative instruments for which market quotations were not readily available and which were priced by broker-dealers who derive fair values for these assets from observable inputs (Level 2) or that were priced at fair value using unobservable inputs through the application of Sydling s assumptions and internal valuation pricing models (Level 3).  The gross presentation of the fair value of the Master Fund s derivatives by instrument type is shown in Note 3,  Trading Activities.   
     
  The Master Fund recognizes transfers into and out of the levels indicated above at the end of the reporting period.  During the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no transfers amongst Levels 1, 2 and 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

5.                   Financial Instrument Risks  
     
  In the normal course of business, the Master Fund is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments.  These financial instruments may include futures, forwards and options on futures whose values are based upon an underlying asset, index, or reference rate, and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at specified future dates, or, in the case of derivative commodity instruments, to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash, through physical delivery or with another financial instrument.  These instruments may be traded on an exchange, a swap execution facility ( SEF ), or over-the-counter ( OTC ).  Exchange-traded instruments are standardized and include futures and certain forward and options contracts.  OTC contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include certain forward, option and swap contracts.  Certain swap contracts may also be traded on a SEF. Specific market movements of commodities or futures contracts underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted.  The purchaser of an option may lose the entire premium paid for the option.  The writer, or seller, of an option has unlimited risk.  Each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risk.  In general, the risks associated with OTC contracts are greater than those associated with exchange-traded or SEF traded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an OTC contract.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Master Fund traded futures contracts only.  
     
  The risk to the members that have purchased interests in the Master Fund is limited to the amount of their capital contributions to the Master Fund and their share of the Master Fund s assets and undistributed profits.  This limited liability is a consequence of the organization of the Master Fund as a limited liability company under applicable law.  
     
  Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the Master Fund due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices.  Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded.  The Master Fund is exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.  
     
  Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract.  The Master Fund s risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Statements  
     
 16   

Table of Contents   
     
  of Financial Condition and not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments.  The Master Fund has credit risk and concentration risk because the sole counterparty or broker with respect to the Master Fund s assets is UBS Securities or a UBS affiliate.  Credit risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments is reduced to the extent that through UBS Securities, the Master Fund s counterparty is an exchange or clearing organization.  Futures contracts are conducted through regulated exchanges which have margin requirements, and are settled in cash on a daily basis, thereby minimizing credit risk.  
     
   6.                   Significant Accounting Policies  
     
  The Fund s and the Master Fund s accounting policies are the same and are consistent with the accounting policies in the Fund s financial statements on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
  The Master Fund is an investment company and applies specialized accounting and reporting guidance as outlined in FASB Update 2013-08,  Financial Services   Investment Companies (Topic 946): Amendments to the Scope, Measurement, and Disclosure Requirements ( ASU 2013-08 ).   
     
   Statement of Cash Flows.   The Fund is not required to provide a Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 230   Statement of Cash Flows. 
     
   Investment in Master Fund.   The Fund records its investment in the Master Fund at fair value and is represented by the Fund s proportionate interest in the capital of the Master Fund at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Valuation of securities held by the Master Fund is discussed in the Notes to the Master Fund s financial statements on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The Fund records its pro rata share of the Master Fund s income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains and losses.  The performance of the Fund is directly attributable to the performance of the Master Fund.  The Fund records its subscription and withdrawal of the capital account related to its investment in the Master Fund on the transaction date.   The Master Fund will adjust the capital account of the Fund.  Brokerage, clearing and transaction fees are incurred by the Master Fund and are reflected in the pro rata allocation received by the Fund from the Master Fund. 
     
   Subscriptions Received in Advance.   Subscriptions received in advance represent amounts paid by the non-managing Members for a percentage ownership into the Fund which have not yet been added as Members  capital as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The amount paid is held as cash in the Fund s escrow account and represents the cash on the Fund s Statements of Financial Condition. 
     
   Redemptions Payable.    Pursuant to ASC Topic 480,  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , capital withdrawals effective September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 have been reflected as redemptions payable in the Statements of Financial Condition. 
     
   Income Taxes.   The Fund is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Fund will not pay U.S. federal income tax.  As a result, no income tax liability or expense has been recorded in the financial statements. 
     
  Sydling has analyzed the Master Fund s tax positions for the open tax period and has concluded that no provision is required in the Master Fund s financial statements.  The Master Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in its Statements of Income.  For the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Master Fund did not incur any interest or penalties.  
     
   7.                   Subsequent Events  
     
  Sydling has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Fund through the date of the filing.  Subsequent to September 30, 2016, additional subscriptions were received from the non-managing Members totaling $2,960,100.  Subsequent to September 30, 2016, redemptions of $2,015,498 will be paid to the non-managing Members.  Sydling has determined that there were no additional subsequent events requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.  
     
  After the reporting period the Fund and UBS Financial Services entered into a second amended and restated selling agreement.  The purpose of the amended and restated agreement is to clarify that the Master Fund may pay the selling agent fee on the Fund s behalf.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  The Fund does not engage in sales of goods or services. Its only assets are its investment in the Master Fund, cash and receivables from the Master Fund. The Master Fund does not engage in the sale of goods or services. The Master Fund s only assets are its equity in its trading accounts, consisting of cash, net unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on open futures contracts and interest receivable. Because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading, relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the Fund, through its investment in the Master Fund. While substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred during the third quarter of 2016.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Master Fund s average margin to equity ratio was 10.62 % and 11.14%, respectively.  
     
  The Fund s capital consists of the capital contributions of the Members as increased or decreased by income/(loss) from its investment in the Master Fund and by expenses, interest income, redemptions of Redeemable Units and distributions of profits, if any.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Fund s capital increased 16.45% from $171,511,951 to $199,731,329. This increase was attributable to subscriptions for Redeemable Units totaling $48,182,871, which was partially offset by redemptions of Redeemable Units resulting in an outflow of $16,793,741 coupled with a net loss from operations of $3,169,752. Future redemptions from the Fund could impact the amount of funds available for investment in the Master Fund in subsequent periods.  
     
  The Master Fund s capital consists of the capital contributions of the investors of the Master Fund as increased or decreased by realized and/or unrealized gains or losses on trading and by expenses, interest income, withdrawals of interest from the Master Fund and distributions of profits, if any.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Master Fund s capital increased 16.45% from $171,511,951 to $199,731,329. This increase was attributable to subscriptions for interest in the Master Fund totaling $48,182,871 coupled with net income from operations of $361,546, which was partially offset by the withdrawal of interest in the Master Fund resulting in an outflow of $20,325,039. Future withdrawals from the Master Fund can impact the amount of funds available for investments in commodity contract positions in subsequent periods.  
     
   Critical Accounting Policies   
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Sydling to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Sydling believes that the estimates and assumptions utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Fund s significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 6.  Significant Accounting Policies.   
     
  The Fund records all investments at fair value in its financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains/(losses) and change in net unrealized gains/(losses) in the Statements of Operations and Changes in Members  Capital.  
     
   Results of Operations   
     
  During the Fund s third quarter of 2016, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit decreased 3.5% from $1,233.62 to $1,190.03. The Fund, for its own account, through its investment in the Master Fund, experienced a net trading loss before brokerage fees and related fees in the third quarter of 2016 of $4,503,457. Losses were primarily attributable to the Master Fund s trading of commodity futures in U.S. interest rates, energy, grains, currencies, metals and livestock and were partially offset by gains in indices, non-U.S. interest rates and softs.  
     
  The Fund s performance, through its investment in the Master Fund, declined in the third quarter of 2016 giving back first half gains. Through July, the Master Fund benefited from net long positions in bonds and stock indexes, particularly in the U.S.. However, the Master Fund delivered negative returns in August and September driven by the fixed income, precious metals and energies sectors.  
     
  Hawkish comments from Janet Yellen and Stanley Fischer, the respective chair and vice-chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, increased expectations of a further U.S. rate rise in 2016 and led to losses from long positions in the U.S. government bond and Eurodollar futures, paring their year-to-date contribution to returns. Furthermore, the European Central Bank announced that it had not discussed  
     
 18   

Table of Contents   
     
  extending its quantitative easing program which triggered a market selloff in September. However, the Master Fund earned profits in German government bonds.  
     
  Meanwhile in energies, the price of WTI crude oscillated between $40 and $50 a barrel during the third quarter. The Master Fund s short crude positions suffered as crude oil rallied following OPEC s decision to modestly cut output. Within precious metals, the strengthening in the U.S. dollar weighed on the Master Fund s long position in gold and silver.  
     
  Performance in currencies was driven by long exposure to the Japanese yen, which has now gained nearly 20% against the U.S. dollar since the start of the year after appreciating another 2% during September. The Master Fund made profits in stock indices for the quarter but this was not enough to offset the losses from other sectors. Long positioning in stock indices proved beneficial, particularly in the Hang Seng.  
     
  During the Fund s third quarter of 2015, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit increased by 5.12% from $1,151.32 to $1,210.31. The Fund, for its own account, through its investment in the Master Fund, experienced a net trading gain before brokerage fees and related fees in the third quarter of 2015 of $10,615,238. Gains were primarily attributable to the Master Fund s trading of commodity futures in energy, U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates, metals, currencies, softs and livestock and were partially offset by losses in indices and grains.  
     
  Third quarter of 2015 was profitable for the Fund due to strong gains in July and September.  Most notably the Master Fund delivered gains in a quarter when S P 500 index indices declined 6.9%.  
     
  The Master Fund had strong gains from the energy sector. Crude oil had its biggest drop in almost seven years due to increased OPEC supplies and expectation that lower demand from China would prolong a global glut. U.S. crude stockpiles were almost 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average. During the quarter, Iraq raised its crude output to 3.9 million barrels per day which is significantly more than the previous year s output.  Market participants expected that sanctions on oil exports from Iran, which holds the world s fourth-biggest crude reserves, would be lifted after a nuclear accord on July 14. US WTI Crude oil closed the quarter at $45 per barrel and had declined 24% during the period.  
     
  Gains in equity index sector for the Master Fund came mostly from short positions, most notably in Asian and Emerging market equity indices. Shanghai Composite Index declined 14% in July amid record-high volatility. Continued worsening outlook in China eventually led to sell offs in European and U.S. equity indices in August and September. After coming into the quarter with sizable net long index position, the Master Fund quickly turned flat and eventually maintained a net short posture for the most of September. Most short positions were in China H-Shares, Hang Seng, Kospi and MSCI Emerging Market indices, which were all related to the economic weakness in China.  
     
  The fixed income sector was also profitable, as the Master Fund almost doubled its long positions in Euro Bund, BOBL and Short Sterling futures. The Master Fund also reestablished long positions in U.S. T-note and bond futures after briefly being short in the earlier part of the quarter. U.S. Treasuries benefited as cooling growth in China wiped off trillions from the value of global equities. Also, most European bond yields declined as inflation in the Eurozone dipped into negative territory during the quarter, in spite of ECB s large asset purchase plan that was announced in March.  
     
  By the end of the quarter, most of the risk in the Master Fund was in currencies, equity indices, short term interest rates and bonds sectors. Among notable foreign exchange positions, the Master Fund had short Euro, long British pound, short Canadian dollar and short Australian dollar exposures. Among other notable positions, the Master Fund had short crude oil, short gold and short sugar positions.  
     
  Commodity futures markets are highly volatile. Broad and rapid price fluctuations and rapid inflation increase the risks involved in commodity trading, but also increase the possibility for profit or loss. The profitability of the Fund (and the Master Fund) depends on the existence of major price trends and the ability of the Advisor to correctly identify those price trends.  Price trends are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand relationships, weather, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates. To the extent that market trends exist and the Advisor  is able to identify them, the Fund (and the Master Fund) expects to increase capital through operations. 
     
  Clearing and transaction fees are based on the number of round turns made in the Master Fund s account.  The asset based brokerage fee paid to UBS Securities was calculated as a percentage of the Fund s capital account balance at the Master Fund as of the end of each month.  Clearing and transaction fees of the Master Fund for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $44,684. Brokerage, clearing and transaction fees of the Master Fund for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,487,492, $3,543,180 and $3,977,879, respectively.  The decrease in brokerage, clearing  
     
 19   

Table of Contents   
     
  and transaction fees for the periods ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015 is a result of the change in fees paid to certain service providers to the Fund and Master Fund.  
     
  Ongoing selling agent fees are calculated as a percentage of the Fund s capital account balance at the Master Fund as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions.  
     
  Ongoing selling agent fees of the Fund for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,792,524 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Ongoing selling agent fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,792,524 and $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The ongoing selling agent fee was instituted in the third quarter of 2016.  
     
  Advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of the Fund s adjusted net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions.  
     
  Advisory fees of the Fund for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $765,910 and $618,132, respectively.  The calculation of advisory fees for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 was based on a monthly average net asset value of $204,242,541 and $164,835,090, respectively.  The increase in advisory fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015 is due to an increase in the average net assets.  
     
  Advisory fees of the Fund for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $2,223,247 and $1,652,010, respectively.  The calculation of advisory fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was based on a monthly average net asset value of $197,621,950 and $146,845,339, respectively.  The increase in advisory fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015 is due to an increase in the average net assets.  
     
  Administrative fees are paid to Sydling for administering the business and affairs of the Fund.  Sydling pays a portion of the administrative fee to the Administrator.  These fees are calculated as a percentage of the Fund s adjusted net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions.  
     
  Administrative fees of the Fund for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $255,303 and $206,044, respectively.  The calculation of administrative fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was based on a monthly average net asset value of $204,242,541 and $164,835,090, respectively.  The increase in administrative fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015 is due to an increase in the average net assets.  
     
  Administrative fees of the Fund for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $741,082 and $550,670, respectively.  The calculation of administrative fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was based on a monthly average net asset value of $197,621,950 and $146,845,339, respectively.  The increase in administrative fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015 is due to an increase in the average net assets.  
     
  Incentive fees to the Advisor are based on the new trading profits generated by the Advisor, paid at the end of each quarter, as defined in the Trading Advisory Agreement among  the Master Fund, the Fund, Sydling and the Advisor. There were no incentive fees earned during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Incentive fees of $410,292 and $2,112,137 were earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  In allocating substantially all of the assets of the Fund to the Master Fund, Sydling considers the Advisor s past performance, trading style, volatility of markets traded and fee requirements. Sydling may modify or terminate the allocation of assets to the Advisor at any time.

   Item 3.                          Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    
     
  All of the Fund s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss through its investment in the Master Fund.  
     
  The Master Fund is a speculative commodity pool. The market sensitive instruments held by the Master Fund are acquired for speculative trading purposes, and all or substantially all of the Fund s capital is subject to the risk of trading loss through its investment in the Master Fund. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Master Fund s and the Fund s main line of business.  
     
  The risk to the Members that have purchased Redeemable Units is limited to the amount of their capital contributions to the Fund and their share of Fund assets and undistributed profits.  This limited liability is a consequence of the organization of the Fund as a limited liability company under Delaware law.  
     
  Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair value of the Master Fund s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash balances. The Master Fund s and the Fund s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the Master Fund s open contracts and the liquidity of the markets in which the Master Fund trades.  
     
  The Master Fund rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a range of different markets. Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the Master Fund s past performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results.  
     
   Value at Risk  is a measure of the maximum amount which the Master Fund could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of the Master Fund s speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Master Fund of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated Value at Risk or the Master Fund s experience to date (i.e.,  risk of ruin ). In light of the foregoing, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Master Fund s losses in any market sector will be limited to Value at Risk or by the Master Fund s attempts to manage its market risk.  
     
  Exchange maintenance margin requirements have been used by the Master Fund as the measure of its Value at Risk. Maintenance margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in 95%-99% of any one-day interval. Maintenance margin has been used rather than the more generally available initial margin, because initial margin includes a credit risk component, which is not relevant to Value at Risk.  
     
  Value at Risk tables represent a probabilistic assessment of the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments. The following tables indicate the trading Value at Risk associated with the Master Fund s open positions by market category as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the highest, lowest and average value during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. All open position trading risk exposures of the Master Fund have been included in calculating the figures set forth below. There has been no material change in the trading Value at Risk information previously disclosed in the Fund s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

   Item 4.                          Controls and Procedures    
     
  The Fund s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Fund on the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods expected in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Fund in the reports it files is accumulated and communicated to Sydling, including the President and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) of Sydling, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC filings.  
     
  Sydling is responsible for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures for the Fund s external disclosures.  
     
  Sydling s President and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016 and, based on that evaluation, Sydling s President and CFO have concluded that, at that date, the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  
     
  The Fund s  internal control over financial reporting  is a process under the supervision of Sydling s President and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These controls include policies and procedures that:  
     
                                                pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Fund; 
     
                                                provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and (ii) the Fund s receipts are handled and expenditures are made only pursuant to authorizations of Sydling; and 
     
                                                provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection and correction of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Fund s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
     
  There were no changes in the Fund s  internal control over financial reporting  process during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund s internal control over financial reporting.

   Item 2.          Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were additional subscriptions of 6,553.409 Redeemable Units totaling $8,030,138. The Redeemable Units were issued in reliance upon applicable exemptions from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. These Redeemable Units were purchased by accredited investors as defined in Regulation D. In determining the applicability of the exemption, Sydling relied on the fact that the Redeemable Units were purchased by accredited investors in a private offering.  
     
  Proceeds of net offering were used for the trading of commodity interests, including futures and option contracts.  
     
  The following chart sets forth the purchases of Redeemable Units by the Fund.  

* Generally, Members are permitted to redeem their Redeemable Units as of the end of each month on five business days  notice to Sydling. Under certain circumstances, Sydling can compel redemption, although to date, it has not exercised this right. Purchases of Redeemable Units by the Fund reflected in the chart above were made in the ordinary course of the Fund s business in connection with effecting redemptions for Members.  
  ** Redemptions of Redeemable Units are effected as of the end of each month at the net asset value per Redeemable Unit as of that day.

  Re:                                Appointment as Selling Agent   Amended Terms 
     
  Ladies and Gentlemen:  
     
  We refer to that certain letter dated October 8, 2012 (the  Initial Letter ) appointing UBS Financial Services Inc. ( UBS FS ) as selling agent to Cavendish Futures Fund LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (the  Fund ).  The purpose of this letter is to amend the terms of the Initial Letter to provide for the payment of a selling agent fee to UBS FS.  This letter (the  Selling Agreement ) shall supersede the Initial Letter.  The Fund and UBS FS agree as follows:  
     
  1.                                          Offering . 
     
  The Fund proposes to continue to issue and to sell units of limited liability company interest in the Fund ( Units ) in accordance with its Private Placement Offering Memorandum and Disclosure Document, as amended from time to time (the  Memorandum ).  
     
  2.                                          Sale and Placement of Units . 
     
  (a)                                    Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Fund hereby appoints UBS FS as its non-exclusive selling agent in connection with the sale and placement of Units.  Subject to the performance in all material respects by the Fund of its obligations hereunder, and to the completeness and accuracy in all material respects of all of the representations and warranties of the Fund contained herein, UBS FS hereby accepts such agency and agrees on the terms and conditions herein set forth to accept the authority to seek qualified applicants for Units and to use all reasonable efforts to assist the Fund in obtaining performance by each applicant.  UBS FS shall not have any liability to the Fund in the event that any applicant fails to consummate the purchase of Units.  This provision grants UBS FS authority, in its discretion, and does not imply any obligation to place Units or to seek to place Units. 
     
  (b)                                    The offers and sales of Units are to be effected pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as  
     
 1   

amended (the  Securities Act ), pursuant to Section 4(2) and under Regulation D thereof ( Regulation D ).  Both UBS FS and the Fund have established the following procedures in connection with the offer and sale of Units and agree that neither will make offers or sales of any Units except in compliance with such procedures:  
     
  (i)                                        Offers and sales of Units will be made only in compliance with Regulation D and only to investors that are reasonably believed to qualify as  accredited investors,  as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act. 
     
  (ii)                                     Without the consent of Sydling Futures Management LLC (the  Trading Manager ), no sale of Units to any one investor will be for less than the minimum denominations as may be specified in the Memorandum or as the Fund shall advise UBS FS. 
     
  (iii)                                  No offer or sale of any Units shall be made in any state or jurisdiction, or to any prospective investor located in any state or jurisdiction, where such Units have not been registered or qualified for offer and sale under applicable state securities laws unless such Units are exempt from the registration or qualification requirements of such laws. 
     
  (c)                                     UBS FS is authorized to furnish to prospective purchasers only such information concerning the Fund and the offering as may be contained in the Memorandum or any written supplement thereto, and such other materials as UBS FS has prepared and which comply with applicable laws and regulations. 
     
  3.                                          Subscriptions . 
     
  (a)                                    The Offering Period will continue until the Trading Manager terminates it (the  Continuous Offering ).  Units or partial Units will be sold at Net Asset Value per Unit as of the last day of each month, provided that the Trading Manager may determine to offer no Units in a particular month.  Subject to the performance by the Trading Manager of all of its obligations to be performed under this Selling Agreement and to the completeness and accuracy of all material representations and warranties of the Trading Manager contained in this Selling Agreement, UBS FS hereby accepts such agency. 
     
  (b)                                    All applications for Units and payments by applicants for Units shall be made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Memorandum and the Fund s investor application and subscription agreements. 
     
  (c)                                     All payments received by UBS FS in respect of the Fund s investor application and subscription agreements relating to the Fund shall be handled by UBS FS in accordance with the terms of such investor application and subscription agreements. 
     
 2   

(d)                                    During the Continuous Offering, closings may be held as of the last business day of each month ( Monthly Closings ) for each month the Trading Manager accepts subscriptions. 
     
  (e)                                     A separate escrow account has been opened at Bank of New York Mellon, New York, New York (the  Escrow Agent ) and will be maintained for all funds received from subscribers for Units.  All payments received from persons desiring to purchase Units will be deposited in such account and held in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement entered into with the Escrow Agent. 
     
  4.                                          Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Fund and the Trading Manager . 
     
  The Fund and the Trading Manager jointly and severally represent and warrant to UBS FS, for its benefit, and for the benefit of the purchasers of the Units sold by UBS FS that:  
     
  (a)                                    They will deliver to UBS FS such number of copies of the Memorandum as UBS FS may reasonably request, regardless of whether the Units are offered solely to  accredited investors  as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D.  They will not make any amendment or supplement to the Memorandum until they have given UBS FS a copy thereof and reasonable notice of the same, and no such amendment or supplement, if material, will be made if UBS FS reasonably object thereto. 
     
  (b)                                    The Memorandum complies with Rule 502(b)(2) of Regulation D and the information to be made available or furnished to each purchaser of a Unit pursuant to Section 4(j) hereof or otherwise will be sufficient to comply with Rule 502(b)(2)(iv) and 502(b)(2)(v) of Regulation D. 
     
  (c)                                     All action required under the Fund s limited liability company agreement (the  LLC Agreement ) or otherwise to be taken by the Trading Manager before the subscription for and sale of the Units to subscribers therefor has been taken, or before the Monthly Closing dates will have been taken, and upon (i) payment of the consideration therefor specified in the Fund s investor application and subscription agreement, (ii) acceptance by the Trading Manager of each subscriber acceptable to the Trading Manager, and (iii) the payment of any required filing fee, the subscribers will become members of the Fund ( Members ) entitled to all the rights of Members under the LLC Agreement and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act.  The Units, when sold and paid for as contemplated by the Memorandum, will represent validly authorized and duly issued limited liability company interests in the Fund and will conform to all statements relating thereto contained in the Memorandum, including the LLC Agreement.  The Trading Manager shall maintain records required of a registered commodity pool operator pursuant to the rules of each of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association. 
     
 3   

(d)                                    The Fund has been duly formed and is validly existing as a limited liability company in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware with all requisite power and authority, all necessary authorizations, approvals, orders, licenses, certificates and permits of and from all governmental regulatory officials and bodies, and all necessary rights, licenses and permits from other parties to conduct its business as described in the Memorandum. 
     
  (e)                                     The issue and sale of Units and the execution, delivery and performance of the Fund s obligations under the Memorandum will not result in the violation of any applicable law. 
     
  (f)                                      This Selling Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Fund and, assuming UBS FS  execution hereof, will constitute a valid and binding agreement of the Fund. 
     
  (g)                                     All materials to be given to any potential investor in connection with the offering or placement of Units (all such materials, together with the Memorandum, being referred to herein as the  Offering Material ) will be, as of each Monthly Closing, true, complete and correct in all material respects and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they were made.  The Trading Manager agrees to advise UBS FS immediately of the occurrence of any event or other change which results in the Offering Material containing an untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they were made.  The Fund recognizes and confirms that UBS FS (i) will be using and relying primarily on the information in the Offering Material and information available from generally recognized public sources in performing the services contemplated hereunder without having independently verified the same, (ii) do not assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such information or of the Offering Material and (iii) will not make any appraisal of any assets of the Fund. 
     
  (h)                                    The Fund will apply the proceeds from the sale of the Units for the purposes set forth under  Use of Proceeds  in the Memorandum in substantially the amounts and in the manner indicated thereunder. 
     
  (i)                                        None of the Fund, the Trading Manager nor any person directly or indirectly affiliated with any of them is or will be engaged, as a general partner, sponsor or otherwise (i) in the organization or management of any partnership, fund or other entity, in a manner or under circumstances which, in the opinion of their counsel, will jeopardize the status of the offering of the Units as an exempted transaction under the Securities Act or under the laws of any state in which it is represented by them that the offering may be made, or (ii) in any offering of securities which, when integrated with the offering of the Units in the manner prescribed by Rule 501(a) of Regulation D  
     
 4   

and SEC Release No. 33-4552 (Nov. 6, 1962) will jeopardize the status of the offering of the Units as an exempted transaction under Regulation D.  
     
  (j)                                       Subject to Section 13 hereof, at all times during the Continuous Offering, the Fund and the Trading Manager will (i) make available to each potential purchaser such information (in addition to that contained in the Memorandum) concerning themselves, the offering and any other relevant matters, as they possess or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense, and (ii) provide to each potential purchaser the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from, them concerning the terms and conditions of the offering and the business of the Fund and to obtain any other additional information, to the extent they possess the same or can acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense, necessary to verify the accuracy of the information furnished to the potential purchaser. 
     
  (k)                                    The Trading Manager will provide to each purchaser, if required, the information described in and required to be delivered by Rule 502(b)(2)(iii) and 502(b)(2)(iv). 
     
  (l)                                        Within 15 days of receiving copies from UBS FS of information indicating that subscribers meet the suitability standards, the Trading Manager will approve or reject the subscriptions and notify UBS FS of the same. 
     
  (m)                                The Trading Manager shall file a Form D with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 503 under Regulation D in a timely manner with respect to all subscriptions accepted by the Trading Manager.  The Trading Manager shall comply with any filing requirement imposed by the laws of any state or jurisdiction in which sales are made.  The Trading Manager shall furnish UBS FS and its counsel with copies of all filings made on Form D pursuant hereto. 
     
  (n)                                    The Trading Manager shall notify UBS FS within a reasonable period of time if it engages an additional selling agent for the Fund. 
     
  5.                                          Additional Covenants of the Fund . 
     
  The Fund covenants and agrees with UBS FS as follows:  
     
  (a)                                    UBS FS and its counsel shall be furnished with such documents and opinions as UBS FS and its counsel may require from time to time for the purpose of enabling UBS FS or them to pass upon the issuance and sale of Units as herein contemplated and related proceedings, or to evidence the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Fund and in connection with the issuance and sale of Units as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to UBS FS and its counsel. 
     
 5   

(b)                                    If, at any time after the commencement of the offering of Units and prior to its termination, an event occurs which in the opinion of counsel to the Fund materially affects the Fund and which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Memorandum in order to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they are made, the Trading Manager will notify UBS FS as promptly as practical of the occurrence of such event and prepare and furnish to UBS FS copies of an amendment or supplement to the Memorandum, in such reasonable quantities as UBS FS may request. 
     
  6.                                          Representations and Warranties of the Selling Agent . 
     
  UBS FS represent and warrant that:  
     
  (a)                                    UBS FS is duly authorized to enter into and perform, and has duly executed and delivered, this Selling Agreement and, assuming the Fund s execution hereof, this Selling Agreement will constitute a valid and binding agreement on UBS FS. 
     
  (b)                                    UBS FS has and will maintain all licenses and registrations necessary under applicable law and regulations to provide the services required to be provided by UBS FS hereunder. 
     
  (c)                                     UBS FS has not and will not solicit any offer to buy or offer to sell Units in any manner which would be inconsistent with applicable laws and regulations, or with the procedures for solicitations contemplated by the Memorandum or by any form of general solicitation or advertising, including, but not limited to, any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine or similar medium or broadcast over television or radio, or conduct any seminar or meeting whose attendees have been invited by any general solicitation or advertising or by any other form of general solicitation or general advertising within the meaning of Rule 502(c) of Regulation D. 
     
  (d)                                    Where required by applicable state law or regulation, UBS FS will initiate contact with a prospective offeree only after determining that the suitability and sophistication standards described in the Memorandum are likely to be satisfied with respect to such prospective offeree and, where applicable, only after having obtained an executed investor application and subscription agreement. 
     
  (e)                                     UBS FS will make offers to sell Units to, or solicit offers to subscribe for Units from, persons in only those states or other jurisdictions where the Trading Manager has either qualified or registered the offering for sale or where the Trading Manager has determined that an exemption from such qualification or registration is available under the applicable securities or  blue sky  laws of such states or other jurisdictions.  UBS FS will not offer or sell Units to any person unless, immediately before making such offers or sales, UBS FS reasonably believes such person (i) would be able to represent that such person is acquiring the Units for such person s  
     
 6   

own account as principal for investment and not with a view to resale or distribution, (ii)  qualifies as an accredited investor under Rule 501 of Regulation D (unless otherwise permitted by the Trading Manager) and (iii) meets such other suitability standards as are specified in the Memorandum under the caption  Who May Invest  and the other conditions contained in the Fund s investor application and subscription agreement.  
     
  (f)                                      UBS FS will not offer the Units for sale to, or solicit any offers to subscribe for the Units from, any offeree who resides in a state whose securities or  blue sky  laws require offerees to meet specified qualifications unless such offeree meets such qualifications or which laws require offerees to receive disclosure documents until UBS FS has delivered (or directed the Trading Manager to deliver) the Memorandum, the LLC Agreement, and any other agreement or document that may be attached as an exhibit or appendix referred to in and distributed with the Memorandum or any other information provided by the Trading Manager which is required to be delivered to purchasers pursuant to Rule 502(b)(2) of Regulation D to such offeree, and within a reasonable time prior to the Monthly Closing UBS FS shall deliver (or cause the Trading Manager to deliver) all such documents to all persons who are to purchase the Units, to the extent they have not theretofore received such documents.  In connection with the offering, UBS FS will not represent to any person acquiring Units any material facts relating to the offering unless such facts are contained in the Memorandum or have been provided to UBS FS in writing by the Trading Manager. 
     
  (g)                                     UBS FS will maintain a record of all information obtained by UBS FS indicating that subscribers for Units placed by UBS FS meet the suitability standards referred to in Section 6(e) hereof.  The Trading Manager, in its sole discretion, will approve or reject the subscriptions and notify UBS FS of the same. 
     
  (h)                                    UBS FS is a member in good standing of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. 
     
  (i)                                        UBS FS is in compliance with applicable anti-money laundering laws (including the USA PATRIOT Act) and related regulations and shall be responsible for compliance with such laws and regulations with respect to purchasers of Units. 
     
  (j)                                       UBS FS acknowledges that, in its sole discretion, the Trading Manager may in the future engage additional selling agents for the Fund.  Compensation of any additional selling agents shall be determined by the Trading Manager in its sole discretion. 
     
  (k)                                    UBS FS will furnish each applicant for Units, identified either by UBS FS or the Fund, a copy of the Memorandum and the Fund s investor application and subscription agreement. 
     
 7   

7.                                          Compensation of Selling Agent . 
     
  (a)                                    For its services under this Selling Agreement UBS FS shall receive a fee, payable monthly, equal to an annual rate of 3.50% of the adjusted net assets of the Fund attributable to Units sold by UBS FS (computed monthly by multiplying the adjusted net assets of the Fund attributable to Units sold by UBS FS, by 3.50% and dividing the result thereof by 12) (the  ongoing selling agent fee ).  Adjusted net assets are month-end Net Assets (as defined in the Fund s LLC operating agreement), increased by the current month s management fee, ongoing selling agent fee, incentive fee accrual and other expenses and any redemptions or distributions as of the end of such month.

APPENDIX A  
     
  In connection with the engagement of UBS FS Inc. ( UBSFS ) to advise and assist the Fund with the matters set forth in this Selling Agreement, the Fund hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless UBSFS, its affiliated companies, and each of UBSFS  and such affiliated companies  respective officers, directors, agents, employees and controlling persons (within the meaning of each of Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933) (each of the foregoing, including UBSFS, being hereinafter referred to as an  Indemnified Person ) to the fullest extent permitted by law from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, expenses (including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel), actions (including actions brought by the Fund or the Fund s equity holders or derivative actions brought by any person claiming through the Fund or in the Fund s name), proceedings, arbitrations or investigations (whether formal or informal), or threats thereof (all of the foregoing being hereinafter referred to as  Liabilities ), based upon, relating to or arising out of such engagement or any Indemnified Person s role therein;  provided ,  however , that the Fund shall not be liable under this paragraph:  (a) for any amount paid in settlement of claims without the Fund s consent, unless the Fund s consent is unreasonably withheld, or (b) to the extent that it is finally judicially determined, or expressly stated in an arbitration award, that such Liabilities resulted primarily from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Indemnified Person seeking indemnification.  If multiple claims are brought against any Indemnified Person in an arbitration or other proceeding and at least one such claim is based upon, relates to or arises out of the engagement of UBSFS by the Fund or any Indemnified Person s role therein, the Fund agrees that any award, judgment and other Liabilities resulting therefrom shall be deemed conclusively to be based on, relate to or arise out of the engagement of UBSFS by the Fund or any Indemnified Person s role therein, except to the extent that such award or judgment expressly states that the award or judgment, or any portion thereof, is based solely upon, relates to or arises out of other matters for which indemnification is not available hereunder.  In connection with the Fund s obligation to indemnify for expenses as set forth above, the Fund further agrees to reimburse each Indemnified Person for all such expenses (including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel) as they are incurred by such Indemnified Person;  provided ,  however , that if an Indemnified Person is reimbursed hereunder for any expenses, the amount so paid shall be refunded if and to the extent it is finally judicially determined, or expressly stated in an arbitration award, that the Liabilities in question resulted primarily from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnified Person.  The Fund hereby also agrees that neither UBSFS nor any other Indemnified Person shall have any liability to the Fund (or anyone claiming through the Fund or in the Fund s name) in connection with UBSFS  engagement by the Fund except to the extent that such Indemnified Person has engaged in willful misconduct or been grossly negligent.  
     
  Promptly after UBSFS receives notice of the commencement of any action or other proceeding in respect of which indemnification or reimbursement may be sought hereunder, UBSFS will notify the Fund thereof; but the omission so to notify the Fund    
     
  A- 1   

shall not relieve the Fund from any obligation hereunder unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in the Fund s forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses.  If any such action or other proceeding shall be brought against any Indemnified Person, the Fund shall, upon written notice given reasonably promptly following notice by an Indemnified Person to the Fund of such action or proceeding, be entitled to assume the defense thereof at the Fund s expense with counsel chosen by notice by an Indemnified Person and reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person;  provided ,  however , that any Indemnified Person may at its own expense retain separate counsel to participate in such defense.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ separate counsel at the Fund s expense and to control its own defense of such action or proceeding if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Person, (a) there are or may be legal defenses available to such Indemnified Person or to other Indemnified Persons that are different from or additional to those available to the Fund, or (b) a difference of position or potential difference of position exists between the Fund and such Indemnified Person that would make such separate representation advisable;  provided ,  however , that in no event shall the Fund be required to pay fees and expenses under this indemnity for more than one firm of attorneys (in addition to local counsel) in any jurisdiction in any one legal action or group of related legal actions.  The Fund agrees that the Fund will not, without the prior written consent of UBSFS, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding relating to the matters contemplated by UBSFS  engagement (whether or not any Indemnified Person is a party thereto) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of UBSFS and each other Indemnified Person from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim, action or proceeding.  
     
  If the indemnification of an Indemnified Person provided for hereunder is finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, then the Fund agrees, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person, to contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such Liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the  relative benefits received or sought to be received by the Fund on the one hand and by UBSFS on the other  (as defined in the last sentence of this paragraph).  If the allocation provided in the preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then the Fund agrees to contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such Liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in such preceding sentence but also the relative fault of the Fund and of such Indemnified Person.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the aggregate amount required to be contributed by all Indemnified Persons taking into account the Fund s contributions as described above exceed the amount of the fee actually received by the Trading Manager.  The relative benefits received or sought to be received by the Fund on the one hand and by UBSFS on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (a) the total value of the Units sold by the Fund bears to (b) the fee paid to the Trading Manager.  
     
  A- 2   

The rights accorded to Indemnified Persons hereunder shall be in addition to any rights that any Indemnified Person may have at common law, by separate agreement or otherwise.  If there is more than one indemnitor hereunder, each indemnifying person agrees that its liabilities hereunder shall be joint and several.  Each Indemnified Person is an intended beneficiary hereunder.
