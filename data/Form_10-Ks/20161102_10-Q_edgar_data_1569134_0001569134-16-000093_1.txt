Examples are Keep Whole Processing Contracts and Percent of Proceeds Processing Contracts, as well as pipeline loss allowances on our pipelines. 
  Condensate:   a NGL with a low vapor pressure, mainly composed of propane, butane, pentane and heavier hydrocarbon fractions. 
  Contract barrels:   barrels of crude oil that our customers have contractually agreed to ship in exchange for firm service assurance of capacity and deliverability to delivery points. 
  Delivery point:   any point at which product in a pipeline is delivered to or for the account of a customer. 
  Dry gas:   a gas primarily composed of methane and ethane where heavy hydrocarbons and water either do not exist or have been removed through processing.

  EPA:   the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
  FERC:   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
  Firm fee contracts:   firm fee contracts generally obligate our customers to pay a fixed recurring charge to reserve an agreed upon amount of capacity and/or deliverability on our assets, regardless if the contracted capacity is actually used by the customer. Such contracts are also commonly known as "take-or-pay" contracts.

Generally such liquids consist of propane and heavier hydrocarbons and are commonly referred to as lease condensate, natural gasoline and liquefied petroleum gases. Natural gas liquids include natural gas plant liquids (primarily ethane, propane, butane and isobutane) and lease condensate (primarily pentanes produced from natural gas at lease separators and field facilities). 
  Natural Gas Processing:   the separation of natural gas into pipeline-quality natural gas and a mixed NGL stream.  
  Non-contract barrels (or walk-up barrels):   barrels of crude oil that our customers ship based solely on availability of capacity and deliverability with no assurance of future capacity.

  Play:   a proven geological formation that contains commercial amounts of hydrocarbons. 
  Produced water:   all water removed from a well as a byproduct of the production of hydrocarbons and water removed from a well in connection with operations being conducted on the well, including naturally occurring water in the recovery formation, flow back water recovered during completion and fracturing operations and water entering the recovery formation through water flooding techniques. 
  Receipt point:   the point where a product is received by or into a gathering system, processing facility, or transportation pipeline. 
  Reservoir:   a porous and permeable underground formation containing an individual and separate natural accumulation of producible hydrocarbons (such as crude oil and/or natural gas) which is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is characterized by a single natural pressure system. 
  Residue gas:   the natural gas remaining after being processed or treated. 
  Shale gas:   natural gas produced from organic (black) shale formations.

  Uncommitted shippers (or walk-up shippers):   customers that have not signed long-term shipper contracts and have rights under the FERC tariff as to rates and capacity allocation that are different than long-term committed shippers. 
  Volumetric fee contracts:   volumetric fee contracts generally obligate a customer to pay fees based upon the extent to which such customer utilizes our assets for midstream energy services. Unlike firm fee contracts, under volumetric fee contracts our customers are not generally required to pay a charge to reserve an agreed upon amount of capacity and/or deliverability.  
  Wellhead:   the equipment at the surface of a well that is used to control the well's pressure; also, the point at which the hydrocarbons and water exit the ground. 
  Working gas:   the volume of gas in the storage reservoir that is in addition to the cushion or base gas. It may or may not be completely withdrawn during any particular withdrawal season. Conditions permitting, the total working capacity could be used more than once during any season. 
  Working gas storage capacity:   the maximum volume of natural gas that can be cost-effectively injected into a storage facility and extracted during the normal operation of the storage facility. Effective working gas storage capacity excludes base gas and non-cycling working gas.

2.	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
  Basis of Presentation 
  These condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were prepared in accordance with the accounting principles contained in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification, the single source of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP for annual periods. The condensed consolidated financial statements for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   include all normal, recurring adjustments and disclosures that we believe are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. In this report, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is referred to as the FASB and the FASB Accounting Standards Codification is referred to as the Codification or ASC. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 
  Our financial results for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016. The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ("2015 Form 10-K") filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 17, 2016. 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TEP and its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates. Significant intra-entity items have been eliminated in the presentation. Prior to January 1, 2016, Pony Express participated in a cash management agreement with TD, which currently holds a   2.0%   common membership interest in Pony Express, under which cash balances were swept periodically and recorded as loans from Pony Express to TD. Effective January 1, 2016, Pony Express entered into a cash management agreement with TEP. 
  Net income or loss from consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned by TEP is attributed to TEP and noncontrolling interests. This is done in accordance with substantive profit sharing arrangements, which generally follow the allocation of cash distributions and may not follow the respective ownership percentages held by TEP. Concurrent with TEP's acquisition of an initial   33.3%   membership interest in Pony Express effective September 1, 2014, TEP, TD, and Pony Express entered into the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Agreement of Tallgrass Pony Express Pipeline, LLC ("the Second Amended Pony Express LLC Agreement"), which provided TEP a minimum quarterly preference payment of   $16.65   million (prorated to approximately   $5.4 million   for the quarter ended September 30, 2014) through the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Effective March 1, 2015 with TEP's acquisition of an additional   33.3%   membership interest in Pony Express, the Second Amended Pony Express LLC Agreement was further amended (as amended, "the Pony Express LLC Agreement") to increase the minimum quarterly preference payment to   $36.65 million   (prorated to approximately   $23.5 million   for the quarter ended March 31, 2015) and extend the term of the preference period through the quarter ended December 31, 2015. The Pony Express LLC Agreement provides that the net income or loss of Pony Express be allocated, to the extent possible, consistent with the allocation of Pony Express cash distributions. Under the terms of the Pony Express LLC Agreement, Pony Express distributions and net income for periods beginning after December 31, 2015 are attributed to TEP and its noncontrolling interests in accordance with the respective ownership interests. 
  A variable interest entity ("VIE") is a legal entity that possesses any of the following characteristics: an insufficient amount of equity at risk to finance its activities, equity owners who do not have the power to direct the significant activities of the entity (or have voting rights that are disproportionate to their ownership interest), or equity owners who do not have the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity. Companies are required to consolidate a VIE if they are its primary beneficiary, which is the enterprise that has a variable interest that could be significant to the VIE and the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. We have presented separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, to the extent material, the liabilities of our consolidated VIEs for which creditors do not have recourse to our general credit. Our consolidated VIEs do not have material assets that can only be used to settle specific obligations of the consolidated VIEs. Pony Express was considered to be a VIE under the applicable authoritative guidance prior to our acquisition of an additional   31.3%   membership interest effective January 1, 2016. Effective January 1, 2016, Pony Express is no longer considered to be a VIE. We continue to consolidate our membership interest in Pony Express.

Use of Estimates 
  Certain amounts included in or affecting these condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported for assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses during the reporting period, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods it considers reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. 
  Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  Revenue Recognition 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 provides a comprehensive and converged set of principles-based revenue recognition guidelines which supersede the existing industry and transaction-specific standards. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, entities must apply a five step process to (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 also mandates disclosure of sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The disclosure requirements include qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. 
  Throughout the first half of 2016, the FASB has issued a series of subsequent updates to the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606, including ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, and ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. 
  The amendments in ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, and ASU 2016-12 are effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In light of this recently issued accounting guidance, we have started the process of reviewing our existing revenue contracts. Due to the early stage of this process, we are currently not in a position to estimate the impact the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. We expect to adopt the new standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. This approach allows us to apply the new standard to (i) all new contracts entered into after January 1, 2018 and (ii) all existing contracts as of January 1, 2018 through a cumulative adjustment to equity. Consolidated revenues for periods prior to January 1, 2018 would not be revised. 
  ASU No. 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory" 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. ASU 2015-11 establishes a "lower of cost and net realizable value" model for the measurement of most inventory balances. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. 
  The amendments in ASU 2015-11 are effective for public entities for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-11, but do not anticipate a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 provides a comprehensive update to the lease accounting topic in the Codification intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in ASU 2016-02 include a revised definition of a lease as well as certain scope exceptions. The changes primarily impact lessee accounting, while lessor accounting is largely unchanged from previous GAAP.

The amendments in ASU 2016-02 are effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02. 
  ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Among other changes, ASU 2016-09 allows an entity to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards expected to vest (consistent with current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur.  
  The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for public entities for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-09, but do not anticipate a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 provides explicit guidance on accounting for eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  
  The amendments in ASU 2016-015 are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 
  ASU No. 2015-16, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments" 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. ASU 2015-16 simplifies the accounting for measurement-period adjustments for provisional amounts recognized in a business combination by eliminating the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively account for measurement-period adjustments. Under the updated guidance, the acquirer must recognize adjustments in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined and the effect on earnings as a result of the change to the provisional amounts must be calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. 
  The amendments in ASU 2015-16 are effective for public entities for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 
  ASU No. 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis" 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and other similar legal entities are considered VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and changes certain aspects of the consolidation analysis for reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly for those with fee arrangements and related party relationships. 
  The amendments in ASU 2015-02 are effective for public entities for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.

ASU No. 2014-12, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period" 
  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. ASU 2014-12 provides explicit guidance on accounting for share-based payments requiring a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards when that performance target may be achieved after the requisite service period for the award. The ASU requires that such performance targets be treated as a performance condition, and should not be reflected in the estimate of the grant-date fair value of the award. Instead, compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved. 
  ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 
   
  3.	Acquisitions 
  Acquisition of a   25%   Membership Interest in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC 
  On March 29, 2016, TD's indirect wholly owned subsidiary Rockies Express Holdings, LLC ("REX Holdings") signed a purchase agreement (the "REX Purchase Agreement") with a unit of Sempra U.S. Gas and Power ("Sempra") to acquire Sempra's   25%   membership interest in Rockies Express for cash consideration of   $440 million  , subject to adjustment under the REX Purchase Agreement. 
  On April 28, 2016, we announced that TD offered TEP the right to assume the rights and obligations of REX Holdings under the REX Purchase Agreement. On May 6, 2016, TEP REX Holdings, LLC ("TEP REX"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of TEP, and REX Holdings entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to which REX Holdings assigned to TEP REX all of its rights under the REX Purchase Agreement and, in exchange, TEP REX assumed all of the rights and obligations of REX Holdings under the REX Purchase Agreement. Subsequently on May 6, 2016, TEP REX closed the purchase of a   25%   membership interest in Rockies Express from Sempra pursuant to the REX Purchase Agreement for cash consideration of approximately   $436.0 million  , after making the adjustments to the purchase price required by the REX Purchase Agreement. 
  Our investment in Rockies Express is recorded under the equity method of accounting and reported as "Unconsolidated investment" on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of May 6, 2016, the difference between the fair value of our investment in Rockies Express of   $436.0 million   and the book value of the underlying net assets of approximately   $840.7 million   results in a negative basis difference of approximately   $404.7 million  . The basis difference has been allocated to property, plant and equipment and long-term debt based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The amount of the basis difference allocated to property, plant and equipment is accreted over   35 years  , which equates to the   2.86%   composite depreciation rate utilized by Rockies Express to depreciate the underlying property, plant and equipment. The amount allocated to long-term debt is amortized over the remaining life of the various debt facilities. The basis difference at   September 30, 2016   was allocated as follows: 

During the period from May 6, 2016 to   September 30, 2016  , we recognized equity in earnings from Rockies Express of   $35.4 million  , inclusive of the amortization of the negative basis difference discussed above, and received distributions from and made contributions to Rockies Express of   $51.5 million   and   $35.5 million  , respectively.

Summarized financial information for Rockies Express is as follows:  

Acquisition of Additional   31.3%   Membership Interest in Pony Express 
  Effective January 1, 2016, TEP acquired an additional   31.3%   membership interest in Pony Express in exchange for cash consideration of   $475 million   and   6,518,000   TEP common units (valued at approximately   $268.6 million   based on the December 31, 2015 closing price of our common units) issued to TD, for total consideration of approximately   $743.6 million  . The transaction increased our aggregate membership interest in Pony Express to   98.0%  . As part of the transaction, TD granted us an   18   month call option covering the newly issued   6,518,000   common units at a price of   $42.50  . On the effective date of the acquisition, the call option was valued at   $46.0 million  . As discussed in   Note 8       Risk Management  ,   on July 21, 2016, we partially exercised the option covering   3,563,146   of the common units. On October 31, 2016, we partially exercised the option covering   1,251,760   of the common units, leaving   1,703,094   remaining common units subject to the call option as of   November 2, 2016  . As a result of the partial exercise on July 21, 2016, TEP derecognized a portion of the derivative asset balance, recognizing approximately   $25.9 million   through equity during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as discussed further in   Note 10       Partnership Equity and Distributions  . 
  The acquisition of the additional   31.3%   membership interest in Pony Express represents a transaction between entities under common control and an acquisition of noncontrolling interests. As a result, financial information for periods prior to the transaction has not been recast to reflect the additional   31.3%   membership interest. The transaction resulted in a deemed distribution to our general partner as discussed further in   Note 10       Partnership Equity and Distributions  . 
  Cash outflows to acquire an additional noncontrolling interest in Pony Express are classified as an investing activity in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows to the extent the consideration paid was used to directly fund the construction of the underlying assets by the noncontrolling member. Cash outflows to acquire an additional noncontrolling interest in excess of the cost to construct the underlying assets are classified as financing activities. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   $49.1 million   of the   $475 million   paid to acquire the additional   31.3%   membership interest in Pony Express was classified as an investing activity and   $425.9 million   was classified as a financing activity. 
  TEP Acquisition of BNN Western, LLC 
  On December 16, 2015, Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation ("Whiting"), BNN Redtail, LLC ("Redtail"), and BNN Western, LLC ("Western"), a newly formed Delaware limited liability company, entered into a definitive Transfer, Purchase and Sale Agreement, pursuant to which Redtail acquired   100%   of the outstanding membership interests of Western from Whiting in exchange for total cash consideration of   $75 million  . Western's assets consist of a fresh water delivery and storage system and produced water gathering and produced water disposal system, which together comprise   62   miles of pipeline along with associated fresh water ponds and disposal wells. As part of the transaction with Whiting, Whiting also executed a   five  -year fresh water service contract and a   nine  -year gathering and disposal contract.  
  At December 31, 2015, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition were recorded at provisional amounts based on the preliminary purchase price allocation. The   $75 million   purchase price of the assets was allocated entirely to property, plant and equipment. No adjustments were made to these provisional amounts and the allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition was considered final as of September 30, 2016.  
  
   11 

TEP's unaudited pro forma revenue and net income attributable to partners for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   is presented below as if the acquisition of Western had been completed on January 1, 2015: 

The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations or financial position of TEP would have been if the transactions had in fact occurred on the date or for the period indicated, nor do they purport to project the results of operations or financial position of TEP for any future periods or as of any date. The pro forma financial information does not give effect to any cost savings, operating synergies, or revenue enhancements expected to result from the transactions or the costs to achieve these cost savings, operating synergies, and revenue enhancements. The pro forma revenue and net income includes adjustments to give effect to TEP's consolidated interest in the estimated results of operations of Western for the periods presented. 
  Acquisition of Additional Membership Interest in Water Solutions 
  On July 1, 2016, we acquired the remaining   8%   noncontrolling equity interest in Water Solutions and additional interests in certain of Water Solutions' subsidiaries from Regency Investments I, LLC and BSEG Water Group LLC for total cash consideration of   $6.0 million  , which will be accounted for as an acquisition of noncontrolling interest. Subsequent to the closing of the transaction, our aggregate membership interest in Water Solutions is   100%  . 
   
  4.	Related Party Transactions    
  We have no employees. TD, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Tallgrass Operations, LLC ("Tallgrass Operations"), provided and charged us for direct and indirect costs of services provided to us or incurred on our behalf including employee labor costs, information technology services, employee health and retirement benefits, and all other expenses necessary or appropriate to the conduct of our business. We recorded these costs on the accrual basis in the period in which TD incurred them. On May 17, 2013, in connection with the closing of TEP's initial public offering, TEP and its general partner entered into an Omnibus Agreement with TD and certain of its affiliates, including Tallgrass Operations (the "TEP Omnibus Agreement"). The TEP Omnibus Agreement provides that, among other things, TEP will reimburse TD and its affiliates for all expenses they incur and payments they make on TEP's behalf, including the costs of employee and director compensation and benefits as well as the cost of the provision of certain centralized corporate functions performed by TD, including legal, accounting, cash management, insurance administration and claims processing, risk management, health, safety and environmental, information technology and human resources in each case to the extent reasonably allocable to TEP. 
  There was no interest income from TD recognized for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   we recognized interest income from TD of   $0.4 million   on the receivable balance under the Pony Express cash management agreement in effect through December 31, 2015. 
  Transactions with affiliated companies, excluding transactions otherwise disclosed, are as follows:

7.	Goodwill    
  Annual Goodwill Impairment Analysis 
  We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation for impairment. Examples of such facts and circumstances include changes in the magnitude of the excess of fair value over carrying amount in the last valuation or changes in the business environment. Our annual impairment testing date is August 31. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment as defined in the segment reporting guidance of the Codification, using either the qualitative assessment option or the two-step test approach depending on facts and circumstances of the reporting unit. If we, after performing the qualitative assessment, determine it is  more likely than not  that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. When goodwill is evaluated for impairment using the two-step test, the carrying amount of the reporting unit is compared to its fair value in Step 1 and if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, Step 2 is unnecessary. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, this could indicate potential impairment and Step 2 of the goodwill evaluation process is required to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any. When Step 2 is necessary, the fair value of individual assets and liabilities is determined using valuations, or other observable sources of fair value, as appropriate. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the excess is recognized as an impairment loss. 
  We did not elect to apply the qualitative assessment option during our 2016 annual goodwill impairment testing; instead we proceeded directly to the two-step quantitative test. In Step 1 of the two-step quantitative test, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective book value, including goodwill, by using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow analysis. For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, goodwill was allocated to our reporting units based on the enterprise value of each reporting unit at the date of acquisition. The fair value of each reporting unit was determined on a stand-alone basis from the perspective of a market participant and included a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in various assumptions. This approach required us to make long-term forecasts of future operating results and various other assumptions and estimates, the most significant of which are gross margin, operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, long-term growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital. The fair value of the reporting units was determined using significant unobservable inputs, considered Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in the Codification. For each reporting unit, the results of the Step 1 impairment analysis indicated no potential impairment as the fair value of the reporting units was greater than their respective book values. As a result, in accordance with the Codification guidance, Step 2 of the impairment analysis was not necessary as part of the annual impairment analysis in 2016. Unpredictable events or deteriorating market or operating conditions could result in a future change to the discounted cash flow models and cause impairments in the future. We continue to monitor potential impairment indicators to determine if a triggering event occurs and will perform additional goodwill impairment analyses as necessary. 
   
  8.	Risk Management 
  We occasionally enter into derivative contracts with third parties for the purpose of hedging exposures that accompany our normal business activities. Our normal business activities directly and indirectly expose us to risks associated with changes in the market price of crude oil and natural gas, among other commodities. For example, the risks associated with changes in the market price of crude oil and natural gas include, among others (i) pre-existing or anticipated physical crude oil and natural gas sales, (ii) natural gas purchases and (iii) natural gas system use and storage. We have elected not to apply hedge accounting and changes in the fair value of all derivative contracts are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. 
  
   14 

Fair Value of Derivative Contracts 
  The following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative contracts included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets: 

(1)   
    As discussed in   Note 3       Acquisitions  , in conjunction with our acquisition of an additional   31.3%   membership interest in Pony Express effective January 1, 2016, TD granted us an   18   month call option covering the   6,518,000   common units issued to TD. 
               (2)   
    As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value shown for natural gas derivative contracts was comprised of derivative volumes for short natural gas fixed-price swaps totaling   0.8   Bcf. As of   December 31, 2015   there were no natural gas derivative contracts outstanding. 
      Effect of Derivative Contracts in the Statements of Income  
  The following table summarizes the impact of derivative contracts for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Exercise of Call Option 
  On July 21, 2016, we partially exercised the call option granted by TD in January 2016 as discussed in   Note 3       Acquisitions   covering   3,563,146   common units for a cash payment of   $151.4 million  . On October 31, 2016, we partially exercised the call option again covering an additional   1,251,760   common units for a cash payment of   $53.2 million  . These common units were deemed canceled upon the exercise of the call option and as of such exercise date were no longer issued and outstanding. As of   November 2, 2016  ,   1,703,094   common units remained subject to the call option. 
  Credit Risk 
  We have counterparty credit risk as a result of our use of derivative contracts. Counterparties to our crude oil and natural gas derivatives consist of major financial institutions. This concentration of counterparties may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. The counterparty to our call option derivative is TD.  
  
   15 

Our over-the-counter swaps are entered into with counterparties outside central trading organizations such as futures, options or stock exchanges. These contracts are with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. While we enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings, it is nevertheless possible that from time to time losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts were a liability, resulting in no credit exposure from TEP's counterparties as of that date. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any outstanding letters of credit or cash in margin accounts in support of our hedging of commodity price risks associated with the sale of natural gas nor did we have any margin deposits with counterparties associated with natural gas contract positions. 
  Fair Value 
  Derivative assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or over-the-counter ("OTC"). Exchange-traded derivative contracts typically fall within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy if they are traded in an active market. We value exchange-traded derivative contracts using quoted market prices for identical securities. 
  OTC commodity derivatives are valued using models utilizing a variety of inputs including contractual terms and commodity and interest rate curves. The selection of a particular model and particular inputs to value an OTC derivative contract depends upon the contractual terms of the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. We use similar models to value similar instruments. For OTC derivative contracts that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards and swaps, model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. Such contracts are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The call option granted by TD is valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Key inputs to the valuation model include the term of the option, risk free rate, the exercise price and current market price, expected volatility and expected distribution yield of the underlying units. The call option valuation is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the value is based on significant observable inputs. 
  Certain OTC derivative contracts trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information; as such, the determination of fair value for these derivative contracts is inherently more difficult. Such contracts are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The valuations of these less liquid OTC derivatives are typically impacted by Level 1 and/or Level 2 inputs that can be observed in the market, as well as unobservable Level 3 inputs. Use of a different valuation model or different valuation input values could produce a significantly different estimate of fair value. However, derivative contracts valued using inputs unobservable in active markets are generally not material to our financial statements. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors including credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used.

  Long-term debt consisted of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(1)   
    Deferred financing costs, net as presented above relate solely to the 2024 Notes. Deferred financing costs associated with our revolving credit facility are presented in noncurrent assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
     Senior Unsecured Notes 
  On September 1, 2016, TEP and Tallgrass Energy Finance Corp. (the "Co-Issuer" and together with TEP, the "Issuers"), the Guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank, National Association, as trustee, entered into an Indenture dated September 1, 2016 (the "Indenture"), pursuant to which the Issuers issued   $400 million   in aggregate principal amount of   5.50%   senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes"). TEP used the net proceeds of the offering to repay outstanding borrowings under its existing senior secured revolving credit facility. 
  The 2024 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Issuers. The 2024 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior unsecured basis by TEP's existing direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer) and certain of TEP's future subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). The 2024 Notes rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuers, and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuers. The 2024 Notes will mature on September 15, 2024 and interest on the 2024 Notes is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on each March 15 and September 15, commencing March 15, 2017. TEP may redeem the 2024 Notes prior to their scheduled maturity at the applicable redemption price set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
  
   17 

The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit TEP's ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred units; (ii) create liens to secure indebtedness; (iii) pay distributions on equity interests, repurchase equity securities or redeem subordinated securities; (iv) make investments; (v) restrict distributions, loans or other asset transfers from TEP's restricted subsidiaries; (vi) consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of TEP's properties to, another person; (vii) sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including equity interests in subsidiaries; and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. As of   September 30, 2016  , we are in compliance with the covenants required under the 2024 Notes. 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  Effective January 4, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of an additional   31.3%   membership interest in Pony Express, TEP exercised the committed accordion feature to increase the total capacity of the revolving credit facility from   $1.1 billion   to   $1.5 billion  . In connection with the acquisition of a   25%   membership interest in Rockies Express, TEP amended the revolving credit facility to increase the total capacity to   $1.75 billion  , which increase became effective May 6, 2016. 
  The following table sets forth the available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The revolving credit facility contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability (as well as the ability of our restricted subsidiaries) to incur or guarantee additional debt, incur certain liens on assets, dispose of assets, make certain distributions (including distributions from available cash, if a default or event of default under the credit agreement then exists or would result from making such a distribution), change the nature of our business, engage in certain mergers or make certain investments and acquisitions, enter into non-arms-length transactions with affiliates and designate certain subsidiaries as "Unrestricted Subsidiaries." In addition, we are required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than   4.75   to 1.00 (which will be increased to   5.25   to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions) and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than   2.50   to 1.00. As of   September 30, 2016  , we are in compliance with the covenants required under the revolving credit facility. 
  The unused portion of the revolving credit facility is subject to a commitment fee, which ranges from   0.300%   to   0.500%  , based on our total leverage ratio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was   2.28%  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our weighted average effective interest rate, including the interest on outstanding borrowings, commitment fees, and amortization of deferred financing costs, was   2.72%  . 
  Fair Value 
  The following table sets forth the carrying amount and fair value of our long-term debt, which is not measured at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , but for which fair value is disclosed: 

18 

The long-term debt borrowed under the revolving credit facility is carried at amortized cost. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of borrowings under the revolving credit facility approximates the carrying amount of the borrowings using a discounted cash flow analysis. The 2024 Notes are carried at amortized cost, net of deferred financing costs. The estimated fair value of the 2024 Notes is based upon quoted market prices adjusted for illiquid markets. 
  We are not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value subsequent to   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  10.	Partnership Equity and Distributions    
  Equity Distribution Agreements 
  On October 31, 2014, we entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which we may sell from time to time through a group of managers, as our sales agents, common units representing limited partner interests having an aggregate offering price of up to   $200 million  . On May 13, 2015 the amount was subsequently amended to   $100.2 million   in order to account for follow-on equity offerings under our S-3 shelf registration statement. On May 17, 2016, we entered into a new equity distribution agreement allowing for the sale of common units with an aggregate offering price of up to   $657.5 million  . Sales of common units, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions, to or through a market maker or directly on or through an electronic communication network, a "dark pool" or any similar market venue, or as otherwise agreed by the Partnership and one or more of the managers. We intend to use the net cash proceeds from any sale of the units for general partnership purposes, which may include, among other things, the Partnership's exercise of the call option with respect to the   6,518,000   common units issued to TD in connection with the Partnership's acquisition of an additional   31.3%   of Pony Express in January 2016, repayment or refinancing of debt, funding for acquisitions, capital expenditures and additions to working capital.  
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued and sold   622,846   common units with a weighted average sales price of   $47.39   per unit under our equity distribution agreements for net cash proceeds of approximately   $28.7 million   (net of approximately   $0.8 million   in commissions and professional service expenses). During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we issued and sold   6,703,984   common units with a weighted average sales price of   $43.98   per unit under our equity distribution agreements for net cash proceeds of approximately   $290.5 million   (net of approximately   $4.4 million   in commissions and professional service expenses). During the period from October 1, 2016 to November 2, 2016, we issued and sold an additional   628,914   common units with a weighted average sales price of   $48.05   per unit under our equity distribution agreement for net cash proceeds of approximately   $29.9 million   (net of approximately   $0.3 million   in commissions and professional service expenses). We used the net cash proceeds for general partnership purposes as described above. 
  Private Placement 
  On April 28, 2016, we issued an aggregate of   2,416,987   common units for net cash proceeds of   $90.0 million   in a private placement transaction to certain funds managed by Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C. The units were subsequently registered pursuant to our Form S-3/A (File No. 333-210976) filed with the SEC on May 6, 2016, which became effective May 17, 2016. 
  Tallgrass Development Purchase Program  
  On February 17, 2016, TEP and Tallgrass Energy GP, LP ("TEGP") announced that the Board of Directors of Tallgrass Energy Holdings, LLC, the sole member of TEGP's general partner and the general partner of TD, has authorized an equity purchase program under which TD may initially purchase up to an aggregate of   $100 million   of the outstanding Class A shares of TEGP or the outstanding common units of TEP. TD may purchase Class A shares or Common Units from time to time on the open market or in negotiated purchases. The timing and amounts of any such purchases will be subject to market conditions and other factors, and will be in accordance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements. The purchase plan does not obligate TD to acquire any specific number of Class A shares or Common Units and may be discontinued at any time. No purchases were made under this program during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

Distributions to Holders of Common Units, General Partner Units and Incentive Distribution Rights 
  Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute our available cash, as defined in the partnership agreement, to unitholders of record on the applicable record date within 45 days after the end of each quarter. The following table shows the distributions for the periods indicated: 

Other Contributions and Distributions 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , TEP was deemed to have made noncash capital distributions of   $280.0 million   and   $25.9 million   to the general partner, which represent the excess purchase price over the carrying value of the additional   31.3%   membership interest in Pony Express acquired effective January 1, 2016 and the derecognition of a portion of the derivative asset associated with the partial exercise of the call option, respectively. See   Note 3       Acquisitions   for additional information regarding these transactions. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , TEP also received contributions of   $5.3 million   from TD to indemnify TEP for costs associated with Trailblazer's Pipeline Integrity Management Program, as discussed in   Note 13       Legal and Environmental Matters  , and received contributions and distributions from noncontrolling interests of   $8.7 million   and   $5.0 million  , which primarily consisted of activity associated with TD's   2%   noncontrolling interest in Pony Express.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , TEP was deemed to have made a noncash capital distribution of   $324.3 million   to the general partner, which represents the excess purchase price over the carrying value of the additional   33.3%   membership interest in Pony Express acquired effective March 1, 2015. TEP also recognized contributions from noncontrolling interests of   $110.6 million  , which consisted primarily of contributions from TD to Pony Express to fund construction of the lateral in Northeast Colorado, and distributions to noncontrolling interests of   $44.5 million  . 
   
  11.	Net Income per Limited Partner Unit    
  The Partnership's net income is allocated to the general partner and the limited partners, including the holders of the subordinated units, in accordance with their respective ownership percentages, after giving effect to incentive distributions paid to the general partner. Basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit is calculated by dividing limited partners' interest in net income, less general partner incentive distributions, by the weighted average number of outstanding limited partner units during the period.  
  We compute earnings per unit using the two-class method for Master Limited Partnerships as prescribed in the FASB guidance. The two-class method requires that securities that meet the definition of a participating security be considered for inclusion in the computation of basic earnings per unit. Under the two-class method, earnings per unit is calculated as if all of the earnings for the period were distributed under the terms of the partnership agreement, regardless of whether the general partner has discretion over the amount of distributions to be made in any particular period, whether those earnings would actually be distributed during a particular period from an economic or practical perspective, or whether the general partner has other legal or contractual limitations on its ability to pay distributions that would prevent it from distributing all of the earnings for a particular period. 
  We calculate net income available to limited partners based on the distributions pertaining to the current period's net income. After adjusting for the appropriate period's distributions, the remaining undistributed earnings or excess distributions over earnings, if any, are allocated to the general partner and limited partners in accordance with the contractual terms of the partnership agreement and as further prescribed in the FASB guidance under the two-class method. 
  The two-class method does not impact our overall net income or other financial results; however, in periods in which aggregate net income exceeds our aggregate distributions for such period, it will have the impact of reducing net income per limited partner unit. This result occurs as a larger portion of our aggregate earnings, as if distributed, is allocated to the incentive distribution rights (which are currently held by our general partner), even though we make distributions on the basis of available cash and not earnings. In periods in which our aggregate net income does not exceed our aggregate distributions for such period, the two-class method does not have any impact on our calculation of earnings per limited partner unit. 
  Basic earnings per unit is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to unitholders by the weighted average number of units outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per unit reflects the potential dilution of common equivalent units that could occur if equity participation units are converted into common units. 
  The following table illustrates the Partnership's calculation of net income per common and subordinated unit for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

12.	Regulatory Matters    
  There are currently no proceedings challenging the currently effective transportation rates of Pony Express, Rockies Express or Trailblazer Pipeline Company LLC ("Trailblazer"). On October 30, 2015, Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission, LLC ("TIGT") filed a general rate case with the FERC pursuant to Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act ("NGA"), discussed in more detail below. Regulators, as well as shippers, do have rights, under circumstances prescribed by applicable law, to challenge the rates that we charge at our regulated entities. Further, applicable law governing service by Pony Express allows parties having standing to file complaints in regard to existing tariff rates and provisions. If the complaint is not resolved, the FERC may conduct a hearing and order a crude oil pipeline like the Pony Express System to make reparations going back for up to two years prior to the date on which a complaint was filed if a rate is found to be unjust and unreasonable. We can provide no assurance that current rates will remain unchallenged. Any successful challenge could have a material, adverse effect on our future earnings and cash flows.

TIGT 
  General Rate Case Filing   FERC Docket RP16-137 
  On October 30, 2015, TIGT filed a general rate case with the FERC pursuant to Section 4 of the NGA. The rate case proposed a general system-wide increase in the maximum tariff rates for all firm and interruptible services offered by TIGT. In addition, TIGT proposed certain changes to the transportation rate design of its system to replace the current rate zone structure with a single "postage stamp" rate. TIGT also proposed new incremental charges, including (i) a charge for deliveries made to points without certain electronic flow measurement equipment, and (ii) a Cost Recovery Mechanism ("CRM") charge to completely or partially reimburse TIGT for certain costs it incurred to maintain system safety, environmental compliance and reliability. TIGT also proposed to replace its fixed fuel and lost and unaccounted for ("FL U") charge with a FL U tracker that would compensate TIGT for its actual FL U expenses and adjust each year to reflect the previous period's under/over collection and the forecasted FL U expense for the upcoming period. TIGT also proposed to implement a power cost tracker to recover the actual power costs incurred by TIGT to power its compressors. Finally, TIGT proposed certain revisions to its FERC Gas Tariff addressing a number of other rate and non-rate matters. Under the NGA and the FERC's regulations, TIGT's shippers and other interested parties, including the FERC's Trial Staff, had a right to challenge any aspect of TIGT's rate case filing. Accordingly, numerous TIGT customers protested aspects of TIGT's NGA Section 4 rate filing.  
  On November 30, 2015, the FERC issued an order accepting and suspending the proposed rates and certain proposed tariff records to be effective upon motion May 1, 2016, subject to refund, certain modifications to TIGT's proposed CRM charge, and the outcome of an evidentiary hearing before a FERC Administrative Law Judge (the "Suspension Order"). In the Suspension Order, the FERC also accepted two tariff records related to force majeure events and reservation charge crediting to be effective December 1, 2015, subject to certain modifications. On December 21, 2015, TIGT made a compliance filing with the FERC to modify TIGT's proposed CRM charge and update the tariff records related to force majeure events and reservation charge crediting as directed by the FERC in the Suspension Order. No comments or protests were filed in response to the compliance filing and the FERC accepted the compliance filing on February 1, 2016. On March 22, 2016, a Settlement Judge was appointed in the case to assist the participants in exploring the possibility of settlement. On March 31, 2016, the FERC issued an order denying certain rehearing requests concerning the CRM, granting in part a motion to remove certain pro forma tariff records from the hearing, and also requested comments in order to assess the need for a technical conference. The FERC also retained for resolution through hearing the pro forma tariff records related to TIGT's proposed charge at delivery points lacking electronic flow measurement and removed from hearing the other issues related to the pro forma tariff records. Whether any issues will be resolved through technical conference is pending. The FERC also directed TIGT to provide additional information related to certain pro forma tariff records, which TIGT filed on April 14, 2016. On June 23, 2016, the FERC approved the implementation of TIGT's filed postage stamp rates, subject to refund, effective on May 1, 2016. 
  TIGT has reached an agreement in principle with customers representing a majority of firm fee revenue on the TIGT System for the year ended December 31, 2015 to settle all rate related issues set for hearing in its existing FERC rate case, including the issues of a cost recovery mechanism and a non-Electronic Flow Measurement charge. On May 5, 2016, the Acting Chief Administrative Law Judge issued an Order suspending the procedural schedule in the case as a result of the agreement in principle. On June 8, 2016, TIGT filed with the FERC its offer of settlement which resolves all issues in the case, with the exception of certain non-rate related tariff issues which remain subject to the FERC's review and approval. On June 9, 2016, the Presiding Administrative Law Judge issued an Order shortening the period for any comments on the settlement, such that comments were due by June 13, 2016. No adverse comments were filed. The offer of settlement was certified to the FERC by the Administrative Law Judge on July 14, 2016. The Judge found that the settlement is uncontested, presents no issues of first impression, has no FERC policy implications, and appears to be just, reasonable, and in the public interest. The FERC issued an order on November 2, 2016 approving the settlement, finding that it appears to be fair and reasonable and in the public interest.  
  Trailblazer 
  2016 Annual Fuel Tracker Filing   FERC Docket Nos. RP16-814-000 and RP16-814-001 
  On April 1, 2016, Trailblazer made its annual fuel tracker filing with a proposed effective date of May 1, 2016 in Docket No. RP16-814-000. The FERC accepted this filing on April 18, 2016. On May 19, 2016, Trailblazer filed its refund report associated with the April 1, 2016 annual fuel tracker filing, which the FERC accepted on July 11, 2016. 
  On September 7, 2016, Trailblazer filed an adjustment to its April 1, 2016 fuel tracker filing. As a result of this adjustment, Trailblazer proposed to issue additional cash-out refunds to applicable shippers and also reflect this adjustment in its applicable fuel accounts. The FERC accepted this filing on October 3, 2016. On October 14, 2016, Trailblazer filed its refund report associated with its September 7, 2016 adjustment filing.

Rockies Express 
  Annual FERC Fuel Tracking Filings   FERC Docket Nos. RP16-702-000 and RP16-1301-000 
  On March 1, 2016, Rockies Express made its annual fuel tracker filing with a proposed effective date of April 1, 2016 in Docket No. RP16-702. The FERC issued an order accepting the filing on March 25, 2016. 
  On September 30, 2016, Rockies Express elected to make an interim fuel tracker filing with a proposed effective date of November 1, 2016 in Docket No. RP16-1301-000. This interim filing proposes increases to most applicable fuel and power rates as a result of increased system utilization. On October 12, 2016, certain shippers filed a protest with the FERC regarding the proposed increases. Rockies Express filed a response to the protest on October 20, 2016, to which the shippers replied on October 25, 2016. On October 20, 2016, Rockies Express also filed an errata to rates applicable to a pooling and wheeling service. The FERC set a November 1, 2016 comment deadline on the errata filing. The interim filing remains pending before the FERC. 
  Seneca Lateral Facilities Conversion   FERC Docket No. CP15-102-000  
  On March 2, 2015 in Docket No. CP15-102-000, Rockies Express filed with the FERC an application for (1) authorization to convert certain existing and operating pipeline and compression facilities located in Noble and Monroe Counties, Ohio (Seneca Lateral Facilities described in Docket Nos. CP13-539-000 and CP14-194-000) from Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 Section 311 authority to Natural Gas Act Section 7 jurisdiction, and (2) issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing Rockies Express to operate and maintain the Seneca Lateral Facilities. On April 7, 2016, the FERC issued a Certificate to Rockies Express granting its requested authorizations. As directed by the FERC, Rockies Express filed revised rates for Natural Gas Act service on the Seneca Lateral, and the Seneca Lateral commenced Natural Gas Act service on June 1, 2016. 
  Rockies Express Zone 3 Capacity Enhancement Project   FERC Docket No. CP15-137-000 
  On March 31, 2015 in Docket No. CP15-137-000, Rockies Express filed with the FERC an application for authorization to construct and operate (1) three new mainline compressor stations located in Pickaway and Fayette Counties, Ohio and Decatur County, Indiana; (2) additional compressors at an existing compressor station in Muskingum County, Ohio; and (3) certain ancillary facilities. The proposed facilities will increase the Rockies Express Zone 3 east-to-west mainline capacity by   800,000   Dth/d from receipts at Clarington, Ohio to corresponding deliveries of   520,000   Dth/d and   280,000   Dth/d to Lebanon, Ohio and Moultrie County, Illinois, respectively. Pursuant to the FERC's obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act, FERC staff issued an Environmental Assessment for the project on August 31, 2015. On February 25, 2016, the FERC issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity authorizing Rockies Express to proceed with the project. On March 14, 2016, Rockies Express commenced construction of the project facilities. 
   
  13.	Legal and Environmental Matters    
  Legal 
  In addition to the matters discussed below, we are a defendant in various lawsuits arising from the day-to-day operations of our business. Although no assurance can be given, we believe, based on our experiences to date, that the ultimate resolution of such routine items will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We have evaluated claims in accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies that we deem both probable and reasonably estimable and, accordingly, had no reserve for legal claims as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  Rockies Express 
  Mineral Management Service Lawsuit  
  On June 30, 2009, Rockies Express filed claims against Mineral Management Service, a former unit of the U.S. Department of Interior (collectively "Interior") for breach of its contractual obligation to sign transportation service agreements for pipeline capacity that it had agreed to take on Rockies Express. The Civilian Board of Contract Appeals ("CBCA") conducted a trial and ruled that Interior was liable for breach of contract, but limited the damages Interior was required to pay. On September 13, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision affirming that Interior was liable for its breach of contract, but reversing the CBCA's decision to limit damages. The case was remanded to the CBCA for the purpose of calculating damages at a hearing. On May 20, 2016, Rockies Express and Interior agreed to resolve the claims in this matter in exchange for a   $65 million   cash payment to Rockies Express. Interior paid the amount due Rockies Express on June 23, 2016. 
  
   22 

Ultra Resources  
  In early 2016, Ultra Resources, Inc. ("Ultra") defaulted on its firm transportation service agreement for approximately   0.2   Bcf/d through November 11, 2019. In late March 2016, Rockies Express terminated Ultra's service agreement. On April 14, 2016, Rockies Express filed a lawsuit against Ultra for breach of contract and damages in Harris County, Texas, in which Rockies Express seeks approximately   $303 million   in damages and other relief. Specifically, Rockies Express has asserted that Ultra owes approximately   $303 million   for past transportation service charges and for reservation charge fees that Rockies Express would have received over the term of the service agreement had Ultra not defaulted, in addition to other amounts owed under law or equity. 
  On April 29, 2016, Ultra and certain of its debtor affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. On May 10, 2016, Ultra filed a notice of bankruptcy in the Harris County state court proceeding, which asserted that pursuant to section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of Ultra's Chapter 11 petition operated as a stay of the Harris County state court proceeding. Accordingly, Rockies Express intends to pursue its approximately   $303 million   claim in Ultra's Chapter 11 proceeding. 
  Michels Corporation  
  On June 17, 2014, Michels Corporation ("Michels") filed a complaint and request for relief against Rockies Express in the Court of Common Pleas, Monroe County, Ohio, as a result of work performed by Michels to construct the Seneca Lateral Pipeline in Ohio. Michels seeks unspecified damages from Rockies Express and asserts claims of breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. Michels has also filed notices of Mechanic's Liens in Monroe and Noble Counties, asserting   $24.2 million   as the amount due. The case is currently scheduled to go to trial in April 2017. Rockies Express also previously filed Petition for Declaratory Judgment, Injunctive Relief and Damages against Michels in Johnson County, Kansas. That claim was dismissed without prejudice in September 2015. Rockies Express believes Michels' claims are without merit and plans to continue to vigorously contest all of the claims in this matter. 
  Environmental, Health and Safety 
  We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws that regulate permitted activities relating to air and water quality, waste disposal, and other environmental matters. We believe that compliance with these laws will not have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial position or results of operations. However, there can be no assurances that future events, such as changes in existing laws, the promulgation of new laws, or the development of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. We had environmental reserves of   $4.3 million   and   $4.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  TMID 
  Casper Plant, EPA Notice of Violation 
  In August 2011, the EPA and the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality ("WDEQ") conducted an inspection of the Leak Detection and Repair ("LDAR") Program at the Casper Gas Plant in Wyoming. In September 2011, Tallgrass Midstream, LLC ("TMID") received a letter from the EPA alleging violations of the Standards of Performance of Equipment Leaks for Onshore Natural Gas Processing Plant requirements under the Clean Air Act. TMID received a letter from the EPA concerning settlement of this matter in April 2013 and received additional settlement communications from the EPA and Department of Justice beginning in July 2014. Settlement negotiations are continuing, including the expected inclusion of TIGT as a party to any possible settlement as a result of TIGT owning a compressor that is located adjacent to the Casper Gas Plant site. 
  Casper Mystery Bridge Superfund Site 
  The Casper Gas Plant is part of the Mystery Bridge Road/U.S. Highway 20 Superfund Site also known as Casper Mystery Bridge Superfund Site. Remediation work at the Casper Gas Plant has been completed and we have requested that the portion of the site attributable to us be delisted from the National Priorities List. 
  Casper Gas Plant 
  On November 25, 2014, WDEQ issued a Notice of Violation for violations of Part 60 Subpart OOOO related to the Depropanizer project (wv-14388, issued 7/9/13) in Docket No. 5506-14. TMID had discussed the issues in a meeting with WDEQ in Cheyenne on November 17, 2014, and submitted a disclosure on November 20, 2014 detailing the regulatory issues and potential violations. The project triggered a modification of Subpart OOOO for the entire plant. The project equipment as well as plant equipment subjected to Subpart OOOO was not monitored timely, and initial notification was not made timely. Settlement negotiations with WDEQ are currently ongoing.

Trailblazer 
  Pipeline Integrity Management Program 
  In 2014 and 2015, Trailblazer conducted smart tool surveys and preliminary analysis on segments of its natural gas pipeline to evaluate the growth rate of corrosion downstream of compressor stations. Trailblazer currently believes that approximately   25   -   35   miles of pipe will likely need to be repaired or replaced in order for the pipeline to operate at its maximum allowable operating pressure of   1,000   pounds per square inch. Such repair or replacement will likely occur over a period of years, depending upon final assessment of corrosion growth rates and the remediation and repair plan implemented by Trailblazer. Trailblazer is currently operating at less than its current maximum allowable operating pressure, public notice of which was first provided in June 2014. The current pressure reduction is not expected to prevent Trailblazer from fulfilling its firm service obligations at existing subscription levels and to date it has not had a material adverse financial impact on TEP.  
  During 2015, Trailblazer completed   32   excavation digs at an aggregate cost of approximately   $1.3 million   based on preliminary analysis of the smart tool surveys performed in 2014. Segments of the Trailblazer Pipeline that require full replacement are currently expected to cost in the range of approximately   $2.2 million   to   $2.7 million   per mile. Repair costs on sections of the pipeline that do not require full replacement are expected to be less on a per mile basis. Trailblazer is continuing to develop a remediation and repair plan, which involves, among other things, finalizing cost recovery options, establishing project scope and timing and setting an overall project budget. In 2016, Trailblazer intends to replace approximately   8   miles of pipe, install additional ground beds, and continue remediating areas with external control anomalies at an estimated cost of   $21.5 million  . Trailblazer is currently exploring all possible cost recovery options. It may not ultimately be able to recover any or all of such out of pocket costs unless and until Trailblazer recovers them through a general rate increase or other FERC-approved recovery mechanism, or through negotiated rate agreements with its customers. 
  In connection with TEP's acquisition of the Trailblazer Pipeline, TD agreed to contractually indemnify TEP for any out of pocket costs incurred between April 1, 2014 and April 1, 2017 related to repairing or remediating the Trailblazer Pipeline, to the extent that such actions are necessitated by external corrosion caused by the pipeline's disbonded Hi-Melt CTE coating. The contractual indemnity provided to TEP by TD is currently capped at   $20 million   and is subject to an annual   $1.5 million   deductible. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , TEP received contributions of   $5.3 million   from TD related to the indemnity. 
   
  14.	Reporting Segments    
  Our operations are located in the United States. We are organized into   three   reporting segments: (1) Crude Oil Transportation   Logistics, (2) Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics, and (3) Processing   Logistics. 
  Crude Oil Transportation   Logistics 
  The Crude Oil Transportation   Logistics segment is engaged in the ownership and operation of the Pony Express System, which is a FERC-regulated crude oil pipeline serving the Bakken Shale, Denver-Julesburg and Powder River Basins, and other nearby oil producing basins. The mainline portion of the Pony Express System was placed in service in October 2014. The Pony Express System also includes a lateral pipeline in Northeast Colorado, which interconnects with the Pony Express System just east of Sterling, Colorado and was placed in service in the second quarter of 2015.  
  Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics 
  The Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics segment is engaged in the ownership and operation of FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipelines and integrated natural gas storage facilities that provide services to on-system customers (such as third-party LDCs), industrial users and other shippers. The Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics segment includes our   25%   membership interest in Rockies Express effective May 6, 2016, as discussed in   Note 3       Acquisitions  . 
  Processing   Logistics 
  The Processing   Logistics segment is engaged in the ownership and operation of natural gas processing, treating and fractionation facilities that produce NGLs and residue gas that is sold in local wholesale markets or delivered into pipelines for transportation to additional end markets, as well as water business services provided primarily to the oil and gas exploration and production industry and the transportation of NGLs. 
  Corporate and Other 
  Corporate and Other includes corporate overhead costs that are not directly associated with the operations of our reportable segments, such as interest and fees associated with our revolving credit facility, public company costs, and equity-based compensation expense. 
  
   24 

These segments are monitored separately by management for performance and are consistent with internal financial reporting. These segments have been identified based on the differing products and services, regulatory environment and the expertise required for their respective operations. 
  We consider Adjusted EBITDA our primary segment performance measure as we believe it is the most meaningful measure to assess our financial condition and results of operations as a public entity. We define Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, as   net income excluding the impact of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash income or loss related to derivative instruments, non-cash long-term compensation expense, impairment losses, gains or losses on asset or business disposals or acquisitions, gains or losses on the repurchase, redemption or early retirement of debt, and earnings from unconsolidated investments, but including the impact of distributions from unconsolidated investments.    
  The following tables set forth our segment information for the periods indicated:

  Overview 
  We are a publicly traded, growth-oriented limited partnership formed in 2013 to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream energy assets in North America. We currently provide crude oil transportation to customers in Wyoming, Colorado, and the surrounding regions through Tallgrass Pony Express Pipeline, LLC ("Pony Express"), which owns a crude oil pipeline commencing in Guernsey, Wyoming and terminating in Cushing, Oklahoma that includes a lateral in Northeast Colorado that commences in Weld County, Colorado, and interconnects with the pipeline just east of Sterling, Colorado (the "Pony Express System"). We provide natural gas transportation and storage services for customers in the Rocky Mountain, Midwest and Appalachian regions of the United States through: (1) our 25% membership interest in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC ("Rockies Express"), a Delaware limited liability company which owns the Rockies Express Pipeline, a FERC-regulated natural gas pipeline system extending from Opal, Wyoming and Meeker, Colorado to Clarington, Ohio, (2) the Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission system, a FERC-regulated natural gas transportation and storage system located in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Wyoming (the "TIGT System"), and (3) the Trailblazer Pipeline system, a FERC-regulated natural gas pipeline system extending from the Colorado and Wyoming border to Beatrice, Nebraska (the "Trailblazer Pipeline"). We also provide services for customers in Wyoming at the Casper and Douglas natural gas processing facilities and the West Frenchie Draw natural gas treating facility (collectively, the "Midstream Facilities"), and NGL transportation services in Northeast Colorado. We perform water business services in Colorado and Texas through BNN Water Solutions, LLC ("Water Solutions"). Our operations are strategically located in and provide services to certain key United States hydrocarbon basins, including the Denver-Julesburg, Powder River, Wind River, Permian and Hugoton-Anadarko Basins and the Niobrara, Mississippi Lime, Eagle Ford, Bakken, Marcellus and Utica shale formations. 
  We intend to continue to leverage our relationship with TD and utilize the significant experience of our management team to execute our growth strategy of acquiring midstream assets from TD and third parties, increasing utilization of our existing assets and expanding our systems through construction of additional assets. Our reportable business segments are: 
             
    Crude Oil Transportation   Logistics the ownership and operation of a FERC-regulated crude oil pipeline system;

Exercise of Call Option 
  On October 31, 2016, we partially exercised the call option granted by TD in January 2016 as discussed in   Note 3       Acquisitions   covering   1,251,760   common units. These common units were deemed canceled upon the exercise of the call option and as of the exercise date were no longer issued and outstanding. As of   November 2, 2016  ,   1,703,094   common units remained subject to the call option. 
   
  How We Evaluate Our Operations  
  We evaluate our results using, among other measures, contract profile and volumes, operating costs and expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP measures and are defined below. 
  Contract Profile and Volumes 
  Our results are driven primarily by the volume of crude oil transportation capacity, natural gas transportation and storage capacity, NGL transportation capacity, and water transportation, gathering and disposal capacity under firm fee contracts, as well as the volume of natural gas that we process and the fees assessed for such services.  
  Operating Costs and Expenses 
  The primary components of our operating costs and expenses that we evaluate include cost of sales, cost of transportation services, operations and maintenance and general and administrative costs. Our operating expenses are driven primarily by expenses related to the operation, maintenance and growth of our asset base. 
  Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow 
  Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess: 
             
    our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods; 
                
    the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders; 
                
    our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and 
                
    the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various expansion and growth opportunities. 
     We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP, nor should Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow be considered alternatives to available cash, operating surplus, distributions of available cash from operating surplus or other definitions in our partnership agreement. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  We generally define Adjusted EBITDA as   net income excluding the impact of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash income or loss related to derivative instruments, non-cash long-term compensation expense, impairment losses, gains or losses on asset or business disposals or acquisitions, gains or losses on the repurchase, redemption or early retirement of debt, and earnings from unconsolidated investments, but including the impact of distributions from unconsolidated investments.   We also use Distributable Cash Flow, which we generally define as   Adjusted EBITDA, plus deficiency payments received from or utilized by our customers and preferred distributions received from Pony Express in excess of its distributable cash flow attributable to our net interest, less cash interest expense, maintenance capital expenditures, distributions to noncontrolling interests in excess of earnings allocated to noncontrolling interests, and certain cash reserves permitted by our partnership agreement  , to analyze our performance.  
  Maintenance capital expenditures are cash expenditures incurred (including expenditures for the construction or development of new capital assets) that we expect to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. These expenditures typically include certain system integrity, compliance and safety improvements, and are presented net of noncontrolling interest and reimbursements. As discussed in   Note 2       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  , prior to December 31, 2015, we received preferred distributions from Pony Express. Effective January 1, 2016 with our acquisition of an additional 31.3% membership interest in Pony Express, distributable cash flow from Pony Express is distributed pro rata based on ownership. Pony Express collects deficiency payments for barrels committed by the customer to be transported in a month but not physically received for transport or delivered to the customers' agreed upon destination point. These deficiency payments are recorded as a deferred liability until the barrels are physically transported and delivered by TEP. Earnings at Pony Express prior to December 31, 2015 were allocated between TEP and noncontrolling interests in accordance with a substantive profit sharing arrangement rather than pro rata by ownership. Distributions made by Pony Express to its noncontrolling interests reduce the Distributable Cash Flow available to TEP. 
  Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income and net cash provided by operating activities and a reconciliation of Distributable Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated:

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenues.   Total revenues were   $152.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $138.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   an increase   of   $14.0 million  , or   10%  , in total revenues. The overall   increase   in revenue was largely driven by increased revenues of   $12.6 million   and   $1.3 million   in the Crude Oil Transportation   Logistics and Processing   Logistics segments, respectively, as discussed further below. 
  Operating costs and expenses  . Operating costs and expenses were   $87.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $85.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   an increase   of   $2.3 million  , or   3%  . The overall   increase   in operating costs and expenses was primarily driven by increased operating costs and expenses of   $3.4 million  , $1.5 million and   $1.0 million   in the Crude Oil Transportation   Logistics, Corporate and Other, and Processing   Logistics segments, respectively, partially offset by decreased operating costs and expenses of   $3.6 million   in the Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics segment, as discussed further below. 
  Interest expense, net.   Interest expense of   $10.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   $3.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   was primarily composed of interest and fees associated with our revolving credit facility, as well as the 2024 Notes issued on September 1, 2016. The increase in interest and fees associated with our revolving credit facility is primarily due to increased borrowings to fund a portion of our December 2015 acquisition of BNN Western, LLC ("Western") and our recent acquisitions of an additional 31.3% membership interest in Pony Express effective January 1, 2016 and 25% membership interest in Rockies Express effective May 6, 2016. 
  Unrealized loss on derivative instrument.   Unrealized loss on derivative instrument of   $4.4 million   represents the change in fair value of the call option received from TD as part of the acquisition of an additional   31.3%   membership interest in Pony Express effective January 1, 2016.  
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated investment.   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated investment of   $12.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   reflects our portion of earnings and the amortization of a negative basis difference of $3.5 million associated with our acquisition of a 25% membership interest in Rockies Express effective May 6, 2016.  
  Other income, net.   Other income, net typically includes rental income and income earned from certain customers related to the capital costs we incurred to connect these customers to our system. Other income was   $0.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.   Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of   $1.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   primarily reflects the net income allocated to TD's 2% noncontrolling interest in Pony Express. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of   $6.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   primarily reflects income allocated to TD's 33.3% noncontrolling interest of Pony Express. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenues.   Total revenues were   $444.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $385.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   an increase   of   $58.6 million  , or   15%  , in total revenues. The overall   increase   in revenue was largely driven by increased revenues of   $75.0 million   in the Crude Oil Transportation   Logistics segment, partially offset by decreased revenues of   $12.9 million   and   $3.3 million   in the Processing   Logistics and Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics segments, respectively, as discussed further below. 
  Operating costs and expenses  . Operating costs and expenses were   $259.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $250.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   an increase   of   $8.2 million  , or   3%  . The overall   increase   in operating costs and expenses is primarily driven by increased operating costs and expenses of   $19.2 million   in the Crude Oil Transportation   Logistics segment, partially offset by decreased operating costs and expenses of   $7.3 million   and   $5.3 million   in the Processing   Logistics and Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics segments, respectively, as discussed further below. 
  Interest expense, net.   Interest expense of   $27.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily composed of interest and fees associated with our revolving credit facility and the 2024 Notes issued on September 1, 2016. Interest expense of   $11.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was primarily composed of interest and fees associated with our revolving credit facility, partially offset by interest income of $0.4 million on the cash balance swept to TD under the Pony Express cash management agreement. The increase in interest and fees associated with our revolving credit facility is primarily due to increased borrowings to fund a portion of our 2015 acquisitions and our recent acquisitions of an additional 31.3% membership interest in Pony Express effective January 1, 2016 and a 25% membership interest in Rockies Express effective May 6, 2016. 
  
   32 

Unrealized gain on derivative instrument.   Unrealized gain on derivative instrument of   $5.6 million   represents the change in fair value of the call option received from TD as part of the acquisition of an additional   31.3%   membership interest in Pony Express effective January 1, 2016. 
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated investment.   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated investment of   $35.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflects our portion of earnings and the amortization of a negative basis difference of $5.6 million associated with our acquisition of a 25% membership interest in Rockies Express effective May 6, 2016. The equity in earnings for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   includes recognition of our portion of the $65 million settlement received by Rockies Express related to the lawsuit between Interior and Rockies Express as discussed in   Note 13       Legal and Environmental Matters  . 
  Other income, net.   Other income, net typically includes rental income and income earned from certain customers related to the capital costs we incurred to connect these customers to our system. Other income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $1.3 million   compared to   $2.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.   Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of   $3.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily reflects the net income allocated to TD's 2% noncontrolling interest in Pony Express. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of   $5.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily reflects the net income allocated to TD's 66.7% noncontrolling interest in Pony Express for the period from January 1, 2015 to February 28, 2015 and TD's 33.3% noncontrolling interest for the period from March 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015. 
   
  The following provides a summary of our Crude Oil Transportation   Logistics segment results of operations for the periods indicated: 

(1)   
    Segment results as presented represent total revenue and operating income, including intersegment activity. For reconciliations to the consolidated financial data, see   Note 14       Reporting Segments   to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
     Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenues.   Crude Oil Transportation   Logistics segment revenues were   $95.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $83.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   an increase   of   $12.6 million  , or   15%  , in segment revenues. The increase in segment revenues was primarily due to a   $9.5 million   increase in crude oil transportation services and a   $3.1 million   increase in the sales of natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil driven by increased volumes of crude oil sold. The increase in crude oil transportation services revenue was primarily driven by increased revenues of $4.5 million related to increased commitments on two throughput and deficiency agreements during the second quarter of 2016 and $4.3 million due to increased volumes transported under existing commitments during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  
   33 

Operating costs and expenses  . Operating costs and expenses in the Crude Oil Transportation   Logistics segment were   $42.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $39.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   an increase   of   $3.4 million  , or   9%  . The overall   increase   in operating costs and expenses was primarily driven by a   $2.0 million   increase in cost of sales due to increased volumes of crude oil sold, partially offset by decreased crude oil prices, and a   $1.0 million   increase in taxes, other than income taxes, as a result of the lateral in Northeast Colorado which was placed in service during the second quarter of 2015. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenues.   Crude Oil Transportation   Logistics segment revenues were   $283.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $208.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   an increase   of   $75.0 million  , or   36%  , in segment revenues primarily due to increased revenues of $40.2 million from a full period of operations on the lateral in Northeast Colorado, which began commercial operations during the second quarter of 2015, an $18.7 million increase related to the activation of one of our joint tariffs in the second quarter of 2015, lower revenue of $9.7 million due to a force majeure at one of our joint tariff partners during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , and a $7.6 million increase in incremental barrels shipped during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Operating costs and expenses  . Operating costs and expenses in the Crude Oil Transportation   Logistics segment were   $124.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $105.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   an increase   of   $19.2 million  , or   18%  . The overall   increase   in operating costs and expenses was primarily driven by a   $8.0 million   increase in cost of transportation services, a   $4.2 million   increase in operations and maintenance costs, a   $3.7 million   increase in depreciation and amortization, and a   $2.7 million   increase in taxes, other than income taxes all primarily driven by the costs associated with a full period of operations on the lateral in Northeast Colorado, which began commercial operations during the second quarter of 2015. 
   
  The following provides a summary of our Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics segment results of operations for the periods indicated:

   34 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenues.   Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics segment revenues were   $33.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $33.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   an increase   of   $0.2 million  , or   1%  . The   increase   in segment revenues was primarily due to an increase of   $2.1 million   in natural gas transportation services primarily driven by increased tariff rates, partially offset by a change in the fuel recovery structure, recognized at TIGT beginning May 1, 2016 as a result of the rate case settlement discussed in   Note 12       Regulatory Matters  . The increase in transportation services revenue was partially offset by a   $1.9 million     decrease   in sales of natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil as a result of lower volumes of natural gas sales.  
  Operating costs and expenses  . Operating costs and expenses in the Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics segment were   $19.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $23.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   a decrease   of   $3.6 million  , or   15%  . The overall   decrease   in operating costs and expenses was primarily driven by a   $1.9 million   decrease in cost of transportation services due to lower costs associated with fuel reimbursements as a result of the change in the fuel recovery structure discussed above and a   $1.8 million   decrease in cost of sales as a result of lower volumes sold. These decreases were partially offset by a   $0.8 million   increase in operations and maintenance due to increased pipeline integrity work during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenues.   Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics segment revenues were   $94.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $98.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   a decrease   of   $3.3 million  , or   3%  , in segment revenues as a result of a   $2.2 million   decrease in sales of natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil as a result of lower volumes of natural gas sold and a 14% decrease in natural gas prices and a   $1.1 million   decrease in natural gas transportation services primarily driven by a change in the fuel recovery structure as discussed above and warmer weather conditions that created less demand for short-term transportation capacity during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . These decreases were partially offset by increased tariff rates recognized at TIGT subsequent to the rate case settlement effective May 1, 2016. 
  Operating costs and expenses  . Operating costs and expenses in the Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics segment were   $59.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $65.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   a decrease   of   $5.3 million  , or   8%  . The overall   decrease   in operating costs and expenses was primarily driven by a   $4.7 million   decrease in cost of transportation services due to lower costs associated with fuel reimbursements as a result of the change in the fuel recovery structure discussed above, a   $0.8 million   decrease in depreciation and amortization due to lower depreciation rates as of May 1, 2016 as a result of the TIGT rate case settlement, a   $0.7 million   decrease in general and administrative costs due to a reduction in allocated costs to the segment and a   $0.2 million   decrease in cost of sales due to decreased volumes of natural gas sold, partially offset by a reduction in our fuel tracker obligations at Trailblazer driven by the FERC approval of our annual fuel tracker filing during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . These decreases were partially offset by a   $1.3 million   increase in operations and maintenance due to increased pipeline integrity work during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

    Segment results as presented represent total revenue and operating income, including intersegment activity. For reconciliations to the consolidated financial data, see   Note 14       Reporting Segments   to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
     Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenues.   Processing   Logistics segment revenues were   $23.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $22.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents a   $1.3 million  , or   6%  ,   increase   in segment revenues. The   increase   in segment revenues was primarily due to a   $2.0 million   increase in processing and other revenues driven by increased revenue of $2.0 million at Water Solutions primarily attributable to BNN Western, LLC ("Western"), which was acquired on December 16, 2015, and BNN West Texas, LLC ("West Texas"), which commenced operations in March 2016. The increase in processing and other revenues was partially offset by a   $0.7 million   decrease in the sales of natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil driven by lower NGL sales of $0.4 million due to lower volumes processed, partially offset by increased NGL prices, and lower natural gas sales of $0.3 million due to decreased volumes of natural gas sold. 
  Operating costs and expenses  . Operating costs and expenses in the Processing   Logistics segment were   $23.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $22.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   an increase   of   $1.0 million  , or   4%  . The   increase   in operating costs and expenses was driven by a   $1.1 million   increase in cost of transportation services due to costs associated with Western, which was acquired on December 16, 2015, a   $0.3 million   increase in general and administrative costs due to increased costs allocated to Water Solutions as a result of increased operating income related to our acquisitions of Western and West Texas and a   $0.3 million   increase in cost of sales, partially offset by a   $0.7 million   decrease in operations and maintenance costs due to less downtime for plant maintenance activities during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenues.   Processing   Logistics segment revenues were   $69.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $82.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents a   $12.9 million  , or   16%  ,   decrease   in segment revenues. The   decrease   in segment revenues was primarily due to a   $10.5 million   decrease in the sales of natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil driven by lower NGL sales of $9.4 million due to lower volumes processed and a 7% decrease in NGL prices and a   $2.5 million   decrease in processing and other revenues driven by lower processing fees at TMID due to decreased volumes processed, partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in revenue at Water Solutions primarily attributable to the recently acquired Western and West Texas assets.

Operating costs and expenses  . Operating costs and expenses in the Processing   Logistics segment were   $70.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $78.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents   a decrease   of   $7.3 million  , or   9%  . The   decrease   in operating costs and expenses was driven by a decrease of   $7.5 million   in cost of sales, primarily due to decreased NGL prices and volumes processed as discussed above, a decrease of   $2.6 million   in loss on disposal of assets as a result of the $1.8 million loss on Western assets destroyed by fire as a result of a lightning strike during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a $4.5 million non-cash loss recognized on the sale of compressor assets at TMID in 2015 and a   $0.5 million   decrease in operations and maintenance costs due to less downtime for plant maintenance activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . These decreases were partially offset by a   $1.6 million   increase in cost of transportation services due to costs associated with Western, which was acquired on December 16, 2015, a   $1.4 million   increase in general and administrative costs due to increased costs allocated to Water Solutions as a result of increased operating income related to our acquisitions of Western and West Texas and a   $0.8 million   increase in taxes, other than income taxes, due to higher property tax estimates for 2016 as a result of the Western acquisition. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview 
  Our primary sources of liquidity for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt as discussed further below, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, cash generated from operations, and proceeds from the issuance of common units. We expect our sources of liquidity in the future to include: 
             
    cash generated from our operations; 
                
    borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility; and 
                
    future issuances of additional partnership units and/or debt securities. 
     We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our operating needs, our planned short-term maintenance capital and debt service requirements and our planned cash distributions to unitholders. We believe that future internal growth projects or potential acquisitions will be funded primarily through a combination of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt and/or equity securities. 
  Our total liquidity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows: 

Revolving Credit Facility 
  Effective January 4, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of an additional 31.3% membership interest in Pony Express, TEP exercised the committed accordion feature to increase the total capacity of the revolving credit facility from   $1.1 billion   to   $1.5 billion  . In connection with the acquisition of a   25%   membership interest in Rockies Express, TEP amended the revolving credit facility to increase the total capacity to   $1.75 billion  , which increase became effective May 6, 2016.  
  The revolving credit facility contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability (as well as the ability of our restricted subsidiaries) to incur or guarantee additional debt, incur certain liens on assets, dispose of assets, make certain distributions (including distributions from available cash, if a default or event of default under the credit agreement then exists or would result from making such a distribution), change the nature of our business, engage in certain mergers or make certain investments and acquisitions, enter into non-arms-length transactions with affiliates and designate certain subsidiaries as "Unrestricted Subsidiaries." In addition, we are required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than   4.75   to 1.00 (which will be increased to   5.25   to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions) and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than   2.50   to 1.00. As of   September 30, 2016  , we are in compliance with the covenants required under the revolving credit facility. 
  The unused portion of the revolving credit facility is subject to a commitment fee, which ranges from   0.300%   to   0.500%  , based on our total leverage ratio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was   2.28%  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our weighted average effective interest rate, including the interest on outstanding borrowings, commitment fees, and amortization of deferred financing costs, was   2.72%  . 
  Senior Unsecured Notes 
  On September 1, 2016, TEP and Tallgrass Energy Finance Corp. (the "Co-Issuer" and together with TEP, the "Issuers"), the Guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank, National Association, as trustee, entered into an Indenture dated September 1, 2016 (the "Indenture"), pursuant to which the Issuers issued   $400 million   in aggregate principal amount of the Issuers'   5.50%   senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes"). TEP used the net proceeds of the offering to repay outstanding borrowings under its existing senior secured revolving credit facility. 
  The 2024 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Issuers. The 2024 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior unsecured basis by TEP's existing direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer) and certain of TEP's future subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). The 2024 Notes rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuers, and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuers. The 2024 Notes will mature on September 15, 2024 and interest on the 2024 Notes is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on each March 15 and September 15, commencing March 15, 2017. TEP may redeem the 2024 Notes prior to their scheduled maturity at the applicable redemption price set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
  The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit TEP's ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred units; (ii) create liens to secure indebtedness; (iii) pay distributions on equity interests, repurchase equity securities or redeem subordinated securities; (iv) make investments; (v) restrict distributions, loans or other asset transfers from TEP's restricted subsidiaries; (vi) consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of TEP's properties to, another person; (vii) sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including equity interests in subsidiaries; and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. As of   September 30, 2016  , we are in compliance with the covenants required under the 2024 Notes. 
  Equity Distribution Agreements 
  On October 31, 2014, we entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which we may sell from time to time through a group of managers, as our sales agents, common units representing limited partner interests having an aggregate offering price of up to   $200 million  . On May 13, 2015 the amount was subsequently amended to   $100.2 million   in order to account for follow-on equity offerings under our S-3 shelf registration statement. On May 17, 2016, we entered into a new equity distribution agreement allowing for the sale of common units with an aggregate offering price of up to   $657.5 million  . Sales of common units, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions, to or through a market maker or directly on or through an electronic communication network, a "dark pool" or any similar market venue, or as otherwise agreed by the Partnership and one or more of the managers. We intend to use the net cash proceeds from any sale of the units for general partnership purposes, which may include, among other things, the Partnership's exercise of the call option with respect to the   6,518,000   common units issued to TD in connection with the Partnership's acquisition of an additional   31.3%   of Pony Express in January 2016, repayment or refinancing of debt, funding for acquisitions, capital expenditures and additions to working capital. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued and sold   622,846   common units with a weighted average sales price of   $47.39   per unit under our equity distribution agreements for net cash proceeds of approximately   $28.7 million   (net of approximately   $0.8 million   in commissions and professional service expenses). During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we issued and sold   6,703,984   common units with a weighted average sales price of   $43.98   per unit under our equity distribution agreements for net cash proceeds of approximately   $290.5 million   (net of approximately   $4.4 million   in commissions and professional service expenses). During the period from October 1, 2016 to November 2, 2016, we issued and sold an additional   628,914   common units with a weighted average sales price of   $48.05   per unit under our equity distribution agreement for net cash proceeds of approximately   $29.9 million   (net of approximately   $0.3 million   in commissions and professional service expenses). We used the net cash proceeds for general partnership purposes as described above. 
  Private Placement 
  On April 28, 2016, we issued an aggregate of   2,416,987   common units for net cash proceeds of   $90.0 million   in a private placement transaction to certain funds managed by Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C. The units were subsequently registered pursuant to our Form S-3/A (File No. 333-210976) filed with the SEC on May 6, 2016, which became effective May 17, 2016.  
  
   37 

Working Capital 
  Working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. While various other factors may impact our working capital requirements from period to period, our working capital requirements have typically been, and we expect will continue to be, driven by changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable and deferred revenue. Factors impacting changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable could include the timing of collections from customers, payments to suppliers, and the level of spending for capital expenditures. Changes in the market prices of energy commodities, primarily NGLs, that we buy and sell in the normal course of business can also impact the timing of changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable. Factors impacting deferred revenue include the volume of crude oil transported, the amount of deficiency payments received, and the volume of prior deficiencies utilized during the period. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a working capital   deficit   of   $17.0 million   compared to a working capital   deficit   of   $11.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  , which represents   a decrease   in working capital of   $5.3 million  . The overall   decrease   in working capital was primarily attributable to changes in the following components: 
             
    an increase in deferred revenue of   $25.6 million   primarily from deficiency payments collected by Pony Express; 
                
    an increase in accrued taxes of   $6.8 million   as a result of tax assessments; and 
                
    a decrease of   $4.7 million   in accounts receivable primarily due to a decrease in incremental barrels shipped at Pony Express in September 2016 compared to December 2015. 
     These working capital   decreases   were partially offset by: 
             
    an increase of   $25.7 million   in derivative assets at fair value as a result of the reclassification of the call option derivative to current assets as of September 30, 2016; and 
                
    a decrease of   $5.2 million   in accounts payable, primarily driven by the timing of project invoices and payment of contractor retainages related to the construction of the Pony Express lateral in Northeast Colorado. 
     A material adverse change in operations, available financing under our revolving credit facility, or available financing from the equity or debt capital markets could impact our ability to fund our requirements for liquidity and capital resources in the future. 
   
  Cash Flows 
  The following table and discussion presents a summary of our cash flow for the periods indicated: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Operating Activities.   Cash flows   provided by   operating activities were   $305.9 million   and   $197.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The   increase   in net cash flows   provided by   operating activities of   $108.4 million   was primarily driven by the increase in operating results as discussed above, distributions received from Rockies Express, and a net increase in cash inflows from changes in working capital, primarily driven by a   $19.5 million   increase in net cash inflows from accounts receivable due to collection of receivables during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 associated primarily with an increase of incremental barrels shipped at Pony Express, and a   $11.3 million   increase in deferred revenue associated primarily with deficiency payments received by Pony Express. 
  
   38 

Investing Activities.   Cash flows   used in   investing activities were   $549.6 million   and   $769.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash used in investing activities were driven by cash outflows of   $436.0 million   for the acquisition of a 25% membership interest in Rockies Express on May 6, 2016,   $49.1 million   for a portion of the acquisition of an additional 31.3% membership interest in Pony Express on January 1, 2016, the remainder of which is classified as a financing activity as discussed below, capital expenditures of   $45.3 million  , primarily due to post in-service spending on Pony Express System projects, and contributions to Rockies Express in the amount of   $35.5 million  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , net cash   used in   investing activities were driven by the   $700.0 million   cash outflow for the acquisition of an additional 33.3% membership interest in Pony Express, which allowed TD to continue funding the pipeline construction at Pony Express, and capital expenditures of   $65.1 million  , primarily due to construction of the Pony Express System, including the lateral in Northeast Colorado. 
     Financing Activities.   Cash flows   provided by   financing activities were   $242.5 million   and   $590.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Financing cash inflows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were primarily driven by: 
               
    net borrowings under the revolving credit facility of   $252.0 million  ; 
                
    the issuance of   2,416,987   common units representing limited partnership interests in a private placement transaction for net cash proceeds of   $90.0 million  ; and 
                
    contributions from noncontrolling interests of   $8.7 million  , which primarily consisted of contributions from TD to Pony Express. 
     These financing cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows of: 
             
    $425.9 million   for the portion of the acquisition of an additional 31.3% membership interest in Pony Express which exceeds the cumulative capital spending on the underlying assets acquired; and 
                
    distributions to unitholders of   $207.5 million  ; and 
      Cash flows   provided by   financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   were primarily driven by: 
              
    net borrowings under the revolving credit facility of   $137.0 million  ; and 
                
    contributions from noncontrolling interests of   $19.3 million  , primarily driven by contributions from TD to Pony Express. 
     These financing cash inflows were partially offset by distributions to unitholders of   $113.3 million  . 
   
  Distributions 
  We do not have a legal obligation to pay distributions except as provided in our partnership agreement. A distribution of   $0.795   per unit, or   $85.3 million   in the aggregate, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was announced on   October 5, 2016   and will be paid on   November 14, 2016   to unitholders of record on   October 31, 2016  . As of   November 2, 2016  , we had a total of   72,949,796   common and general partner units outstanding, which equates to an aggregate minimum quarterly distribution of approximately   $21.0 million   per quarter and approximately   $83.9 million   per year. We intend to continue to pay quarterly distributions at or above the amount of the minimum quarterly distribution, which is $0.2875 per unit. 
   
  Capital Requirements 
  The midstream energy business can be capital-intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain and upgrade existing operations. Our capital requirements have consisted primarily of, and we anticipate will continue to consist of, the following: 
             
    maintenance capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred (including expenditures for the construction or development of new capital assets) that we expect to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. These expenditures typically include certain system integrity, compliance and safety improvements; and 
     
   39 

expansion capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures to increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long-term. Expansion capital expenditures include acquisitions or capital improvements (such as additions to or improvements on the capital assets owned, or acquisition or construction of new capital assets). 
     We expect to incur approximately $46 million for capital expenditures in   2016  , of which approximately $34 million is expected for expansion projects and approximately $12 million, net of anticipated reimbursements from affiliates, is expected for maintenance capital expenditures. 
  The determination of capital expenditures as maintenance or expansion is made at the individual asset level during our budgeting process and as we approve, execute, and monitor our capital spending. The following table summarizes the maintenance and expansion capital expenditures incurred at our consolidated entities: 

Capital expenditures incurred represent capital expenditures paid and accrued during the period. Capital expenditures are presented net of noncontrolling interest, and contributions and reimbursements received. The   decrease   in maintenance capital expenditures to   $7.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $9.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   is primarily driven by decreased maintenance capital expenditures in the Processing   Logistics and the Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics segments. Maintenance capital expenditures on our assets occur on a regular schedule, but most major maintenance projects are not required every year so the level of maintenance capital expenditures naturally varies from year to year and from quarter to quarter. The   increase   in expansion capital expenditures to   $19.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $17.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   is primarily driven by spending on the Pony Express System lateral in Northeast Colorado prior to commencement of commercial operations in the second quarter of 2015. Expansion capital expenditures of   $19.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   consisted primarily of post in-service spending on Pony Express System projects. 
  We intend to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our general partner. Due to our cash distribution policy, we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders most of the cash generated by our operations. We expect to fund future capital expenditures with funds generated from our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, the issuance of additional partnership units and/or the issuance of long-term debt. If these sources are not sufficient, we may reduce our discretionary spending. 
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations as reported in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements are set forth in our 2015 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and have not changed. Our disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with respect to goodwill is repeated below for the purpose of providing additional information regarding the impairment testing performed as of December 31, 2015. 
  
   40 

Description 
      
    Judgments and Uncertainties 
      
    Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions 
      Impairment of Goodwill 
      We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. 
      
    We determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses. These techniques are also used when assigning the purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities. These types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry and economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. Our impairment analyses require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows as well as asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets, assessing the probability of different outcomes, including anticipated volumes, contract renewals and changes in our regulated rates, and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. 
      
    We primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis, supplemented by a market approach analysis, to perform the assessment. Key assumptions in the analysis include the use of an appropriate discount rate, terminal year multiples, and estimated future cash flows including an estimate of operating and general and administrative costs. In estimating cash flows, we incorporate current market information, as well as historical and other factors, into our forecasted commodity prices. If our assumptions are not appropriate, or future events indicate that our goodwill is impaired, our net income would be impacted by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, to the extent of the balance of goodwill. A prolonged period of lower commodity prices may adversely affect our estimate of future operating results, which could result in future goodwill impairment for reporting units due to the potential impact on our operations and cash flows. We completed our impairment testing of goodwill in the third quarter of 2015 using the methodology described herein, and determined there was no impairment. As a result of a decreased commodity prices in late 2015 and into early 2016, which caused a significant drop in the volumes anticipated from several producers from which TMID receives natural gas for processing, we identified a potential impairment trigger with respect to the $79.2 million of goodwill at the TMID reporting unit, which is a component of our Processing   Logistics segment. We tested TMID's goodwill for impairment as of December 31, 2015 and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value by approximately 21%. As a result, no impairment charge was recorded, however our analysis includes assumptions of a gradual recovery of commodity prices and a corresponding increase in volumes over time. If our outlook for long-term commodity prices is not realized, or our producers further decrease volumes, we could have an impairment in the future. While commodity prices do not have a significant direct exposure to the cash flows projected at TMID, the current commodity price environment has had an indirect impact on TMID's business as certain producers have significantly reduced their anticipated volumes. Keeping all other assumptions constant, as of December 31, 2015 an increase in the discount rate applied of approximately 1.38% or a decrease in overall cash flows by more than 16% would result in a step one failure, however we do not believe that these represent reasonably likely assumptions. If the reporting unit fails step one in the future, we would be required to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test and up to $79.2 million of goodwill at the TMID reporting unit could be written off in the period that the impairment is triggered. During the third quarter of 2016, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing for all reporting units, and determined that there was no impairment.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016   approximately 91% of our reserved processing capacity was subject to firm or volumetric fee contracts, with the majority of fee revenue based on the volumes actually processed. The remaining 9% was subject to commodity sensitive contracts such as percent of proceeds or keep whole processing contracts. The profitability of our commodity sensitive processing contracts that include keep whole or percent of proceeds components is affected by volatility in prevailing NGL and natural gas prices. We do not currently hedge the commodity exposure in our commodity sensitive contracts in our Processing   Logistics segment and we do not expect to in the foreseeable future. Starting in 2014, the prices of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs were extremely volatile and declined significantly. Downward pressure and volatility on commodity prices continued in 2015 and the first half of 2016 and may continue for the foreseeable future. These declines directly and indirectly resulted in lower realizations and processing volumes on our percent of proceeds and keep whole processing contracts. Our Processing   Logistics segment comprised approximately   3%   of our Adjusted EBITDA for both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  We have a limited amount of direct commodity price exposure related to crude oil collected as part of our contractual pipeline loss allowance at Pony Express. During the third quarter of 2016, we entered into a derivative contract for the sale of   30,000   barrels of crude oil, which settled in October 2016. The fair value of this swap was a liability of approximately   $7,000   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Historically, we have also had a limited amount of direct commodity price exposure related to natural gas collected for electrical compression costs and lost and unaccounted for gas on the TIGT System. We have entered into derivative contracts with third parties for a substantial majority of the gas we expect to collect during the current year for the purpose of hedging our commodity price exposures. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had short natural gas swaps outstanding with a notional volume of approximately   0.8   Bcf, representing a portion of the natural gas that is expected to be sold by our Natural Gas Transportation   Logistics segment through the first quarter of 2017. The fair value of these swaps was a liability of approximately   $0.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  We measure the risk of price changes in our natural gas swaps utilizing a sensitivity analysis model. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential income or loss (i.e., the change in fair value of the derivative instruments) based upon a hypothetical 10% movement in the underlying quoted market prices. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values. We enter into derivative contracts solely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and, therefore, both the sensitivity analysis model and the change in the market value of our outstanding derivative contracts are offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical commodity prices. A hypothetical 10% increase in the crude oil price forward curve would result in a decrease of approximately $0.1 million in the net fair value of our crude oil derivative instruments as of   September 30, 2016  . A hypothetical 10% increase in the natural gas price forward curve would result in a decrease of approximately $0.2 million in the fair value of our natural gas derivative instruments as of   September 30, 2016   as a result of our hedging program. For the purpose of determining the change in fair value associated with the hypothetical natural gas price increase scenario, we have assumed a parallel shift in the forward curve through the end of 2016. 
  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") has promulgated regulations to implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act's changes to the Commodity Exchange Act, including the definition of commodity-based swaps subject to those regulations. The CFTC regulations are intended to implement new reporting and record keeping requirements related to those swap transactions and a mandatory clearing and exchange-execution regime for various types, categories or classes of swaps, subject to certain exemptions, including the trade-option and end-user exemptions. Although we anticipate that most, if not all, of our swap transactions should qualify for an exemption to the clearing and exchange-execution requirements, we will still be subject to record keeping and reporting requirements. Other changes to the Commodity Exchange Act made as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the CFTC's implementing regulations could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps.

Interest Rate Risk 
  As described in "Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview" above, on September 1, 2016 we issued   $400 million   in   5.50%   senior notes due 2024. In addition, we currently have a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility with borrowings of approximately   $1.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at either (a) a base rate, which will be a rate equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the U.S. federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (iii) a one-month reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate plus 1.00% or (b) a reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. For loans bearing interest based on the base rate, the applicable margin was initially 1.00%, and for loans bearing interest based on the reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate, the applicable margin was initially 2.00%. After June 25, 2014, the applicable margin ranges from 0.75% to 2.75%, based upon our total leverage ratio and whether we have elected the base rate or the reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate.  
  We do not currently hedge the interest rate risk on our borrowings under the revolving credit facility. However, in the future we may consider hedging the interest rate risk or may consider choosing longer Eurodollar borrowing terms in order to fix all or a portion of our borrowings for a period of time. We estimate that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the debt by   $0.5 million   based on our debt obligations as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Credit Risk 
  We are exposed to credit risk. Credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. We manage our exposure to credit risk associated with customers to whom we extend credit through a credit approval process which includes credit analysis, the establishment of credit limits and ongoing monitoring procedures. We may request letters of credit, cash collateral, prepayments or guarantees as forms of credit support. We have historically experienced only minimal credit losses in connection with our receivables. 
  A substantial majority of our revenue is produced under long-term firm fee contracts with high-quality customers. The customer base we currently serve under these contracts generally has a strong credit profile, with slightly under 50% of our revenues derived from customers who have an investment grade credit rating or are part of corporate families with investment grade credit ratings as of   September 30, 2016  . This represents a decrease in the portion of our revenues derived from customers with an investment grade credit rating from 2015, primarily as a result of credit downgrades at several of our customers and throughout the industry due to the current commodity price environment. 
  We also have indirect credit risk exposure with respect to our investment in Rockies Express. See Item 1A.     Risk Factors for additional information. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a- 15(e) or Rule 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report, and has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms including, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 12.1 
  RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES 
  (in thousands, except ratio data) 
  The table below sets forth the calculation of Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges for the periods indicated. 

(1)   
    TEP closed the acquisition of Trailblazer on April 1, 2014 and the acquisition of a controlling 33.3% membership interest in Pony Express effective September 1, 2014. As the acquisitions of Trailblazer and the initial 33.3% of Pony Express were considered transactions between entities under common control, and changes in reporting entity, financial information presented subsequent to November 13, 2012 and prior to the respective acquisition dates has been recast to include Trailblazer and the initial 33.3% of Pony Express. TEP closed the acquisitions of an additional 33.3% and 31.3% membership interests in Pony Express effective March 1, 2015 and January 1, 2016, respectively, which represent transactions between entities under common control and acquisitions of noncontrolling interests. As a result, financial information for periods prior to March 1, 2015 and January 1, 2016 has not been recast to reflect the additional 33.3% and 31.3% membership interests. 
     
   1 

(2)   
    For purposes of determining the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings are defined as pretax income or loss from continuing operations before earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, plus fixed charges, plus distributed earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, less capitalized interest. Fixed charges consist of interest expensed, capitalized interest, amortization of deferred loan costs, and an estimate of the interest within rental expense.
