Forward-Looking Statements 
  The reports, filings, and other public announcements of Northwest Pipeline LLC, may contain or incorporate by reference statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts. Such statements are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). These forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management s plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions, and other matters.  
  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events, or developments that we expect, believe, or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements.

     Table of Contents  

are beyond our ability to control or predict. Specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 
             
    Availability of supplies and market demand; 
                
    Volatility of pricing including the effect of lower than anticipated energy commodity prices and margins; 
                
    Inflation, interest rates, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on our customers and suppliers); 
                
    The strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition; 
                
    Whether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate, and timely execute our capital projects and other investment opportunities in accordance with our forecasted capital expenditures budget; 
                
    Our ability to successfully expand our facilities and operations;

    Our allocated costs for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans sponsored by our affiliates; 
                
    Changes in maintenance and construction costs; 
                
    Changes in the current geopolitical situation; 
                
    Our exposure to the credit risks of our customers and counterparties; 
                
    Risks related to financing, including restrictions stemming from our debt agreements, future changes in our credit ratings, and the availability and cost of capital; 
                
    Risks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions and physical damage to our facilities; 
                
    Acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions; and 
                
    Additional risks described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
     Given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.    
    
  In addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. Such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. We may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. 
  Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. For a detailed discussion of those factors, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and in Part II, Item 1A.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Northwest Pipeline LLC (Northwest) is indirectly owned by Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ), a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, which is consolidated by The Williams Companies, Inc. (Williams).  On February 2, 2015, WPZ was merged into Access Midstream Partners, L.P. (ACMP), another publicly traded limited partnership consolidated by Williams.  ACMP was the surviving partnership and was subsequently renamed WPZ.  At   September 30, 2016  , Williams holds an approximate 60 percent interest in WPZ, comprised of an approximate 58 percent limited partner interest and all of the 2 percent general partner interest. 
  On September 28, 2015, Williams publicly announced in a press release that it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (Energy Transfer) and certain of its affiliates.  The Merger Agreement provided that, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, Williams would be merged with and into the newly formed Energy Transfer Corp LP (ETC) (ETC Merger), with ETC surviving the ETC Merger.  Energy Transfer formed ETC as a limited partnership that would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Immediately following the completion of the ETC Merger, ETC would contribute to Energy Transfer all of the assets and liabilities of Williams in exchange for the issuance by Energy Transfer to ETC of a number of Energy Transfer Class E common units equal to the number of ETC common shares issued to Williams stockholders in the ETC Merger.  
  On June 29, 2016, Energy Transfer provided Williams written notice terminating the Merger Agreement, citing the alleged failure of certain conditions under the Merger Agreement. 
  In this report, Northwest is at times referred to in the first person as  we,   us,  or  our.  
  General 
  The accompanying interim financial statements do not include all the notes in our annual financial statements, and therefore, should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accompanying unaudited financial statements include all adjustments both normal recurring and others which, in the opinion of our management, are necessary to present fairly our interim financial statements. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted  
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15 "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" (ASU 2016-15).  ASU 2016-15 provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs and distributions received from equity method investees, to reduce diversity in practice.  The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  The new standard requires a retrospective transition.  We are evaluating the impact of the new standard on our financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" (ASU 2016-13).  ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments.  For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking "expected loss" model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses.  The guidance also requires increased disclosures.  The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  The new standard requires varying transition methods for the different categories of amendments.  We are evaluating the impact of the new standard on our financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 "Leases (Topic 842)" (ASU 2016-02).  ASU 2016-02 establishes a comprehensive new lease accounting model.  The new standard clarifies the definition of a lease, requires a dual approach to lease classification similar to current lease classifications, and causes lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset.  The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  The new standard requires a modified retrospective transition for capital or operating leases

existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.  We are evaluating the impact of the new standard on our financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 establishing Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (ASC 606).  ASC 606 establishes a comprehensive new revenue recognition model designed to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services and requires significantly enhanced revenue disclosures.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Deferral of the Effective Date" (ASU 2015-14).  Per ASU 2015-14, the standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  ASC 606 allows either full retrospective or modified retrospective transition and early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  We continue to evaluate both the impact of this new standard on our financial statements and the transition method we will utilize for adoption. 

2. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS 
  Environmental Matters  
  We are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act and other federal and state legislation regulating the environmental aspects of our business. Except as discussed below, our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental requirements. Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending on their future economic benefit and potential for rate recovery. We believe that, with respect to any expenditures required to meet applicable standards and regulations, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) would grant the requisite rate relief so that substantially all of such expenditures would be permitted to be recovered through rates.  
  Beginning in the mid-1980s, we evaluated many of our facilities for the presence of toxic and hazardous substances to determine to what extent, if any, remediation might be necessary.  We identified polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in air compressor systems, soils, and related properties at certain compressor station sites.  Similarly, we identified hydrocarbon impacts at these facilities due to the former use of earthen pits, lubricating oil leaks or spills, and excess pipe coating released to the environment.  In addition, heavy metals have been identified at these sites due to the former use of mercury containing meters and paint and welding rods containing lead, cadmium, and arsenic.  The PCBs were remediated pursuant to a Consent Decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the late 1980s, and we conducted a voluntary clean-up of the hydrocarbon and mercury impacts in the early 1990s.  In 2005, the Washington Department of Ecology required us to re-evaluate our previous clean-ups in Washington.  During 2006 to 2015, 129 meter stations were evaluated, of which 82 required remediation.  As of   September 30, 2016  , all of the meter stations have been remediated.  Initial assessments have been completed at all thirteen compressor stations in Washington.  Additional assessments are ongoing at three of these compressor stations.  Remediation has been completed at ten of the thirteen compressor stations.  On the basis of the findings to date, we estimate that environmental assessment and remediation costs will total approximately $4.7 million, measured on an undiscounted basis, and are expected to be incurred through 2020.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had accrued liabilities totaling approximately $4.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively, for these costs. We are conducting environmental assessments and implementing a variety of remedial measures that may result in increases or decreases in the total estimated costs. 
  In March 2008, the EPA promulgated a new, lower National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone. In May 2012, the EPA completed designation of new eight-hour ozone non-attainment areas.  Based on the published designations, no Northwest facilities are located within the non-attainment areas.  At this time, it is unknown whether future state regulatory actions associated with implementation of the 2008 ozone standard will impact our operations and increase the cost of additions to property, plant and equipment.  Until any additional state regulatory actions are proposed, we are unable to estimate the cost of additions that may be required to meet any such new regulation. 
  In December 2014, the EPA proposed to further reduce the ground-level ozone NAAQS from the March 2008 levels and subsequently finalized a rule on October 1, 2015.  We are monitoring the rule's implementation as the reduction will trigger additional federal and state regulatory actions that may impact our operations.  As a result, the cost of additions to property, plant, and equipment is expected to increase.  We are unable at this time to estimate with any certainty the cost of additions that may be required to meet new regulations. 
  On January 22, 2010, the EPA set a new one-hour nitrogen dioxide (NO  2  ) NAAQS.  The effective date of the new NO  2   standard was April 12, 2010.  On January 20, 2012, the EPA determined pursuant to available information that no area in the country is violating the 2010 NO  2   NAAQS, and thus, designated all areas of the country as  unclassifiable/attainment.   Also, at  
  
   6 

     Table of Contents  
    
  NORTHWEST PIPELINE LLC 
  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

that time, the EPA noted its plan to deploy an expanded NO  2   monitoring network beginning in 2013.  However, on October 5, 2012, the EPA proposed a graduated implementation of the monitoring network between January 1, 2014 and January 1, 2017.  Once three years of data are collected from the new monitoring network, the EPA will reassess attainment status with the one-hour NO  2   NAAQS.  Until that time, the EPA or states may require ambient air quality modeling on a case by case basis to demonstrate compliance with the NO  2   standard.  Because we are unable to predict the outcome of the EPA s or states  future assessment using the new monitoring network, we are unable to estimate the cost of additions that may be required to meet this regulation. 
  Other Matters 
  Various other proceedings are pending against us and are considered incidental to our operations. 
  Summary 
  We estimate that for all matters for which we are able to reasonably estimate a range of loss, including those noted above and others that are not individually significant, our aggregate reasonably possible losses beyond amounts accrued for all of our contingent liabilities are immaterial to our expected future annual results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.  These calculations have been made without consideration of any potential recovery from third parties.  We have disclosed all significant matters for which we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. 

3. DEBT AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENT 
  Credit Facility 
  We, along with WPZ and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line  Company, LLC, are party to a credit agreement with aggregate commitments available of $3.5 billion, with up to an additional $500 million increase in aggregate commitments available under certain circumstances.  Total letter of credit capacity available to WPZ under this credit facility is $1.125 billion.  We are able to borrow up to $500 million under this credit facility to the extent not otherwise utilized by the other co-borrowers.  At   September 30, 2016  , no letters of credit have been issued and $1.230 billion of loans to WPZ are outstanding under the credit facility.  
  WPZ participates in a commercial paper program, and WPZ management considers amounts outstanding under this program to be a reduction of available capacity under the credit facility.  The program allows a maximum outstanding amount at any time of $3 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes.  At   September 30, 2016  , WPZ had $2 million of commercial paper outstanding.  
  Retirement of Long-Term Debt 
  In June 2016, we retired our $175.0 million 7 percent senior unsecured notes that matured on June 15, 2016.  These notes were retired with proceeds from the repayment of advances to WPZ. 
  Long-Term Debt Due Within One Year 
  The long-term debt due within one year at   September 30, 2016   is associated with the $185 million 5.95 percent senior unsecured notes that mature on April 15, 2017. 

4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value: 
  Cash and advances to affiliate   The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. 
  Long-term debt   The disclosed fair value of our long-term debt, which we consider as a level 2 measurement, is determined by a market approach using broker quoted indicative period-end bond prices. The quoted prices are based on observable transactions in less active markets for our debt or similar instruments. The carrying amount and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including current maturities, were $519.0 million and $552.8 million, respectively, at   September 30, 2016  , and $693.4 million and $721.9 million, respectively, at   December 31, 2015  .

5. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES 
  We are a participant in WPZ s cash management program. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the advances due to us by WPZ totaled approximately   $51.7 million   and   $171.9 million  , respectively. These advances are represented by demand notes and are classified as   Current Assets   in the accompanying Balance Sheet. The interest rate on these intercompany demand notes is based upon the daily overnight investment rate paid on WPZ s excess cash at the end of each month, which was approximately 0.27 percent at   September 30, 2016  . The interest income from these advances was minimal during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . Such interest income is included in   Other (Income) and Other Expenses     Miscellaneous other (income) expenses, net   on the accompanying Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
  We have no employees. Services necessary to operate our business are provided to us by Williams and certain affiliates of Williams. We reimburse Williams and its affiliates for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments made (including salary, bonus, incentive compensation, and benefits) in connection with these services. Employees of Williams also provide general administrative and management services to us, and we are charged for certain administrative expenses incurred by Williams. These charges are either directly identifiable or allocated to our assets. Direct charges are for goods and services provided by Williams at our request. Allocated charges are based on a three-factor formula, which considers revenues; property, plant, and equipment; and payroll. In management s estimation, the allocation methodologies used are reasonable and result in a reasonable allocation to us of our costs of doing business incurred by Williams. We were billed $22.8 million and $68.9 million in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and $24.1 million and $74.5 million in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, for these services. Such expenses are primarily included in   General and administrative   and   Operation and maintenance   expenses on the accompanying Statement of Comprehensive Income.  The amount billed to us for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   includes $2.0 million recognized in the first quarter for severance and other related costs associated with a reduction in workforce. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we declared and paid cash distributions to our parent of   $131.0 million   and   $129.0 million  , respectively.  During October   2016  , we declared and paid an additional cash distribution of $43.0 million to our parent. 
  We have entered into various other transactions with certain related parties, the amounts of which were not significant. These transactions and the above-described transactions are made on the basis of commercial relationships and prevailing market prices or general industry practices. 
   
  6. OTHER 
  Our   Asset retirement obligations   in   Total other noncurrent liabilities   on our Balance Sheet reflects a   $21.5   million decrease for 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.  This decrease is primarily due to changes in estimates of existing obligations as a result of our annual review process.  The annual review process considers various factors including inflation rates, current estimates for removal cost, discount rates, and the estimated remaining life of assets.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

GENERAL 
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Management s Discussion and Analysis, Financial Statements, and Notes contained in Items 7 and 8 of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K and with the Financial Statements and Notes contained in this Form 10-Q. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Analysis of Financial Results  
  This analysis discusses financial results of our operations for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Variances due to changes in natural gas prices and transportation volumes have little impact on revenues, because under our rate design methodology, the majority of overall cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in our transportation rates. 
  Our operating revenues increased $0.8 million in the first   nine   months of   2016   as compared with the first   nine   months of   2015  .  This increase is primarily associated with an extra day of business in 2016, due to leap year.  Transportation service accounted for 97 percent and 98 percent, respectively, and gas storage service accounted for 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of our operating revenues for the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 
  Operating expenses increased $2.6 million, or 1 percent, due primarily to an increase in pipeline maintenance of $5.7 million;   $2.0 million in severance and other related costs, recorded in the first quarter, associated with a reduction in workforce; and higher depreciation of $0.8 million, resulting from property additions; partially offset by decreased charges for corporate administrative services of $5.7 million. 
  Financing 
  We intend to utilize our availability under the WPZ credit facility or access to the capital markets to refinance the $185 million, 5.95 percent senior unsecured notes that mature on April 15, 2017. 
  Capital Expenditures 
  Our capital expenditures were   $51.1 million   and   $50.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our capital expenditures estimate for   2016   is discussed in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
  Our management, including our Senior Vice President West and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act) (Disclosure Controls) or our internal control over financial reporting (Internal Controls) will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We monitor our Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls and make modifications as necessary; our intent in this regard is that the Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls will be modified as systems change and conditions warrant. 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls was performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Senior Vice President West and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Senior Vice President West and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that these Disclosure Controls are effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes during the   third   quarter of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
