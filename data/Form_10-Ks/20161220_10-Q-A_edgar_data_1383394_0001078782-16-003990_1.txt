  NOTES TO INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
   
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
   
  (Unaudited   Prepared by Management)  
   
  NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Organization   -  TransAct Energy Corp. ( the Company ) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 15, 2006. The Company is in the business of developing and managing zero emission waste optimization plants globally. The Company has generated nominal revenues and is considered a development stage company as defined in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic No. 915. The Company has, at the present time, not paid any dividends and any dividends that may be paid in the future will depend upon the financial requirements of the Company and other relevant factors. 
   
  Interim Condensed Financial Statements -  The accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows at September 30, 2016 and 2015 and for the periods then ended have been made. 
   
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s December 31, 2015 unaudited financial statements.  The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents -  The Company considers all highly liquid debt investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  
   
  Software and related amortization   -  Software is recorded at cost and the Company provides for amortization using the straight line method over three years. 
   
  Income Taxes -  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic No. 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes.   
   
 The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic No. 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes , on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of ASC Topic No. 740, the Company recognized approximately no increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. 
   
 The Company has no tax positions at June 30, 2016 and 2015 for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. 
   
 The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized no interest and penalties. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. All tax years starting with 2008 are open for examination. 
   
  Loss Per Share -  The computation of loss per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period presented in accordance with ASC Topic No. 260,  Earnings Per Share  [See Note 9].  
   
  Accounting Estimates   -  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated by management. 

9 

NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  
   
  Recently Enacted Accounting Standards   -  In September 2009 the FASB established the Accounting Standards Codification ( Codification  or  ASC ) as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ). Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) issued under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of GAAP for SEC registrants.  Existing GAAP was not intended to be changed as a result of the Codification, and accordingly the change did not impact our financial statements. The ASC does change the way the guidance is organized and presented. 
   
 Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU No. 2009-05 (ASC Topic 820), which amends Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   Overall, ASU No. 2009-13 (ASC Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, ASU No. 2009-14 (ASC Topic 985), Certain Revenue Arrangements that include Software Elements, and various other ASU s No. 2009-2 through ASU No. 2011-8 which contain technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance to specialized industries or entities were recently issued. These updates have no current applicability to the Company or their effect on the financial statements would not have been significant. 
   
  Foreign Currency Translation   -  The Financial statements are presented in United States dollars. In accordance with ASC 830  Foreign Currency Matters , foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into their United States dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates which prevailed at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rate of exchange during the year. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operation. 
   
  Stock Offering Costs -  Costs incurred in connection with stock offerings will be deferred and offset against the proceeds of the stock offering.  Costs incurred in connection with unsuccessful offerings will be expensed. 
   
  Reclassification    Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

 The $12,000, $5,000, $7,000, $212,000 and $12,520 loans receivable from a company whose sole shareholder holds less than 10% in TransAct, are secured and were due on November 1, November 10, November 29, December 6 and December 6, 2010, respectively. The loans are secured by certain assets and equipment of the company and bear interest at rates between 15% and 18% per annum for the terms of the loans. At June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 interest receivable was $50,954. These notes have not been granted an extension, are in default and management has formally demanded payment of the outstanding principal and interest and may pursue legal action if the cost of said action can be justified. At December 31, 2010 the Company recorded a total allowance of $299,475 charged to operations including principal of $248,521 and interest of $50,954.

  NOTE 7   GOING CONCERN  
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.  However, the Company has a working capital deficit and has incurred losses since its inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. In this regard, management is proposing to raise any necessary additional funds not provided by operations through loans and/or through additional sales of its common stock. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising this additional capital or in achieving profitable operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

NOTE 10   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)  
   
  Consulting Agreement- On May 3, 2012 the company entered into an agreement whereby 3,015,000 free trading shares are to be issued in exchange for a $20,000 advance to TransAct and the settlement of any and all obligations given to the parties of the agreement. These shares are intended to be sold to cover their costs including the advances and any balance of these shares not used in settlement would be used to raise capital and split evenly between the parties. The portion that goes to the consulting company will be expensed as consulting fees. In order to facilitate the terms of this agreement the Company by way of special resolution identified certain shareholders of the Company that had sufficient unrestricted common shares and agreed to replace the unrestricted shares with restricted common shares plus an incentive of an additional 10% of bonus shares.  
   
 In May 30, 2012 the Company issued 3,316,500 common shares, including 301,500 bonus shares, valued at $.036 per share. In June 2014 the company returned the original $20,000.  
   
  Loan Agreement -Pursuant to an Agreement on June 28 th , 2012 that was extended to August 31, 2012 and then on Aug 30 th , 2012 to November 15 th , 2012, and is now extended to May 15, 2014; where originally on May 11, 2012 the Company arranged for 3,005,000 free trading shares to be placed as additional security for a $100,000 loan as a retainer for a financing of 100 million dollars. TransAct had a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to receive one third or 30 million dollars of this financing. The financing was not completed. If these shares are used to repay the loan TransAct will have to issue the shares used plus 10% additional shares to the contributing shareholders and expense whatever shares used as financing costs.  
   
  Share-purchase Agreement    On January 30, 2014 the Company entered a share-purchase agreement for shares in a proposed subsidiary that would own and operate a zero emissions waste optimization plant (Z.E.W.O.P. TM ) in Puebla, Mexico. The agreement provided for the purchaser to own up to 45% of the subsidiary.  The Purchaser advanced $300,000 of the proposed 30% of CAPEX to the Company to facilitate a phase one engineering review. With a positive outcome to the review the Company has now formed the subsidiary in question Puebla ZEWOP 1 and is formalizing the share purchase agreement between our wholly owned subsidiary TransAct Mexico and the Puebla Waste Consortium ( PWC ).  
   
 The Puebla ZEWOP 1 share purchase agreement was not updated and the terms of the original agreement have not been fulfilled by the consortium resulting in the termination of the same. The subsidiary is currently not committed to build and operate a 1320 tonne per day Z.E.W.O.P. TM  estimated at $320 Million USD. The Company has a receivable due from the subsidiary at December 31, 2014 of $96,755.  
   
  Consulting Agreement- On August 20 th , 2014 the company entered into an Engineering Services Agreement to facilitate the design/build of the proprietary reactors for the Puebla, MX Zero Emissions Waste Optimization Plant. The estimated cost of the contract is $450,000 over the next 12 months, out of pocket reimbursements, cost plus 10% on all material and outside labor and a stock bonus of 150,000 common shares upon completion of the scope of work. This agreement will be amended to reflect the new location of the plant.  All amounts under the agreement are current  
   
  Subscription Agreement-  Pursuant to an Agreement on September 27 th , 2014 the company agreed to sell restricted securities of the Company in the form of common stock upon receipt of three tranches of capital equaling $1,200,000 each. The common stock is to be sold for $0.50 for the first tranche of 2,400,000 shares and is due in the week of September 28, 2014, $1.00 for the second tranche of 1,200,000 shares and is due in the week of March 1, 2015, $1.50 for the third tranche of 800,000 shares due in August 2 nd , 2015. To date the first tranche has not been paid in and the agreement is not reflected on the balance sheet. February 2015 the subscribers of $3.6 Million dollars of our common stock advised us they would be unable to fulfill their commitment under the restricted securities agreement. We have received the same in writing and agreed to a settlement with the parties involved where they purchase 526,316 common shares @ $0.19. To date $12,440 has been received of the agreed $100,000. Under the terms of the agreement the funds received as of December 2015 have been treated as forfeited and the settlement agreement terminated. We are now entitled to exercise any punitive rites of the original agreement.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT NOTICE  
   
 This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  For this purpose, any statements contained in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.  Without limiting the foregoing, words such as  may,   will,   expect,   believe,   anticipate,   estimate  or  continue  or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control.  These factors include but are not limited to economic conditions generally and in the industries in which we may participate; competition within our chosen industry, including competition from much larger competitors; technological advances and failure to successfully develop business relationships. 
   
  OUR BUSINESS  
   
 We formed TransAct Energy Corp. as a Nevada corporation on March 15, 2006. Although our business plan called for the securing and managing of any energy leasehold, the Company focused on securing producing and non-producing oil and gas leases in Alberta, Canada. On September 7, 2006, we acquired a one hundred percent (100%) interest in a Petroleum and Natural Gas Lease, from the province of Alberta, Canada for twelve thousand and fifty-one dollars ($12,051), the MedHat Project. We did not develop this resource. We looked to expand our holdings in Alberta through acquisitions and joint ventures for the following two years. We have since allowed this lease to lapse and moved away from this focus. 
   
 A distinct trend appeared in the energy sector supporting sustainable energies. About the same time in late 2008 the Company was introduced to Dr. Mory Ghomshei one of the world s leading geothermal experts and two of his geothermal power projects in British Columbia, Canada. The acquisition, resource evaluation, exploration process and administration for geothermal are very similar and in many jurisdictions come under the petroleum sector. We worked with independent companies Aqua Terra Power and Aqua Terra Geothermal through the balance of 2009 on the two geothermal power projects in British Columbia. Other than lending Aqua Terra funds no formal arrangement was entered pending them securing drill permits on the two projects. These licenses lapsed under their original owners and were re-posted by the government for public tender; an Ontario corporation associated with Dr. Ghomshei acquired most of the original licences and have initiated drilling applications. We entered discussions with this entity in the latter half of 2011 to form a Farm-in relationship. We have put these discussions on hold pending the completion of our first operating plants in the Waste Optimization Division although we are maintaining dialogue with Dr. Ghomshei as it relates to utilizing Geothermal in the plants themselves. 
   
 TransAct in mid-2009 started introducing the concept of geothermal power to markets in Western and South Asia with the plan to enter joint venture relationships to develop geothermal power projects in these areas. To enter these markets as a power producer the Company found it strategic to develop traditional carbon fuelled power projects in addition. After discussions with the Republic of Iraq regarding geothermal opportunities in Northern Iraq, the Company, together with Spectrum Energy Project Investments (a UAE power company), submitted applications to the Basra Investment Commission to develop/manage three natural gas power plants. These multi-billion dollar projects come with long-term power purchase agreements (PPA) and sovereign guarantees and our application through Spectrum was shortlisted. We were unsuccessful in completing our acquisition of 50% of Spectrum and the initial offering lapsed.  
   
 On August 31, 2009, TransAct Energy completed and closed its initial public offering at twenty-five cents ($0.25) per share selling one million one hundred and two thousand shares (1,102,000) for a total capital raise of two-hundred and seventy-four thousand three hundred and ninety-eight dollars ($274,398 USD). Most these funds were placed with Aqua Terra Power as convertible notes to secure and develop the four (4) geothermal licenses in British Columbia, Canada; the balance was used to pay the costs of the offering and a small amount went to working capital. The Company was approved for listing on the OTCBB in December 2009 and received the trading symbol  TEGY.   
   
 Throughout 2010 we laid the ground work for large power projects in South Europe, Asia and Africa; smaller projects for solar, waste to energy and hydrogen fuel cells specifically in India.  We worked to secure markets for geothermal, new solar photo-voltaic, waste to energy and hydrogen fuel cell generators.  
   
 Joint development agreement negotiations took place in December 2010 clearing the way for Transact to enter one major project in South East Asia in 2011.  This project was stalled throughout 2011 because TransAct was unable to secure the funds it required to proceed. 

16 

The 2011 year was frustrated with the company s inability to collect raised or earned funds into the company s bank account. Thus projects, joint ventures and previous efforts were postponed or lost permanently. While we did maintain the company s trading status the year was taken up with collection efforts and supporting business relationships while in limbo. We did initiate discussions on new waste to energy technologies to leverage the work we had done previously in this sector. 
   
 The Company s 2012 efforts were focused on building out its Waste Optimization division.  We completed a Business Plan for this division and entered a Joint Development Agreement with the owners of a small scale, proprietary, zero emissions waste optimization plant ( ZEWOP ) that had been operating a 20 tonne per day plant for two years. We reconnected with clients in India and Brazil for future waste optimization opportunities.  From the second quarter, through to the end of 2012 we worked to raise the necessary funds to build a municipal scale plant (500 tonnes per day) in Scotland.  
   
 2013 continued as a building year for both the company and its Waste Optimization division. We completed the acquisition of the ZEWOP technology from the Scottish Inventor and brought him on as a long-term member of our team. We successfully negotiated a relationship with the international firm Fichtner Consulting Engineers to complete the certification of our plants going forward. We identified suppliers of waste for the proposed United Kingdom plants, initiated the relationships for the uptake of the Natural Gas and Electricity in the United Kingdom and tentatively sourced the capital required for the first plant in the United Kingdom. Globally we negotiated the intent to build a plant in Mexico that includes the required equity and waste. In Brazil, we initiated a relationship to create a green energy fund to grow both the market in Brazil and the other strategic areas of South America. Initial talks have taken place with potential development partners for a few of the major Brazil markets pending the success of the UK or Mexico plant. In the USA and China, we are in talks with potential development partners that can deliver significant capital/waste and see our technology as the best solution going forward. 
   
 Throughout 2014 TransAct worked to finalize the engineering review and agreements necessary to develop the first Zero Emissions Waste Optimization Plants  TM  (Z.E.W.O.P.  TM ) in Puebla, Mexico. The plant under design is capable of processing 1320 metric tons per day of Municipal Solid Waste ( MSW ) and is estimated to cost approximately three hundred million dollars. In late November Fichtner Consulting Engineers reported they believed the Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  could process the MSW 100% into useable products without emissions. The Fichtner report provided TransAct the opportunity to submit the Waste Supply Agreement to the Municipality of Puebla, prepare off-take agreements for interested buyers of the Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  products and formalize the share purchase agreement with the Puebla Waste Consortium ( PWC ).  PWC intended on providing 30% of the capital required to build the Z.E.W.O.P.  TM , while TransAct negotiates third party lenders for the remaining 70% of the cost through debt instruments.  
   
 The Company delivered the results of the Fichtner Report to the Puebla City Staff in December of 2014. The cost of the plant was more than originally discussed because it included garbage pre-processing and their waste contained more water. This affected the required equity and although it was never stated appears to be cause of the PWC hesitation. We also found out subsequently there was legal wrangling and back room negotiations between the existing MSW concession holders and the municipal/state government, affecting their ability to sign with us.  After 6 months with no movement forward for the MSW feedstock from the City of Puebla,   Management set out in 2015 to secure an alternate source of MSW. After reviewing and discussing several alternative municipalities we are now negotiating the details of an MSW supply agreement. The agreement we had with the Puebla Waste Consortium is terminated however the sales efforts were all to National/International companies whose interest in our products will not change with a change in location. The one hundred-million-dollar equity for the plant in Puebla disappeared with the termination of the consortium contract. An alternative source of the plant equity is being sought during 2015 with a variety of investors coming forward during this period. As soon as we finalize the feed-stock and sales contracts we will seek to formalize the required equity. 
   
 Because of the specialized nature of many of the Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  components, we initiated some of the equipment procurement; as a result, we entered a design/supply agreement for our proprietary reactors with a specialized engineering firm. 
   
 2014 saw the Company form subsidiary corporations in Ireland and Mexico. In Ireland, we established the wholly owned subsidiary  TransAct Energy Global Ltd , this company will in turn wholly own each national subsidiary. The first national subsidiary of TransAct Global is  TransAct Energy Mexico  which will own a majority shareholding of each holding company that owns a Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  like  Puebla ZEWOP 1 .  
   
 At the beginning of 2015 we focused on finalizing the sale of the anticipated Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  products. These efforts included getting signed letters of intent from qualified buyers and preparing formal legal agreements for the same. We now have letters of intent from multiple qualified buyers for all of the expected product and agreements ready to be signed subject to finalizing our feed-stock agreement (Waste Supply Agreement) for the first plant.  

17 

In summary 2015 s efforts focused on completing the due-diligence for the Mexican candidate feed-stocks including matching equity partners and buyers of the resulting products. To that end we now have several feed-stock agreements to negotiate through to a final agreement or dismiss depending on the outcome of the negotiations. The potential equity partners have been identified subject to finalizing the feed-stock agreement and pre-sales of the future products. The clients that signed letters of intent for the products have also been briefed on the potential feed-stock cities to re-confirm their commitment. Every effort was made during the year to keep the candidate banks for debt financing informed of our progress and they appear to be continuing with their support.  
   
 The first quarter of 2016 we focused on negotiating four specific opportunities for MSW feed-stock in the greater Guadalajara area, the greater Mexico City region and the greater Puebla region of Mexico. We are now providing written proposals directly to two cities, waiting for a proposal in writing from a private contractor to process its contracted MSW and waiting for the other private group to secure their long-term contract from Mexico City. Each opportunity will satisfy our need for thirteen-hundred and twenty metric tons per day of MSW feed-stock before we can start our first municipal scale Z.E.W.O.P.  TM.   
   
 Throughout April into May 2016 we prepared and submitted formal proposals to two different municipalities in Mexico as requested, where TransAct provided a complete MSW management solution including, collection, transportation and processing. One of the Cities is now preparing a request for proposal (RFP) supposedly based around our zero emissions proposal the other wants us to initiate discussions with some of the stakeholders (unions) prior to moving forward. We have strategic partners in Mexico capable of covering the transportation.  
   
 In June we met with a private, established, Mexico City municipal contractor after providing them with a memorandum of understanding regarding processing fifteen hundred metric tonnes per day. We have come to a preliminary agreement to proceed to a formal agreement, that will include a long-term feed-stock agreement for our Z.E.W.O.P. TM , and the purchase of a development site with some environmental approvals related to waste management already in place. This agreement when completed should strategically launch TransAct in the Mexican market.  
   
 We were also invited in May to provide a proposal to the Republic of Panama and submitted a letter of intent covering a waste management strategy using Z.E.W.O.P.  TM . This has supposedly been reviewed at the highest level of government and been approved for ministerial signature. We await receipt of the signed MOU before proceeding. 
   
 Throughout the third quarter of 2016 we were forced to wait for the Mexico City group to work through the nuances of our tentative agreement which included, extending their MSW concession to cover the thirty-year period we asked for, insuring compliance with SAMARNAT (federal environmental agency) and completing their legal reviews. We have been advised that they will soon be ready to move forward with us. During this same period the other municipality in the state of Jalisco continued to prepare their request for proposal expecting to release the same in the last quarter of 2016. Discussions continued in South and Central America, with proposals being tabled with the government in Paraguay, follow up meetings in Rio De Janeiro and Panama.  
   
  PLAN OF OPERATION  
   
 TransAct Energy Corp. has elected to focus entirely on the global development and dissemination of its zero emissions waste optimization plants (Z.E.W.O.P.  TM).   The Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  makes ecological, economic, cultural and social sense. Becoming an engine that supports the circular economy in any community it enters sustainably. Municipalities can now be paid instead of paying to manage their MSW. 
   
 Our near-term strategy going forward is too exploit the work and relationships that have been established in Mexico.  Despite the delays and setbacks of Puebla our efforts will continue throughout 2016 to finalize the Waste Supply Agreement in a large Mexican market, signing off on 75-80% of our product sales under off-take agreements and initiating the engineering review of our selected site for the plant in Mexico. These agreements completed should lead to the financing commitment we have been seeking for the $200 Million (+/-) debt portion of the first Z.E.W.O.P. TM . In 2016 we should be able to complete the Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  building/plant design and initiate the permit/permission application process. Simultaneously we intend to work through an EPC contract and its related subcontracts. TransAct hopes to establish manufacturing of our proprietary reactors in Mexico to supply the demand for both Mexico and the USA.  Subject to our funding draw down schedule and the permit/permission process we intend on constructing the Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  buildings in early 2017. Provided all equipment manufacturers can supply their components we intend on assembling the plant through 2017 and initiating commissioning the beginning of 2018.  
   
 Once TransAct is confident the development of the first Z.E.W.O.P. TM  is well underway it will proceed with the scheduling and planning of additional plants. This will include our first European Z.E.W.O.P.  TM.   South America, including Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina have generated multiple opportunities for Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  including the capital required to develop these opportunities. We intend on continuing to work these opportunities to secure a foothold in these markets.  

18 

Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  can demonstrate to Mexico and the World a municipal scale solution to managing waste without emissions and land filling. Although we have been approached to build in the other North American cities we feel the market is best approached when the first Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  is fully operational to garner government agency support. This will insure a smoother entry into the other North American markets, once we break ground we will make sure major municipalities throughout the US and Canada are aware of our process so we get on the technology review lists. 
   
 Besides finding capital for individual projects, until the first revenues from operations come in, our corporate operations will continue to be funded by raising money through private placements or public offerings. We anticipate bringing on an expanded management team to oversee our operational growth throughout this year and plan on raising additional capital as required. The first $3.6 Million of this budgeted capital should come in after the signing of the Waste Supply Agreement in 2016. 
   
 For the balance of the 2016 year the Company s focus is to:  

1) 
   Secure working capital for the Company significant enough to maintain accounts payable at a current status and fund day to day corporate costs through to cash-flow from first operations, including expansion of corporate management team in order facilitate global dissemination of Z.E.W.O.P.  TM ; 

2) 
   Complete the development of the Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  in Mexico as follows; 

a) 
   Finalize waste supply agreement, share purchase, Product Purchase Agreements; 
  
        b) 
   Secure all required permits and permissions;  
  
        c) 
   Finalize debt portion of plant cost; 
  
        d) 
   Complete EPC contracts and supplier agreements; 
  
        e) 
   Initiate site development, construction and assembly of plant. 

3) 
   Initiate second Mexico Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  contracts in order to launch development in 2017. 

4) 
   Continue with European market entrance towards end of 2016.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
   
 As of September 30, 2016, our current assets are $206,320 made up of prepaid expenses of $109,264, receivables of $96,755 and $301 cash on hand. Our current liabilities consist of accounts payable in the amount of $311,473, accrued interest of $1,709,750, compensation payable of $1,477,279 and Notes payable, net of any discount of $243,245. 
   
  NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING  
   
 We estimate our upcoming operating expenses to increase substantially as we transcend from development stage to operating stage and could be as much as $4,000,000.00 per year or more. We have conditional commitments through our subsidiaries for capital expenditures related to the first plant in Mexico and anticipate entering further commitments to secure additional plants going forwards. We believe we will need additional funds to cover our expenses and commitments for the next twelve months. Our need for capital may change dramatically as we pursue our business plan during that period. Further, we cannot assure that we will be successful in consummating business opportunities on favourable terms or we will be able to profitably manage any business opportunities. Should we require additional capital, we may seek additional advances from officers, sell common stock or find other forms of debt financing.  
   
 As per our previously filed 8K the Company raised $3.6 Million in capital to cover the next fourteen months to expected cash flow from our Z.E.W.O.P.  TM  in Mexico. This financing fell through; however we fully intend on replacing it which may result in further dilution of shares.  
   
 There is no guarantee the Company will not need to raise further significant capital over the next year, some of which may need to be done by way of selling equity in the Company. Depending on the market price and the terms that can be negotiated this will result in the dilution of current shareholders of the Company s stock.

  ITEM 4T. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  
   
 (a) 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). We are committed to maintaining disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
   
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures and implementing controls and procedures.  
   
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report.   
   
 (b) 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting .  There were no changes in the Company's internal controls or procedures over financial reporting, known to the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

 Up to the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company worked diligently on its business and maintaining its reporting status with the SEC. However due to finances we were forced to file our Annual Report without auditors review t he company is delinquent in required filings with the SEC as determined by the NASD.  Because of filing unaudited statements and changes to the over the counter bulletin board ( OTCBB ) we were downgraded from the OTCQB to the OTC Pinks. When we amend our filings to include audited statements for 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 we can reapply to the OTCBB for a OTCQB listing.
