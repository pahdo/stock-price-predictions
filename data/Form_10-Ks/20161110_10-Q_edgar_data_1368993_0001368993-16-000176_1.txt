NOTE 1.  The Company 
    
  General     WaferGen Bio-systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) are engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of systems for genomic technology solutions for single-cell analysis and clinical research. The Company s ICELL8  Single-Cell System is a cutting edge platform that can isolate thousands of single cells and process specific cells for analysis, including Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ). The Company s SmartChip  platform can be used for profiling and validating molecular biomarkers, and can perform massively parallel singleplex PCR for one-step target enrichment and library preparation for clinical NGS. The Company s Apollo 324  system can be used to process DNA and RNA from clinical samples to NGS-ready libraries. The Company s products are aimed at researchers who perform genetic analysis, primarily at pharmaceutical and biotech companies, academic and private research centers and diagnostics companies involved in biomarker discovery and genetic research. Through the SmartChip and Apollo product lines, the Company plans to provide new performance standards with significant savings in time and cost for professionals in the field of gene expression research and to facilitate biomarker discovery, toxicology and clinical research. 
    
  Wafergen, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 22, 2002, and was acquired by WaferGen Bio-systems, Inc. in a reverse merger on May 31, 2007. 
    
  On August 30, 2011, the Company formed a new wholly owned subsidiary in Luxembourg to establish a presence for its marketing and research activities in Europe. 

NOTE 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation     The Company has prepared the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to these rules and regulations. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and footnotes related thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , included in the Company s Form 10-K filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position and the results of its operations and cash flows. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
    
  Basis of Consolidation     The condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of WaferGen Bio-systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant transactions and balances between the WaferGen Bio-systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  Use of Estimates     Preparing condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions. 
    
  Foreign Currencies     Foreign exchange gains and losses for assets and liabilities of the Company s non-U.S. subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are recorded in miscellaneous income (expense) in the Company s statement of operations. The Company has no subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency. 
    
  Accounts Receivable     An allowance for doubtful accounts will be recorded based on a combination of historical experience, aging analysis, and information on specific accounts. Account balances will be written off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. 
    
  Inventory     Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Additionally, the Company evaluates its inventory in terms of excess and obsolete exposures and records provisions as needed. 
    
  Goodwill and Long-lived Intangible Assets     Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Impairment losses, if any, are recorded in the statement of operations as  impairment of goodwill  within operating expenses.

  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Long-lived intangibles are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and are subject to review for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Amortization is recognized over the estimated useful life of the respective asset on a straight-line basis except for customer lists, which are amortized in proportion to the present value of projected cash flows within their estimated useful lives, since this methodology more closely reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are derived. 
    
  Revenue Recognition     The Company recognizes revenue when (i) delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered, (ii) there is persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement, (iii) selling prices are fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability from the customers (individual customers and distributors) is reasonably assured. Revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from the sale of the Company s products. Revenue is recorded when the risk and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Company s customers. This generally occurs when the Company s products are shipped from its facility as title has passed. Revenue is recorded net of estimated cash discounts. The Company estimates and accrues an allowance for sales returns at the time the product is sold. To date, sales returns have not been material. 
    
  Revenue from multi-deliverable arrangements is recognized for each element on delivery of product or completion of service. A typical multi-deliverable arrangement would be the shipment of capital equipment to a customer, followed by the delivery of services or of expendable equipment, provided such delivery is both probable and substantially within the Company s control. Revenue for each deliverable is allocated based on full list selling prices, although if none of the deliverables is disproportionately discounted relative to the overall discount, this allocation is approximated by using the actual selling price of each deliverable to the customer. The actual cost of revenue for each deliverable is recognized when the revenue for that deliverable is recognized. 
    
  Governmental Subsidies     Incentives received from governments in the form of grants are recorded as a reduction in expense in accordance with their purpose. Grants awarded for the purpose of matching specified expenditures are not recognized until a definitive agreement has been signed by both parties; thereafter income is recognized to the extent that the related expenses have been incurred. The Company recognized   no   governmental subsidies in the   three months ended September 30,     2016   or   2015  , or in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , the balance of available matching funds having been fully used by March 31, 2015, and recognized   $164,000   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  , which was offset against operating expenses in the statement of operations. 
    
  Stock-Based Compensation     The Company measures the fair value of all stock-based awards to employees, including stock options, on the grant date and records the fair value of these awards, net of estimated forfeitures, to compensation expense over the service period. The fair value of awards to consultants is measured on the dates on which performance of services is completed, with interim valuations recorded at balance sheet dates while performance is in progress. The fair value of options is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and of restricted stock is based on the Company s closing share price on the measurement date. 
    
  Change in Fair Value of Derivatives     The Company recognizes (or recognized until the time of their settlement) its warrants with certain cash settlement provisions or with certain anti-dilution protection as derivative liabilities. Such liabilities are valued when the financial instruments are initially issued or the derivative first requires recognition and are also revalued at each reporting date, with the change in their respective fair values being recorded as a gain or loss on revaluation within other income and expenses in the statement of operations. The Company determines the fair value of those warrants for which no anti-dilution adjustment is projected prior to the expiration date using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and all other derivative liabilities using a Monte Carlo Simulation approach, with key input variables provided by management. 
    
  Warranty Reserve     The Company s standard warranty agreement is   one   year from shipment of certain products. The Company accrues for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment of these products. The Company s warranty reserve is based on management s judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and associated repair costs, and is updated quarterly. 
    
  Net Income (Loss) Per Share     Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus common share equivalents from conversion of dilutive stock options, warrants, and restricted stock using the treasury method, and convertible securities using the as-converted method, except when antidilutive. In the event of a net loss, the effects of all potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation as their inclusion would be antidilutive.

Reclassification     Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods  data to conform to the current presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported net losses. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance within U.S. GAAP. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will be required to make certain judgments and estimates, including identifying contract performance obligations, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price among separate performance obligations. Further, ASU 2014-09 will require companies to make additional disclosures. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, and will become effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017, with early adoption not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective date  ( ASU 2015-14 ),which permits deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year, so the Company may delay adopting the standard until January 1, 2018. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations  ( ASU 2016-08 ), in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ) and in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ). ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 all update and clarify the guidance previously issued in ASU 2014-09 and will become effective for the Company when it adopts ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09, as amended, allows for   two   methods of adoption, a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is in the process of determining both the timing and the method of adoption and its impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Topic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 will add guidance to U.S. GAAP that is presently available only in auditing standards, and provide clarification of such guidance. Further, an assessment of going concern will be required at each interim reporting period (in addition to the existing auditing guideline of an annual assessment), and will require a look-forward period of one year from the date of issuance (as opposed to the existing auditing guideline of   one   year from the balance sheet date). ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted, and will become effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2016, and for each interim period thereafter. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 requires the recognition of lease assets (representing the value of the right to use the property over the lease term) and lease liabilities (representing the present value of future liabilities) by lessees for those leases presently classified as operating leases (superseding the previous requirement that they be expensed over the lease term, without recognition of assets and liabilities). ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, and will become effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019. The Company is in the process of determining the impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 permits entities to make an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur when recognizing the expense of share-based compensation (as opposed to the existing requirement to use estimated forfeitures), reduces the tax withholding threshold at which equity accounting is permitted for shares withheld on vesting and requires that payments by an employer when withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes be reported as financing activities within the statement of cash flows, along with guidance related to excess tax benefits. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016, without electing to change its existing accounting policy of accounting for forfeitures based on expected vesting, and its adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the required presentation and classification in the

statement of cash flows for various issues for which there has been diversity in practice in the past. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard effective July 1, 2016, and its adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

NOTE 5.  Long Term Obligations 
    
  On August 15, 2013, the Company issued WaferGen Biosystems (M) Sdn. Bhd. ( WGBM ), a wholly owned subsidiary in Malaysia, notes with a face value of   $6.6 million  , maturing on   August 15, 2020   (the  Malaysian Notes ), in consideration of WGBM s cancellation of the Company s obligations under a term loan owing to WGBM which, as of that date, had an outstanding loan balance of approximately   $5.3 million  . Under the terms of an agreement between the Company, WGBM and Malaysian Technology Development Corporation Sdn. Bhd. ( MTDC,  a major investor in WGBM s preference shares), upon liquidation of WGBM (which occurred on November 26, 2013), the Malaysian Notes were divided such that the Company received notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $1.4 million   and MTDC received notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $5.2 million   (the  MTDC Notes ). The MTDC Notes were recorded using an effective interest rate of   17.39%   and are summarized as follows at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

At any time prior to the MTDC Notes  maturity date, the Company may issue to MTDC shares of the Company s common stock with a value, based on the average closing price in the preceding   30   days, equal to the face value of the MTDC Notes. Based on an average closing price of   $0.8400   in the   30   days preceding   September 30, 2016  , the MTDC Notes could have been settled by issuing   6,190,000   shares of the Company s common stock. 
    
  The Company also leases equipment under   three   capital leases that expire between December 2017 and May 2018. Aggregate future minimum obligations for capital leases in effect as of   September 30, 2016  , are as follows: 

NOTE 6.  Preferred Stock 
    
  The Company has   10,000,000   shares of preferred stock authorized. Effective October 20, 2015, the Company designated   1,108   shares as Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock. Each share of Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible into   10,000   shares of common stock, subject to an ownership cap whereby conversion may not occur to the extent the holder would own more than   9.98%   of the common stock following conversion. The Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock has   no   voting rights and is on a par with common stock on an as-converted basis with respect to dividend rights and distributions of assets in the event of liquidation, without regard to the ownership cap.

Awards vested over varying periods, as specified by the Company s Board of Directors for each grant, and are exercisable for a maximum period of   ten   years after date of grant. Both of these plans have been frozen, resulting in no further shares being available for grant.  
    
  The Company presently issues most of its awards under the 2008 Plan, initially adopted by the Company s stockholders on June 5, 2008, and subsequently amended to authorize the issuance of additional shares of the Company s common stock. This includes an amendment adopted by the Company s stockholders on May 25, 2016, which increased the total number of shares authorized for issuance from   1,215,000   to   3,715,000  . The purpose of the 2008 Plan is to provide an incentive to retain the employment of directors, officers, consultants, advisors and employees of the Company, to attract new personnel whose training, experience and ability are considered valuable, to encourage the sense of proprietorship, and to stimulate the active interest of such persons in the Company s development and financial success. Under the 2008 Plan, the Company is authorized to issue incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Awards that expire or are canceled generally become available for issuance again under the 2008 Plan. The number of shares of the Company s common stock available under the 2008 Plan will be subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or other extraordinary dividend, or other similar change in the Company s common stock or capital structure. Awards may vest over varying periods, as specified by the Company s Board of Directors for each grant, and have a maximum term of   seven   years from the grant date. The 2008 Plan is administered by the Company s Board of Directors. 
    
  On January 22, 2016,   292,000   conditional options were issued to the Company s executive chairman (the  January 2016 Conditional Award ). The January 2016 Conditional Award was not covered by the Plans at the time of issuance and was conditional on the Company obtaining stockholder approval to amend the 2008 Plan to authorize at least   2,000,000   additional shares. In the event of failure to receive such stockholder approval by June 30, 2016, the January 2016 Conditional Award would convert into a cash-settled stock appreciation right. Due to the possibility of cash settlement, the January 2016 Conditional Award was initially recorded as a liability, with its fair value updated at each balance sheet date. When stockholder approval to authorize an additional   2,500,000   shares was obtained on May 25, 2016, the January 2016 Conditional Award was revalued at its fair value on that date, since when it has been reflected as an option awarded under the 2008 Plan and has not been subject to revaluation. 
    
  The weighted average grant date fair value of the options awarded in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , measured on the date on which potential cash settlement provisions were eliminated, was estimated to be   $0.59   and   $2.56  , respectively, using grant date closing stock prices ranging from   $0.56   to   $0.99   on the valuation dates in 2016 and   $3.19   to   $3.78   on the award dates in 2015, respectively, and based on the following assumptions:  

The Company has issued both options and restricted stock (including restricted stock units), mostly under the Plans. Restricted stock grants afford the recipient the opportunity to receive shares of common stock, subject to certain terms, whereas options give

them the right to purchase common stock at a set price. Both the Company s options and restricted stock issued to employees generally have vesting restrictions that are eliminated over   three   or   four   years, although vesting may be over a shorter period, or may occur on the grant date, depending on the terms of each individual award.  
    
  A summary of stock option (including conditional options) and restricted stock transactions in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , is as follows: 

No   options were exercised during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   or   2015  . The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable at   September 30, 2016  , was   $172,000   and   $85,000  , respectively, based on the Company s common stock closing price of   $0.85  . Aggregate intrinsic value is the total pretax amount (i.e., the difference between the Company s stock price and the exercise price) that would have been received by the option holders had all their in-the-money options been exercised. 
    
  The amounts expensed for stock-based compensation totaled   $225,000   and   $149,000   for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $979,000   and   $1,108,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the total stock-based compensation cost not yet recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, was   $1,034,000  . This cost is expected to be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of   1.49   years.   No   amounts related to stock-based compensation costs have been capitalized. The tax benefit and the resulting effect on cash flows from operating and financing activities related to stock-based compensation costs were not recognized as the Company currently provides a full valuation allowance for all of its related deferred taxes. 

NOTE 8.  Warrants 
    
  A summary of outstanding common stock warrants as of   September 30, 2016  , is as follows: 

In addition, there are   25.88   unit warrants outstanding, which expire in August and September 2018,   0.35   of which are recorded as liabilities, each entitling the holder to purchase, for   $50,000  ,   2,500   shares of common stock and   1,250   warrants to purchase   one   share of common stock at an exercise price of   $26.00  , expiring in August and September 2018. 
    
  The Company records warrants and unit warrants with certain anti-dilution protection or certain cash settlement provisions as liabilities, with the estimated fair value of those warrants for which   no   anti-dilution adjustment is projected prior to the expiration

date being calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, with all others being calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation approach, using key input variables provided by management, at each reporting date. Changes in fair value are recorded as gains or losses on revaluation in non-operating income (expense). 
    
  The aggregate fair value of those warrants and unit warrants accounted for as liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was estimated to be   $0   and   $18,000  , respectively, using a closing stock price of   $0.85   and   $1.36  , respectively, and based on the following assumptions: 

The aggregate fair value of such warrants and unit warrants at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , was estimated to be   $4,000   and   $126,000  , respectively. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the   decrease   in the fair value of the warrant derivative liability of   $4,000   was recorded as a revaluation   gain  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the   decrease   in the fair value of the warrant derivative liability of   $108,000   was recorded as a revaluation   gain   (see Note 9). 

NOTE 9.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  Fair value measurements are determined under a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, distinguishing between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity ( observable inputs ) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances ( unobservable inputs ).  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the  exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company primarily uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets ( market approach ). The Company also considers the impact of a significant decrease in volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when compared with normal activity to identify transactions that are not orderly. 
    
  The highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Securities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
    
  The three hierarchy levels are defined as follows: 
    
  Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 
    
  Level 2   Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; 
    
  Level 3   Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
    
  The following tables present the Company s liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

The liability for contingent earn-out payments arises from the Company s requirement to pay IntegenX Inc. ( IntegenX ) a percentage of revenues of the product line that the Company acquired from IntegenX in January 2014 (the  Apollo Business ), on a sliding scale up to   20%  , should certain revenue targets be achieved in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The fair value of the acquisition earn-out contingencies is determined using a modeling technique based on significant unobservable inputs calculated using a

probability-weighted revenue approach. At   December 31, 2014  , the fair value was estimated using future annual revenues ranging from   $3.4 million   to   $7.7 million   and a discount rate of   14%  . At   September 30, 2015  , the annual revenue estimates were unchanged from the estimates at December 31, 2014, the liability increasing due to a reduction in the amount of discount, which was expensed as interest. At   December 31, 2015  , the estimate of fair value was updated using future annual revenue ranging from   $3.1 million   to   $5.0 million   and a discount rate of   14%  . At   September 30, 2016  , the annual revenue estimates are unchanged from the estimates at December 31, 2015, the liability increasing due to a reduction in the amount of discount, which was expensed as interest. 
    
  Assumptions used in evaluating the warrant derivative liabilities are discussed in Note 8. The principal assumptions used, and their impact on valuations, are as follows: 
    
  Risk-Free Interest Rate.    This is the U.S. Treasury rate for the measurement date having a term equal to the weighted average expected remaining term of the instrument. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase the fair value and the associated derivative liability. 
    
  Expected Remaining Term.    This is the period of time over which the instrument is expected to remain outstanding and is based on management s estimate, taking into consideration the remaining contractual life, historical experience and the possibility of liquidation. An increase in the expected remaining term will increase the fair value and the associated derivative liability. 
    
  Expected Volatility.    This is a measure of the amount by which the Company s common stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. The Company applies equal weighting to the Company s own historic volatility and the historic volatility of a group of publicly traded companies over the retrospective period corresponding to the expected remaining term of the instrument on the measurement date. The Company applies a reduced weighting to its own historic volatility during the period prior to August 27, 2013, when it was highly leveraged. The group of publicly traded companies is selected from the same industry or market index, with extra weighting attached to those companies most similar in terms of business activity, size and financial leverage. An increase in the expected volatility will increase the fair value and the associated derivative liability. 
    
  Dividend Yield.    The Company has not made any dividend payments and does not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. An increase in the dividend yield will decrease the fair value and the associated derivative liability. 
    
  There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 

NOTE 10.  Net Loss Per Share 
    
  Basic and diluted net loss per share are shown on the statement of operations. No adjustment has been made to the net loss for charges related to MTDC Notes, as the effect would be anti-dilutive due to the net loss. 
    
  The following outstanding stock options, warrants and unit warrants (on an as-converted into common stock basis) and shares issuable or contingently issuable upon conversion of restricted stock, Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock and MTDC Notes were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to holders of common stock as they had antidilutive effects for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

NOTE 11.  Concentrations 
    
  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash in commercial banks. Accounts in the United States are secured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Accounts in Luxembourg are similarly guaranteed. The Company s total deposits at commercial banks usually exceed the balances insured. 
    
  The Company generally requires no collateral from its customers. An allowance for doubtful accounts of   $30,000   was provided as of   September 30, 2016  .   No   such provision was made as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Customers accounting for more than   10%   of total revenues during the three or   nine months ended September 30,     2016   or   2015  , as well as revenues in all corresponding periods, are tabulated as follows: 

NOTE 12.  Contingencies 
    
  From time to time the Company may be involved in claims arising in connection with its business. Based on information currently available, the Company believes that the amount, or range, of reasonably possible losses in connection with any pending actions against it in excess of established reserves, in the aggregate, not to be material to its consolidated financial condition or cash flows. However, losses may be material to the Company s operating results for any particular future period, depending on the level of income or loss for such period.

Company Overview and Background 
    
  Since beginning operations in 2003, we have been engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of genomic technology solutions for single-cell analysis and clinical research. Our ICELL8 Single-Cell System is a cutting edge platform that can isolate thousands of single cells and process specific cells for analysis, including Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ). Our SmartChip platform can be used for profiling and validating molecular biomarkers, and can perform massively parallel singleplex PCR for one step target enrichment and library preparation for clinical NGS. Our Apollo 324 system can be used to process DNA and RNA from clinical samples to NGS-ready libraries. Most recently, our R D efforts have been concentrated on the development and commercialization of our single-cell products. Our products are aimed at researchers who perform genetic analysis and cell biology, primarily at pharmaceutical and biotech companies, academic and private research centers and diagnostics companies involved in biomarker research. We plan to provide new performance standards with significant savings of time and cost for professionals in the field of gene expression research and to facilitate biomarker discovery, toxicology and clinical research through the SmartChip products and services. 
    
  Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high-value products and service projects, the impact of seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending levels in the life science industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns. Any significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay of commercial acceptance of new products, unfavorable sales trends in existing product lines, or impacts from the other factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue. Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income or loss, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indicator of future performance. 
    
  Since inception, we have incurred substantial operating losses. As of   September 30, 2016  , our accumulated deficit was approximately $  119.8 million  . Losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for the research,  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

development and manufacturing start-up costs required to commercialize our initial products. We expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research and development activities for at least the next year as we expand and improve our core technology and its applications in the life science research market. 

Results of Operations 
    
  The following table presents selected items in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

Product Revenue 
    
  The following table presents our product revenue for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

For the   three months ended September 30,     2016  , product revenue   increased   by $  509,000  , or   27%  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30,     2015  . The   increase   is primarily due to an increase in sales of SmartChip systems in the three months ended September 30, 2016, with revenue of $925,000, up 62% from the comparable 2015 period, mainly due to ICELL8 sales. SmartChip capital equipment represented 39% of our product revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to only 30% in the 2015 period. There was also an increase in sales of our SmartChip panels and services, which increased by 14% from the comparable 2015 period in dollar terms and represented 33% of revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 37% in the comparable 2015 period. Revenue from the Apollo Business increased by $57,000 from the comparable 2015 period due to an increase in sales of systems. The Apollo Business accounted for 28% of our product revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 33% in the comparable 2015 period.

     Table of Contents  

For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , product revenue   increased   by $  2,408,000  , or   55%  , as compared to the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  . The   increase   is primarily due to an increase in sales of SmartChip systems in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, with revenue of $2,602,000, up 175% from the comparable 2015 period, mainly due to ICELL8 sales. SmartChip capital equipment represented 38% of our product revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to only 22% in the 2015 period. There was also an increase in sales of our SmartChip panels and services, which increased by 16% from the comparable 2015 period in dollar terms and represented 29% of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 38% in the comparable 2015 period. Revenue from the Apollo Business increased by $482,000 from the comparable 2015 period due to increases in sales of both capital equipment and consumables. The Apollo Business accounted for 33% of our product revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 40% in the comparable 2015 period. 
    
  License and Royalty Revenue 
    
  The following table presents our license and royalty revenue for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

We had no license and royalty revenue in the   three months ended September 30,     2016  ,  as compared to   $125,000   in the   three months ended September 30,     2015  . For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , license and royalty revenue   decreased   by   $333,000  , or   89%  , as compared to the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  . This revenue was generated by an agreement signed at the beginning of February 2013, which generated revenue of $500,000 annually for three years until the agreement was terminated at the end of January 2016. 
    
  Cost of Product Revenue 
    
  The following table presents the cost of our product revenue for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

Cost of product revenue includes the cost of products paid to third party vendors and raw materials, labor and overhead for products manufactured internally, and reserves for warranty and inventory obsolescence. 
    
  For the   three months ended September 30,     2016  , cost of product revenue   increased   by   $276,000  , or   33%  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30,     2015  . The   increase   related primarily to the increase in product revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2016, and also due to a decrease in gross margin, which declined from 55% to 53%, mainly due to an increase from 33% to 48% in the percentage of revenue derived from sales of capital equipment, which affords lower margins. 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , cost of product revenue   increased   by   $1,439,000  , or   74%  , as compared to the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  . The   increase   related primarily to the increase in product revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and also due to a decrease in gross margin, which declined from 56% to 50%, mainly due to an increase from 33% to 52% in the percentage of revenue derived from sales of capital equipment, which affords lower margins. 
    
  Sales and Marketing 
    
  The following table presents our sales and marketing expenses for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively:

     Table of Contents  

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation costs of our sales and marketing team, commissions, and the costs associated with various marketing programs. 
    
  For the   three months ended September 30,     2016  , sales and marketing expenses   increased   by   $312,000  , or   22%  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30,     2015  . This   increase   resulted primarily increases in personnel costs due to an increased headcount in the United States and higher commissions due to increased revenue, partially offset by a decrease in recruitment costs. 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , sales and marketing expenses   increased   by   $1,452,000  , or   37%  , as compared to the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  . This   increase   resulted primarily from increases in personnel costs due to an increased headcount in the United States, higher costs in Europe, mostly due to the conclusion of a matching grant (a governmental subsidy under which 50% of eligible costs were reimbursed, which was fully depleted by March 31, 2015), higher commissions due to increased revenue, and an increase in facilities costs, primarily due to the expense of relocating our headquarters. These increases were partially offset by reductions in recruitment costs, consultancy costs and severance costs. 
    
  We expect our sales and marketing expenses for the remainder of 2016 to remain at a similar level to that of the first nine months. 
    
  Research and Development 
    
  The following table presents our research and development expenses for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. Research and development expenses are expensed as they are incurred. 
    
  For the   three months ended September 30,     2016  , research and development expenses   decreased   by   $168,000  , or   7%  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30,     2015  . For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , research and development expenses   decreased   by   $256,000  , or   4%  , as compared to the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  . The   decrease   in both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the prior year periods, resulted primarily from a reduction in activities related to the development and commercialization of our single-cell products which we launched into the market in October 2015. 
    
  We believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential in the long term to remain competitive and expand into additional markets. Accordingly, we expect our research and development expenses to remain at a high level relative to total expenditures for the foreseeable future. However, if revenues grow as forecast by management, research and development expenses should decrease as a percentage of revenues. 
    
  General and Administrative 
    
  The following table presents our general and administrative expenses for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance, human resources, business development, and general management, as well as professional fees, such as expenses for legal and accounting services. 

18 

     Table of Contents  

For the   three months ended September 30,     2016  , general and administrative expenses   increased   by   $99,000  , or   13%  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30,     2015  . The   increase   resulted primarily from increases in stock compensation expense and legal and professional fees incurred related to the proposed merger contemplated by our Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 12, 2016 (the  Merger Agreement ) with Takara Bio USA Holdings, Inc. ( Takara ) and certain other parties thereto, partially offset by a reduction in investor relations expense. 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , general and administrative expenses   increased   by   $238,000  , or   7%  , as compared to the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  . The   increase   resulted primarily from the substantial legal and professional fees incurred related to our proposed merger, partially offset by decreases in severance expense, stock compensation expense and recruitment costs. 
    
  Interest Expense, Net 
    
  The following table presents interest expense, net for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

For the   three months ended September 30,     2016  , interest expense   increased   by   $4,000  , or   4%  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30,     2015  . For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , interest expense   increased   by   $11,000  , or   3%  , as compared to the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  . The   increase   in both periods was due to the higher cost of debt discount amortization related to the $5.2 million in long-term debt issued to Malaysian Technology Development Corporation Sdn. Bhd. ( MTDC ), an investor in WaferGen Biosystems (M) Sdn. Bhd. ( WGBM ), our now-dissolved Malaysian subsidiary (the  MTDC Notes ), which are being amortized using the effective yield method, which weights the interest charges towards the latter stages of the contractual term of the debt. Interest on the MTDC Notes is expected to be $439,000 in 2016, rising each year up to $732,000 in 2019, the last full year before this debt matures. The increase in each period was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense related to our earn-out contingency.  
    
  Gain on Revaluation of Warrant Derivative Liabilities, Net 
    
  The following table represents the gain on revaluation of warrant derivative liabilities, net for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

Our warrant derivative liabilities arise due to the cash settlement provisions in certain warrants and unit warrants and, until the time of their expiry, the variable number of shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of those warrants with certain anti-dilution protection. 
    
  The net   gain   from revaluation of warrant derivative liabilities for the   three months ended September 30,     2016  , was   $1,000  , compared to a net   gain   of   $68,000   for the   three months ended September 30,     2015  . The net   gain   from revaluation of warrant derivative liabilities for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , was   $4,000  , compared to a net   gain   of   $108,000   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  . Gains and losses are directly attributable to revaluations of our derivative liabilities and result primarily from a net decrease or increase, respectively, in our stock price in the period. Our closing stock price was   $0.85   on   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.82   on   June 30, 2016   and   $0.73   on   December 31, 2015  , and was   $1.36   on   September 30, 2015  , compared to   $3.15   on   June 30, 2015   and   $3.00   on   December 31, 2014  . The related derivative liability as of   September 30, 2016  , had declined to a de minimis value, so we do not expect future gains and losses to be material.

Miscellaneous Income (Expense) 
    
  The following table presents miscellaneous income (expense) for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

For the   three months ended September 30,     2016  , we recorded miscellaneous   income   of   $7,000  , compared to no income or   expense   for the   three months ended September 30,     2015  . For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , we recorded miscellaneous   income   of   $10,000  , compared to   expense   of   $49,000   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  . Miscellaneous income or expense is the result of net foreign currency exchange gains or losses which arise on our subsidiary in Luxembourg and on U.S. expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The principal reason for the income in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is net assets of $0.6 million being denominated in Euros, which increased in value against the U.S. dollar by 3% during the period, whereas in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net assets of $0.4 million denominated in Euros declined in value against the U.S. dollar by 8% during the period. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  The following table presents the provision for income taxes for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

For the   three months ended September 30,     2016  , we reversed a charge of   $5,000   for U.S. state income taxes. We recorded no income tax expense for the   three months ended September 30,     2015  . For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , we recorded a charge of   $8,000   and   $2,000  , respectively, for U.S. state income taxes. We also recorded a charge of   $2,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , for foreign taxes. We have recorded a liability to the extent that our deferred tax liabilities arise from assets with indefinite lives and have provided a full valuation allowance against the remainder our net deferred tax assets. 
    
  Headcount 
    
  Our consolidated headcount as of   November 9, 2016  , comprised 56 regular employees, 55 of whom were employed full-time, compared to 54 regular employees as of   December 31, 2015  , 53 of whom were employed full-time. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our principal source of liquidity was $  5.1 million   in cash and cash equivalents. We had working capital of $  3.9 million  . Our funding has primarily been generated by the issuance of equity securities, which includes $15.7 million and $18.0 million raised, net of offering costs, in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We also had, as of   September 30, 2016  , Notes with a principal amount of $5.2 million owing to MTDC, repayable in August 2020. 
    
  Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 
    
  We experienced negative cash flow from operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , in the amounts of   $9,613,000   and   $10,712,000  , respectively. The cash used in operating activities in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was due to cash used to fund a net loss of   $12,965,000  , adjusted for non-cash expenses related to depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, gain on revaluation of warrant derivative liabilities, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory provision and amortization of debt discount totaling   $2,361,000  , and cash   provided   by a change in working capital of   $991,000  . The cash used in operating activities in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , was due to cash used to fund a net loss of   $12,103,000  , adjusted for non-cash expenses related to depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, gain on

revaluation of warrant derivative liabilities, inventory provision and amortization of debt discount totaling   $1,859,000  , and cash   used   by a change in working capital of   $468,000  . 
    
  Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
    
  We used   $299,000   and   $146,000   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, to acquire property and equipment.  
    
  Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
    
  We used   $135,000   and   $108,000   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, in repayments on capital leases for equipment. We also used   $42,000   and   $94,000   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, to pay income taxes for restricted stock forfeited. 
    
  Availability of Additional Funds 
    
  We believe funds available at   September 30, 2016  , along with our revenue, are sufficient to fund our operations into 2017. To continue our operations thereafter, we may need to raise further capital, through the sale of additional securities or otherwise. Our operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. At the present time, we have no material commitments for capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, most notably our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services. 
    
  We may need additional capital to maintain and expand our operations. Except to the extent available pursuant to our Deposit Agreement   dated May 12, 2016, with Takara  , we have no commitments to obtain any additional funds and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital as we need it on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, our ability to raise additional capital is limited by the terms of the Merger Agreement. The conversion of our MTDC Notes, as well as the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future, may be dilutive to our stockholders, and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that could restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness, and may contain other terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to obtain additional capital as needed we may not be able to continue our efforts to develop and commercialize our products and services and may be forced to significantly curtail or suspend our operations. 

Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements of WaferGen Bio-systems, Inc. include the accounts of Wafergen, Inc. and WaferGen Biosystems Europe S.a.r.l., our Luxembourg subsidiary. All significant inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance 
    
  We believe substantial uncertainties exist regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets and, accordingly, to the extent that it does not relate to a liability related to indefinite-lived assets, a full valuation allowance is required, amounting to approximately $41 million at December 31, 2015. In subsequent periods, if and when we generate pre-tax income, a tax expense will not be recorded to the extent that the remaining valuation allowance can be used to offset that expense. Once a consistent pattern of pre-tax income is established or other events occur that indicate that the deferred tax assets will be realized, additional portions or all of the remaining valuation allowance will be reversed back to income. Should we generate pre-tax losses in subsequent periods, a tax benefit will not be recorded and the valuation allowance will be increased. 
    
  Inventory Valuation 
    
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We perform a detailed assessment of inventory on a regular basis, which includes, among other factors, a review of projected demand requirements, product pricing, product expiration and product lifecycle. As a result of this assessment, we record provisions for potentially excess, obsolete or impaired goods, when appropriate, in order to reduce the reported amount of inventory to its net realizable value. If actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

     Table of Contents  

Warranty Reserve 
    
  Our standard warranty agreement is one year from shipment for SmartChip cyclers, ICELL8s and dispensers and Apollo systems. We accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment of these products. Our warranty reserve is based on management s judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and associated repair costs, and we update our assessment quarterly. 
    
  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  We measure the fair value of all stock option and restricted stock awards to employees on the grant date and record the fair value of these awards, net of estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense over the service period. The fair value of options is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and of restricted stock is based on our closing share price on the measurement date. Amounts expensed with respect to options (including the January 2016 Conditional Award) were $  387,000   and $  659,000  , net of estimated forfeitures, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These sums exclude the compensation expense for restricted stock awards, for which the fair value is based on our closing stock price on the grant date for directors and employees, and on the dates on which performance of services is recognized for consultants. 
    
  The weighted average grant date fair value of the options awarded in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , measured on the date on which potential cash settlement provisions were eliminated, was estimated to be   $0.59   and   $2.56  , respectively, based on the following assumptions:  

The grant date fair values of options are estimated using the following assumptions: 
    
  Risk-Free Interest Rate  .  This is the U.S. Treasury rate for the day of the grant having a term equal to the expected term of the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase the fair value and the related compensation expense. 
    
  Expected Remaining Term  .  This is the period of time over which the award is expected to remain outstanding and is based on management s estimate, taking into consideration the vesting terms, the contractual life and historical experience. An increase in the expected term will increase the fair value and the related compensation expense. 
    
  Expected Volatility  .  This is a measure of the amount by which our common stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. We apply 50% weighting to our own historic volatility and 50% to the historic volatility of a group of publicly traded companies over the retrospective period corresponding to the expected term of the options on the measurement date. We apply a reduced weighting to our own historic volatility during the period prior to August 27, 2013, when we were highly leveraged. The group of publicly traded companies is selected from the same industry or market index, with extra weighting attached to those companies most similar in terms of business activity, size and financial leverage. An increase in the expected volatility will increase the fair value and the related compensation expense. 
    
  Dividend Yield  .  We have not made any dividend payments and do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. An increase in the dividend yield will decrease the fair value and the related compensation expense. 
    
  Forfeiture Rate  .  This is a measure of the amount of awards that are expected to not vest. An increase in the estimated forfeiture rate will decrease the related compensation expense. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, result of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our management performed, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the report we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There was no material change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
    
  From time to time we may be involved in claims arising in connection with our business. Based on information currently available, we believe that the amount, or range, of reasonably possible losses in connection with any pending actions against us in excess of established reserves, in the aggregate, not to be material to our consolidated financial condition or cash flows. However, losses may be material to our operating results for any particular future period, depending on the level of income for such period. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
    
  You should consider the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on   March 25, 2016  , together with all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q when evaluating our business and our prospects. There are no material changes from the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .
