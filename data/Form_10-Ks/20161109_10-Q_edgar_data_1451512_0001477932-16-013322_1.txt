AND SUBSIDIARIES     Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Organization      References in this document to the  Company,   Terra Tech,   we,   us,  or  our  are intended to mean Terra Tech Corp. ( Terra Tech ), individually, or as the context requires, collectively with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.     We were incorporated in Nevada on July 22, 2008, under the name Private Secretary, Inc. Our original business was developing a software program that would allow for automatic call processing through voice-over-Internet protocol, or  VoIP , technology. Our operations were limited to capital formation, organization, and development of its business plan and target customer market. We generated no revenue. We changed our name to Terra Tech Corp. on January 27, 2012.     On February 9, 2012, we completed a reverse-triangular merger with GrowOp Technology Ltd., a Nevada corporation ( GrowOp Technology ), whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of GrowOp Technology and in exchange we issued: (i) 33,998,520 shares of its common stock, (ii) 100 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, convertible into shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis, and (iii) 14,750,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, with each share convertible into 5.384325537 shares of common stock. As a result of the merger, GrowOp Technology became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Following the merger, Terra Tech ceased its prior operations and is now solely a holding company. Through GrowOp Technology, we engage in the design, marketing, and sale of hydroponic equipment with proprietary technology to create sustainable solutions for the cultivation of indoor agriculture.     We are also a wholesale seller of locally grown hydroponic produce, herbs, and florals through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Edible Garden Corporation, a Nevada corporation ( Edible Garden ). We acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares in Edible Garden pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement, dated March 23, 2013 (the  Share Exchange Agreement ), entered into by and among Terra Tech, Edible Garden, and the stockholders of Edible Garden. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we offered and sold 1,250,000 shares of our common stock in consideration for all the issued and outstanding shares in Edible Garden. Separately, Amy Almsteier, one of our stockholders and a director (and, at that time, an executive officer), offered and sold 7,650,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Kenneth Vande Vrede, Michael Vande Vrede, Steven Vande Vrede, Daniel Vande Vrede, Beverly Willekes, and David Vande Vrede (collectively, the  Former EG Principal Stockholders ).     On March 19, 2014, we formed MediFarm, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ( MediFarm ), as a subsidiary. On July 18, 2014, we formed MediFarm I, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ( MediFarm I ), as a subsidiary. On July 30, 2014, we formed MediFarm II, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ( MediFarm II ), as a subsidiary. Through MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II, we are currently operating one medical marijuana dispensary facility in Nevada and plan to operate additional medical marijuana cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in that state. In April 2016, MediFarm commenced operations at its dispensary in Las Vegas, Nevada under the  Bl m  brand.     On September 16, 2014, we formed IVXX, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ( IVXX ), as a wholly-owned subsidiary, for the purpose of producing a line of cannabis flowers and cigarettes, as well as a complete line of cannabis pure concentrates including: oils, waxes, shatters, and clears. We began producing and selling IVXX s products during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We currently offer these products to 200 select dispensaries in California. We use our extraction lab located in Oakland, California to manufacture these products. IVXX also sells clothing, apparel, and other various branded products.               6

MediFarm I RE is a real estate holding company that owns the real property and building at which a medical marijuana dispensary facility will be located. It is our intention that MediFarm I will operate the medical marijuana dispensary. We own 50% of the membership interests in MediFarm I RE. The remaining membership interests are owned by Forever Young Investments, LLC (50%), an otherwise unaffiliated entity.     On April 1, 2016, we acquired Black Oak Gallery, a California corporation ( Black Oak ). Black Oak operates a medical marijuana dispensary in Oakland, California under the name Bl m, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 23, 2015 (the  Merger Agreement ), with Generic Merger Sub, Inc., a California corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (the  Merger Sub ), and Black Oak. The Merger Agreement was amended by a First Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 29, 2016. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Merger Sub merged with and into Black Oak, with Black Oak as the surviving corporation, and became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the  Merger ). The Merger is intended to qualify for Federal income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger, the outstanding shares of common stock of Black Oak held by (i) three of the current shareholders of Black Oak (the  Group A Shareholders ) were converted into the right to receive approximately 8,166 shares of our Series Z preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Series Z Preferred Stock ), of which approximately 1,175 shares of Series Z Preferred Stock were issued and paid at closing, and approximately 8,668,700 shares of our Series B preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Series B Preferred Stock ), of which approximately 1,248,300 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were issued and paid at closing and (ii) the remaining shareholders of Black Oak (the  Group B Shareholders ) were converted into the right to receive approximately 21,378 shares of our Series Q preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Series Q Preferred Stock), of which approximately 3,695 shares of Series Q Preferred Stock were issued and paid at closing. The shares of Series Z Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series Q Preferred Stock that were issued but not paid to the Black Oak shareholders at closing are subject to certain holdback and lock-up provisions, and held in an escrow account as security for the satisfaction of any post-closing adjustments or indemnification claims, as provided for in the Merger Agreement. Each share of Series Q Preferred Stock was converted into 5,000 shares of our common stock and each share of Series Z Preferred Stock was converted into 1,857 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, in each case immediately upon our filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada an Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to increase our authorized capital for, among other reasons, satisfaction of the terms of this potential transaction. Accordingly, the approximately 21,378 shares of Series Q Preferred Stock was issued to the Group B Shareholders was converted into approximately 106,890,000 shares of common stock and the approximately 8,166 shares of Series Z Preferred Stock was issued to the Group A Shareholders was converted into approximately 15,164,262 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Series Z Preferred Stock was intended to mirror the rights of the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock. Each share of our Series B Preferred Stock remains convertible into 5.384325537 shares of our common stock. The aggregate fair market value of the securities issued in the Merger was approximately $22.9 million. The Group B Shareholders may also receive cash consideration equal to approximately $2.1 million.     The securities paid to the Group A Shareholders and the Group B Shareholders are subject to certain post-closing adjustments that are based on certain performance indicators as of the first anniversary of the closing date of the Merger. The first indicator is based on the performance of the volume-weighted average price of our common stock on the first anniversary of the closing date of the Merger compared to the price of our common stock on the date of the Merger Agreement. The second indicator is based on our revenues for the twelve-month period following the closing date of the Merger. A portion of the securities that the Group A Shareholders and the Group B Shareholders are entitled to receive at closing of the Merger will be held in an escrow until the first anniversary of the closing date of the Merger and the post-closing adjustments are complete.               7       
     Table of Contents          TERRA TECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (Continued)      Since the Merger was completed on April 1, 2016, Black Oak s financial results are included in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.      Basis of Presentation      The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of Terra Tech. and subsidiaries. These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.      Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,  of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Cash and Cash Equivalents      Cash and all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase, including money market mutual funds, short-term time deposits, and government agency and corporate obligations, are classified as cash and cash equivalents.      Accounts Receivable      We review all outstanding accounts receivable for collectability on a quarterly basis. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for any amounts deemed uncollectable. We do not accrue interest receivable on past due accounts receivable. There was an allowance for doubtful accounts of $159,169 at September 30, 2016 and $184,642 at December 31, 2015.      Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements      Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets: 3 to 32 years for machinery and equipment, leasehold improvements, and buildings are amortized over the estimated useful life. Repairs and maintenance expenditures that do not extend the useful lives of related assets are expensed as incurred. We test property and equipment for impairment annually for recoverability or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carry amount may not be recoverable. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we have concluded that the sum of the undiscounted cash flows exceeds the carry amount of the assets.               8       
     Table of Contents          TERRA TECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 1       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (Continued)       Intangibles      Intangible assets are stated at historical cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives. We use a straight-line method of amortization, unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined. The approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets are as follows: customer relationships, five to 15 years; trade names, five to 15 years; and dispensary license, 15 years.     We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product recall, or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. For purposes of the recoverability test, we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of the intangible asset (asset group) exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset (asset group), we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified.     We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset (asset group).      The Carrying Value, Recoverability and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets      We have adopted paragraph 360-10-35-17 of FASB Accounting Standards Codification for our long-lived assets. Our long -lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group of assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is generally determined using the assets expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives.     We consider the following to be some examples of important indicators that may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant under-performance or losses of assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant changes in the manner or use of assets or in our overall strategy with respect to the manner of use of the acquired assets or changes in our overall business strategy; (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iv) increased competitive pressures; (v) a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and (vi) regulatory changes. We evaluate acquired assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events. The impairment charges, if any, are included in operating expenses in the accompanying statements of operations. Based on the test results, no impairments have occurred.              9

Revenue Recognition        Cannabis Products       We recognize revenue from product sales net of discounts, rebates, promotional adjustments, price adjustments, and estimated returns and upon transfer of title and risk to the customer, which occurs at shipping (F.O.B. terms). Upon shipment, we have no further performance obligations, selling price is fixed, and collection is reasonably assured.     We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605,   Revenue Recognition ,  by recognizing as revenue the fees we charge customers because persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees we charge are substantially fixed or determinable during the period that we provide the goods or services, we and our customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions, and payment is made for the goods or services when they have been rendered.     Revenue is recognized net of discounts, rebates, promotional adjustments, price adjustments, and returns, and net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Revenue is recorded upon transfer of title and risk to the customer which occurs at the time customers take delivery of our products at our retail dispensary. Upon purchase, we have no further performance obligations and collection is assured as sales are paid for at time of purchase.     Revenue related to the sale of consignment inventory is not recognized until the product is pulled from inventory and sold directly to our end-customers at our retail dispensary. We recognize revenue from the sale of consignment inventory on a gross basis, as it has determined that it is the primary obligor to the customer, has latitude in establishing the sales prices and profit margins of its products, has discretion in selecting its suppliers, is responsible for loss or damage to consigned inventory and through its customer validation process performs an important part of the process of providing such products to authorized customers. We believe that these factors outweigh the fact that we do not have title to the consigned inventory prior to its sale.     During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, sales returns were not significant and, as such, no sales return allowance has been recorded as of September 30, 2016.       Hydroponic Produce       We recognize revenue from products grown in our greenhouses and sold net of discounts, rebates, promotional adjustments, price adjustments, and estimated returns and upon transfer of title and risk to the customer, which occurs at shipping (F.O.B. terms). Upon shipment, we have no further performance obligations, selling price is fixed, and collection is reasonably assured.        TERRA TECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (Continued)      For sales for which we use an outside grower, we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. We determine the product specifications, cultivation, and packaging, while disclosing trade and operational secrets, greenhouse technologies, and nutrients used to grow. We are the primary obligor in the transaction because it is our brand that is sold into the retail channel. We are subject to inventory risk until product is accepted by the retailer. We bear credit risk for the amount billed to the retailer and, thus, must pay the grower in the event the selling price is not collected. This revenue is recorded at the gross sale price once the retailer has accepted delivery, selling price is fixed, and collection is reasonably assured.      Cost of Goods Sold         Cannabis Products       Cost of goods sold includes the costs directly attributable to product sales and includes amounts paid for finished goods, such as flower, edibles, and concentrates, as well as, packaging and other supplies, fees for services and processing, other expenses for services, and allocated overhead. Overhead expenses include allocations of rent, administrative salaries, utilities, and related costs. It also includes the cost incurred in producing the oils, waxes, shatters, and clears sold by IVXX.       Hydroponic Produce       Cost of goods sold are for the plants grown and purchased and sold into the retail marketplace by Edible Garden.      Loyalty Rewards Program      We offer a customer loyalty rewards program that allows members to earn discounts on future purchases. The amount of unused discounts earned by our loyalty rewards program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time a qualifying purchase is made. Revenue is recognized when points are redeemed by the loyalty rewards program member. We began offering customers the loyalty rewards program during April 2015 and the value of points accrued as of September 30, 2016 was $25,097.      Research and Development      Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.      Income Taxes      We provide for income taxes based on enacted tax law and statutory tax rates at which items of income and expenses are expected to be settled in our income tax return. Certain items of revenue and expense are reported for Federal income tax purposes in different periods than for financial reporting purposes, thereby resulting in deferred income taxes. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company has incurred net operating losses for financial-reporting and tax-reporting purposes. Accordingly, for Federal and state income tax purposes, the benefit for income taxes has been offset entirely by a valuation allowance against the related Federal and state deferred tax asset for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.          TERRA TECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (Continued)       Loss Per Common Share      Net loss per share is computed in accordance with the provisions of ASC 260,   Earnings Per Share,   by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. During a loss period, the effect of the potential exercise of stock options, warrants, convertible preferred stock, and convertible debt are not considered in the diluted income (loss) per share calculation since the effect would be anti-dilutive. The results of operations were a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016; therefore, the basic and diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding were the same.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments      We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:      Level 1  - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.      Level 2 -  Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.      Level 3 -  Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.     Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.     In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We have not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.        TERRA TECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (Continued)       Recently Issued Accounting Standards        Leases       In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 requires entities to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases, including operating leases, with terms of more than 12 months. The new standard also requires additional disclosures on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information. The new standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes       In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17 ). ASU 2015-17 requires entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The new standard is effective for public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption allowed on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company adopted ASU 2015-17, on a prospective basis, for its annual period ending December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016 reflects the presentation of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in accordance with ASU 2015-17.       Inventory Measurement       In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ( ASU 2015-11 ), which requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value ( NRV ). A SU 2015-11 defines NRV as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The ASU will not apply to inventories that are measured by using either the last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method. The guidance in ASU 2015-11 is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. Upon transition, entities must disclose the nature of and reason for the accounting change. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.       Going Concern Disclosures       In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15: Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.          TERRA TECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN      Our future success is dependent upon our ability to achieve profitable operations and generate cash from operating activities, and upon additional financing. Management believes they can raise the appropriate funds needed to support their business plan and develop an operating company that is cash-flow positive.     However, we incurred net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and have an accumulated deficit of $60,600,170 at September 30, 2016. We have not been able to generate sufficient cash from operating activities to fund its ongoing operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate enough revenue and/or raise capital to support our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.     The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability or classification of recorded assets and liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.      NOTE 3   CONCENTRATIONS OF BUSINESS AND CREDIT RISK      We maintain cash balances in several financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to certain federal limitations.     We provide credit in the normal course of business to customers located throughout the U.S. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information.      NOTE   4   ACQUISITIONS      In March 2016, we acquired certain assets from Therapeutics Medical. The fair value of total consideration transferred in connection with the acquisition was $1,250,000. Of the total purchase price, $58,622 was attributed to finished goods inventory, $191,378 was attributed to the existing brands, and $1,000,000 was attributed to the trademarks, patent, customer list, and vendor numbers. We have determined that the trademarks, patent, customer list, and vendor numbers have a useful life of 5 years.     On April 1, 2016, we acquired all of the assets of Black Oak. The acquisition of Black Oak was accounted for in accordance with ASC 805-10 Business Combinations. The assets consisted primarily of the intellectual property and established marketing associated with the brand name  Bl m,  including its website, www.blumoak.com, the medical marijuana dispensary license, and customer relationships.        TERRA TECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 4   ACQUISITIONS   (Continued)      The following table summarizes the acquisition with a purchase price of $51,489,665:         The estimated purchase price of Black Oak (for accounting purposes) was $51,489,665. The purchase price was determined based on the value of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the various series of preferred stock issued in connection with the acquisition, or $0.2620 per share of common stock, which was the closing sales price of our common stock on April 1, 2016, as quoted on the OTC Market Group Inc. s OTCQX tier.     The purchase price represents the sum of:     (i) the issuance of approximately 1,176 shares of our Series Z Preferred Stock (or, upon conversion, 11,759,242 shares of our common stock), approximately 1,248,300 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (or, upon conversion, 6,721,254 shares of our common stock), and approximately 3,696 shares of our Series Q Preferred Stock (or, upon conversion, 18,480,493 shares of our common stock), which collectively, were converted into 36,960,989 shares of our common stock (the  Closing Consideration ); and     (ii) the issuance of approximately 4,210 shares of our Series Z Preferred Stock (or, upon conversion, 42,098,295 shares of our common stock), approximately 4,468,872 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (or, upon conversion, 24,061,862 shares of our common stock), and approximately 8,945 shares of our Series Q Preferred Stock (or, upon conversion, 44,722,796 shares of our common stock), which collectively, were converted into approximately 110,882,953 shares of our common stock (the  Lockup Consideration ); and     (iii) the issuance of approximately 2,781 shares of our Series Z Preferred Stock (or, upon conversion, 27,804,112 shares of our common stock), approximately 2,951,528 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (or, upon conversion, 15,891,988 shares of our common stock), and approximately 8,739 shares of our Series Q Preferred Stock (or, upon conversion, 43,696,102 shares of our common stock), which collectively, were converted into approximately 87,392,202 shares of our common stock (the  Holdback Consideration ); and     (iv) the contingent cash consideration of up to $2,088,000 pursuant to certain earn-out provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement, payable to the Group B Shareholders (the  Performance-based Cash Consideration ).

Lockup Consideration       Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Lockup Consideration was issued on April 1, 2016, the closing date; however, such shares will be held in an escrow account for a period of one year.       Holdback Consideration       Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Holdback Consideration was issued on April 1, 2016, the closing date; however, such shares will be held in an escrow account for a period of one year as security for the satisfaction of any post-closing adjustments or indemnification claims as provided for in the Merger Agreement.       Performance-Based Cash Consideration       Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Performance-Based Cash Consideration is to be paid in cash on approximately the one-year anniversary date of the Merger Agreement and is subject to certain holdback provisions. Accordingly, the Performance-Based Cash Consideration is unpaid and recorded as contingent consideration as security for the satisfaction of any post-closing adjustments or indemnification claims as provided for in the Merger Agreement.     The below chart outlines a summary of the purchase price:         The Series Q Preferred Stock was converted into 106,890,000 shares of common stock in September 2016. The Series Z Preferred Stock was converted into 15,164,262 Series B Preferred Stock in September 2016.          TERRA TECH CORP.

Work-In-Progress consists of live plants grown for Edible Garden s herb, produce, and floral product lines along with IVXX s line of cannabis pure concentrates. Finished goods consists of Blum s, MediFarm s and IVXX s line of cannabis packaged to be sold to the patients and into dispensaries. Cost of goods sold is calculated using the average costing method. The Company reviews its inventory periodically to determine net realizable value. The Company writes down inventory, if required, based on forecasted demand. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, new products introductions, and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Inventory at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:          NOTE 6     PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS      Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements, at cost, less accumulated depreciation, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:         Depreciation expense related to property, equipment and leasehold improvements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $827,391 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $602,814.

AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 7     INTANGIBLE ASSETS      Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We recorded amortization expense of $826,400 and $42,480 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. Based solely on the amortizable intangible assets recorded at September 30, 2016, we estimate amortization expense to be $1,239,290 in 2016, $1,651,560 in 2017, $1,622,532 in 2018, $1,609,080 in 2019, $1,609,080 in 2020 and an aggregate of $13,719,270 in years after 2020. Actual amortization expense to be reported in future periods could differ from these estimates as a result of new intangible asset acquisitions, changes in useful lives or other relevant factors or changes.

AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 9   NOTES PAYABLE   (Continued)      Total debt as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was $2,789,642 and $917,363, respectively, which included unamortized debt discount of $4,474,664 and $693,435, respectively. The senior secured promissory notes are secured by shares of common stock. There was accrued interest of $91,527 as of September 30, 2016.      NOTE 10   CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY      The Company accounts for  contingent consideration  according to FASB ASC 805  Business Combinations  ( FASB ASC 805 ). Contingent consideration typically represents the acquirer s obligation to transfer additional assets or equity interests to the former owners of the acquiree if specified future events occur or conditions are met. FASB ASC 805 requires that contingent consideration be recognized at the acquisition-date fair value as part of the consideration transferred in the transaction. FASB ASC 805 uses the fair value definition in  Fair Value Measurements , which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As defined in FASB ASC 805, contingent consideration is (i) an obligation of the acquirer to transfer additional assets or equity interests to the former owners of an acquiree as part of the exchange for control of the acquire, if specified future events occur or conditions are met or (ii) the right of the acquirer to the return of previously transferred consideration, if specified conditions are met.          TERRA TECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 10   CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY   (Continued)      Accordingly, the Company valued the Holdback Consideration and the Performance-based Cash Consideration (collectively, the  Contingent Consideration ), based on an analysis using a cash flow model to determine the expected contingent consideration payment, which model determined that the aggregate expected contingent consideration liability was $15,305,463 and the present value of the contingent consideration liability was $12,754,553. Accordingly, the Company recognized at April 1, 2016, the closing date of the Black Oak merger, a $12,754,553 contingent consideration liability associated with the Contingent Consideration paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement.     In determining the likelihood of payouts related to the Contingent Consideration, the probabilities for various scenarios ( e . g ., a 75% probability that the maximum amount of Contingent Consideration will be payable), as well as the discount rate used in the Company s calculations were based on internal projections, all of which were vetted by the Company s senior management.       Holdback Consideration       The Holdback Consideration is comprised of (i) the market-based clawback amount (the  Market-Based Clawback Amount ) and (ii) the performance-based clawback amount (the  Performance-Based Clawback Amount ). The Holdback Consideration, which is comprised of shares of our preferred stock, was issued on April 1, 2016, the closing date of the Black Oak merger, and will be held in an escrow account for a period of one year.     The Market-Based Clawback Amount is determined as follows:              a)     If the Terra Tech Common Stock 30-day VWAP on the one-year anniversary date of the Merger Agreement exceeds the Terra Tech Closing Price, the Market-Based Clawback Amount shall mean the number of shares of Terra Tech Common Stock equal to (i) (A) $4,912,000.00 divided by (B) the Terra Tech Closing Price, less (ii) (A) $4,912,000.00 divided by (B) the Terra Tech Common Stock 30-day VWAP on such date.                b)     If the Terra Tech Common Stock 30-day VWAP on the one-year anniversary date of the Merger Agreement is less than or equal to the Terra Tech Closing Price, the Market-Based Clawback Amount shall be zero shares.        In no event will the Market-Based Clawback Amount exceed 50% of the Holdback Consideration.          TERRA TECH CORP.

TERRA TECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 12   INCOME TAXES   (Continued)      As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $26,700,000 and $18,600,000, respectively, which, if unused, will expire beginning in years 2034. These tax attributes are subject to an annual limitation from equity shifts, which constitute a change of ownership as defined under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, which will limit their utilization. The Company has yet to assess the effect of these limitations, but expects these losses to be substantially limited. Accordingly, the Company has placed a reserve against any assets associated with these losses.     Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative losses incurred through the period ended September 30, 2016. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, as of September 30, 2016, a valuation allowance of has been recorded against all deferred tax assets as these assets are more likely than not to be unrealized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.     For the three quarters ended September 30, 2016, IVXX produced and sold cannabis pure concentrates, both Black Oak and MediFarm operated medical marijuana dispensaries, subjecting the Company to the limits of Internal Revenue Code Section 280E. Pursuant to IRC Section 280E, the Company is allowed only to deduct expenses directly related to sales of product. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the income tax expense is the tax on the gross sales in excess of direct costs that subject the Company to federal income tax pursuant to IRC Section 280E. The Company recorded a deferred tax liability related to the tax depreciation related to its cannabis operations in excess of that reported for financial reporting purposes.

AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 15   COMMITMENTS      The Company entered into an agreement with Platinum Standard, LLC ( Platinum ) to be the operator of Black Oak Gallery. Beginning on April 1, 2016 the Company will pay Platinum $500,000 for the first fiscal year, $550,000 for the second fiscal year and $600,000 for the third fiscal year.      The Company leases certain business facilities under operating lease agreements that specify minimum rentals. Many of these have renewal provisions along with the option to acquire the property. The Company s net rent expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $431,959 and $379,166, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases having an initial or remaining term of more than one year are as follows:          NOTE 16   LITIGATION AND CLAIMS      The Company is the subject of lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business from time to time. The Company reviews any such legal proceedings and claims on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. The Company establishes accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and it discloses the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for the Company s financial statements to not be misleading. To estimate whether a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss. The Company does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present information, the Company determined that there were no matters that required an accrual as of September 30, 2016, nor were there any asserted or unasserted claims for which material losses are reasonably possible.      NOTE 17   SEGMENT INFORMATION      The Company s operating and reportable segments are currently organized around the following products that it offers as part of its core business strategy:                     Hydroponic Produce               Cannabis Products             TERRA TECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 17   SEGMENT INFORMATION   (Continued)      These two reportable segments, which are described in greater detail below, had previously been reported on a combined basis as they had been operated and evaluated as one operating segment. The Company experienced significant growth over the last year in most of our product areas. As the Company has grown organically, and as the Company previously added to its capabilities through acquisitions, its products have increased in scale and become more strategically important and distinctly organized and managed under these two groupings. In addition, Derek Peterson, the Company s chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) has begun reviewing results and managing and allocating resources between these two strategic business groupings, and has begun budgeting using these business segments. The Company s segment information for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 has been reclassified to conform to its current presentation.      The Company s CODM reviews revenues including intersegment revenues, gross profit and operating income (loss) before income taxes when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources to each segment. Accordingly, intersegment revenue is included in the segment revenues presented in the tables below and is eliminated from revenues and cost of sales in the  Eliminations and Other  column. The  Eliminations and Other  column also includes various income and expense items that the Company does not allocate to its operating segments. These income and expense amounts include the results of the Company s hydroponic equipment, which are not material, interest income, interest expense, corporate overhead, and corporate-wide expense items such as legal and professional fees as well as expense items for which we have not identified a reasonable basis for allocation. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.        Hydroponic Produce       The Company s locally grown hydroponic produce, which include produce, herbs, and floral products, are started from seed and are grown in environmentally controlled greenhouses. When harvested, the products are sold through retailers targeted to customers seeking produce, herbs, or floral products locally grown using environmentally sustainable methods.       Cannabis Products       The Company currently operates or plans to operate medical marijuana cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in California and Nevada through its subsidiaries, Black Oak Gallery, MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II. The Company was granted eight provisional permits in Nevada and have received approval from the local authorities with respect to all of the permits. IVXX s cannabis products are currently produced in the Company s lab in California and are sold in select dispensaries throughout California.          TERRA TECH CORP.

COMPANY OVERVIEW       We were incorporated in Nevada on July 22, 2008 under the name Private Secretary, Inc. We changed our name to Terra Tech Corp. on January 27, 2012. Our corporate headquarters is located at 4700 Von Karman Avenue, Suite 110, Newport Beach, California 92660 and our telephone number is (855) 447-6967. Our website addresses are as follows: www.terratechcorp.com, www.growopltd.com, www.ediblegarden.com, www.egrow.com, www.goodearthhydro.com, www.bestbuyhydro.com, and www.ivxx.com.     Our original business was to develop a software program that would allow for automatic call processing through  VoIP  technology. Our operations were limited to capital formation, organization, and development of our business plan and target customer market. We generated no revenue.          On February 9, 2012, we completed a reverse-triangular merger with GrowOp Technology Ltd., a Nevada corporation ( GrowOp Technology ), whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of GrowOp Technology and in exchange we issued: (i) 33,998,520 shares of our common stock, (ii) 100 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, convertible into shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis, and (iii) 14,750,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, with each share convertible into 5.38425537 shares of common stock. The issuance represented approximately 50.3% of our total shares of common stock outstanding, assuming the conversion of all the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, immediately following the closing of the merger. As a result of the merger, GrowOp Technology became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Following the merger, we ceased our prior operations and are now solely a holding company with two wholly-owned subsidiaries. We also own interests in three other subsidiaries. Through GrowOp Technology, we engage in the design, marketing, and sale of hydroponic equipment with propriety technology to create sustainable solutions for the cultivation of indoor agriculture.     We entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, dated March 23, 2013 (the  Share Exchange Agreement ), by and among the Company, Edible Garden Corp., a Nevada corporation ( Edible Garden ), and the stockholders of Edible Garden. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we offered and sold 1,250,000 shares of common stock of the Company in consideration for all the issued and outstanding shares in Edible Garden. Separately, Amy Almsteier, one of our stockholders and a director (and, at that time, an officer) of ours, offered and sold 7,650,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Ken Vande Vrede, Mike Vande Vrede, Steve Vande Vrede, Dan Vande Vrede, Beverly Willekes, and David Vande Vrede (the  Former EG Principal Stockholders ). The 7,650,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock are convertible at any time into 36,344,198 shares of common stock and have voting power equal to 765,000,000 shares of common stock.     The effect of the issuance of the 1,250,000 shares of common stock of the company and the sale of the 7,650,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock by Ms. Almsteier was that as of the date of the issuance and sale, the Former EG Principal Stockholders held approximately 25.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company and approximately 43.3% of the voting power of the Company. Articles of Exchange, consummating the share exchange, were filed with the Secretary of the State of Nevada on April 24, 2013. Through Edible Garden, we are the retail seller of locally grown hydroponic produce.     We formed MediFarm, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ( MediFarm ) on March 19, 2014. We own 60% of the membership interests in MediFarm. The remaining membership interests are owned by Camden Goorjian (20%) and by Richard Vonfeldt (20%), two otherwise unaffiliated individuals. Upon receipt of the necessary governmental approvals and permitting, as to which there can be no assurance, we expect MediFarm to operate medical marijuana cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in Clark County, Nevada and a medical marijuana dispensary facility in the City of Las Vegas.     We formed MediFarm I, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ( MediFarm I ) on July 18, 2014. We own 50% of the membership interests in MediFarm I. The remaining membership interests are owned by Forever Green NV, LLC (50%), an otherwise unaffiliated entity. Upon receipt of the necessary governmental approvals and permitting, as to which there can be no assurance, we expect MediFarm I to operate a medical marijuana dispensary in Reno, Nevada.     We formed MediFarm II, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ( MediFarm II ) on July 30, 2014. We own 55% of the membership interests in MediFarm II. The remaining membership interests are owned by Nevada MF, LLC (30%) and by Forever Green NV, LLC (15%), two otherwise unaffiliated parties. Upon receipt of the necessary governmental approval and permitting, as to which there can be no assurance, we expect MediFarm II to operate a medical marijuana cultivation and production facility in Spanish Springs, Nevada.     We formed IVXX, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ( IVXX ) on September 16, 2014 for the purpose of producing a line of cannabis flowers and cigarettes, as well as a complete line of cannabis pure concentrates, including: oils, waxes, shatters, and clears. We currently offer these products to 200 select dispensaries in California. IVXX also sells clothing, apparel, and other various branded products.          We formed MediFarm I Real Estate, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ( MediFarm I RE ) on October 14, 2015. We own 50% of the membership interests in MediFarm I RE. The remaining membership interests is owned by Forever Young Investments, LLC (50%), an otherwise unaffiliated entity. MediFarm I RE is a real estate holding company that owns the real property and building at which a medical marijuana dispensary facility will be located. It is our intention that MediFarm I will operate the medical marijuana dispensary.     Our business segments consist of hydroponic produce and cannabis products. Our hydroponic produce is locally grown hydroponic produce that is started from seed and is grown in environmentally controlled greenhouses. When harvested, the products are sold through retailers targeted to customers seeking fresh produce locally grown using environmentally sustainable methods. This segment consists of Edible Garden s business and operations. Our cannabis products segment consists of IVXX s business, as well as the proposed business operations of MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II. IVXX s cannabis products are currently produced in our lab in California and are sold in select dispensaries throughout California. We plan to operate medical marijuana cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in Nevada through our subsidiaries, MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II. We were granted eight provisional permits in Nevada and have received approval from the local authorities with respect to eight of the eight permits. See Note 16,  Segment Information , in the Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for information on our net sales, cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, other income (expense), loss from operations, and identifiable assets by segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. We believe that our ramped up marketing and branding efforts position us to stay on track for annual revenues this year of approximately $20 million.       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015        Revenues       For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we generated revenues of approximately $6.9 million, compared to approximately $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $4.9 or 358 percent. The increase was primarily due to revenue generated by Edible Garden for the sales of its herbs and floral products and Black Oak Gallery and IVXX from the sale of its cannabis products. At this stage in our development, revenues are not yet sufficient to cover ongoing operating expenses.       Gross Margin       Our gross profits for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $1.3 million, compared to gross profits of approximately $370,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $950,000. Our gross margin percentage for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately 19 percent, compared to approximately 18 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2015.             Selling, General and Administrative Expenses       Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $6.0 million, compared to approximately $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $3.9 million or 286 percent. The increase was primarily due to: (i) an approximately $401,000 increase in amortization expense due to intangible assets acquired in the Black Oak Gallery acquisition (ii) an approximately $304,000 increase in depreciation for additional farm equipment used by Edible Garden, depreciation incurred at Black Oak Gallery and the assets placed in service at the MediFarm dispensaries; (iii) an approximately $2,262,000 increase in salaries and wages for the staff hired at the Black Oak Gallery and MediFarm dispensaries; (iv) an approximately $430,000 increase in consulting in connection with MediFarm s, MediFarm I s, and MediFarm II s proposed cannabis business in Nevada; (v) an approximately $141,000 increase in security incurred at the Black Oak Gallery and MediFarm dispensaries; (vi) an approximately $98,000 increase in utilities incurred at the Black Oak Gallery and MediFarm dispensaries; (vii) an approximately $98,000 increase in license fees in connection with the MediFarm dispensaries; (viii) an approximately $82,000 in accounting cost incurred to build the infrastructure of the accounting systems; and (ix) an approximately $76,000 in computer systems incurred to build the infrastructure of the MediFarm dispensaries These increases were offset by a reduction in legal fees of approximately $292,000 primarily related to the preparation and filing of registration statements and reviewing of contracts performed in the prior year.       Operating Income (Loss)       We realized an operating loss of approximately $4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an operating loss of approximately $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $3.0 million or 271 percent.       Other Income (Expense)       Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $866,000, compared to income of approximately $258,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $607,000 or 335 percent. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had an increase in amortization of debt discount of approximately $352,000 compared to $258,000 in the prior year s period. We had a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $0 compared to $264,000 in the prior s year s period. We had a loss on issuance of derivatives in the amount of $867,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0 in the prior year s period. The increase of approximately $867,000 was due to convertible notes being issued during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We had a gain on fair market valuation of derivatives in the amount of $771,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a gain of approximately $372,000 in the prior year s period. Interest expense totaled approximately $160,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $109,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was due to more debt outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2016.       Net Loss       We incurred a net loss of approximately $5.6 million, or $0.01 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of approximately $2.0 million, or $0.01 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The primary reasons for the increase in net loss were an increase in revenue, a decrease in cost of goods sold (as a percentage of revenue), a significant increase in sales, general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year s third quarter.     Management will continue its efforts to lower operating expenses and increase revenue. We will continue to invest in further expanding our operations and a comprehensive marketing campaign with the goal of accelerating the education of potential clients and promoting our name and our products. Given the fact that most of the operating expenses are fixed or have a quasi-fixed character, management expects that, as revenue increases, those expenses, as a percentage of revenue, will significantly decrease. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our revenues in succeeding quarters.           Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015        Revenues       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated revenues of approximately $18.2 million, compared to approximately $7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $10.4 million or 233 percent. This increase was primarily due to revenue generated by Edible Garden for the sales of its herbs and floral products and Black Oak Gallery and IVXX from the sale of its cannabis products. At this stage in the Company s development, revenues are not yet sufficient to cover ongoing operating expenses.       Gross Margin       Our gross profits for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $3.1 million, compared to gross profits of approximately $861,100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $2.2 million or 360 percent. Our gross margin percentage for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately 17 percent, compared to approximately 11.0 percent gross margin percentage for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to better margins from Edible Garden as a result of the completed greenhouse facility with high-tech Dutch bucket hydroponic equipment and the sales generated from Black Oak Gallery and IVXX from the sale of its cannabis products.       Selling, General and Administrative Expenses       Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $13.5 million, compared to approximately $7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $5.7 million or 174 percent. The increase was primarily due to: (i) an approximately $795,000 increase in amortization expense due to intangible assets acquired in the Black Oak Gallery acquisition (ii) an approximately $378,000 increase in depreciation for additional farm equipment used by Edible Garden, depreciation incurred at Black Oak Gallery and the assets placed in service at the MediFarm dispensaries; (iii) an approximately $3,194,000 increase in salaries and wages for the staff hired at the Black Oak Gallery and MediFarm dispensaries; (iv) an approximately $2,0540,000 increase in consulting in connection with MediFarm s, MediFarm I s, and MediFarm II s proposed cannabis business in Nevada; (v) an approximately $342,000 increase in security incurred at the Black Oak Gallery and MediFarm dispensaries; (vi) an approximately $164,000 increase in utilities incurred at the Black Oak Gallery and MediFarm dispensaries; (vii) an approximately $123,000 increase in license fees in connection with the MediFarm dispensaries; (viii) an approximately $347,000 in accounting cost incurred to build the infrastructure of the accounting systems; and (ix) an approximately $104,000 in computer systems incurred to build the infrastructure of the MediFarm dispensaries These increases were offset by a reduction in legal fees of approximately $816,000 primarily related to the preparation and filing of registration statements and reviewing of contracts performed in the prior year. Lastly, warrant expense decreased over the prior year s period by approximately $1.15 million primarily due to no warrants issued in the current period.       Operating Income (Loss)       We realized an operating loss of approximately $10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an operating loss of approximately $6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.            Other Income (Expense)       Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $4.1 million, compared to income of approximately $3,700 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had an increase in amortization of debt discount of approximately $398,000 compared to $524,000 in the prior year period. We had a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately $921,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $264,000 in the prior year period. We had a loss on issuance of derivatives of $1,355,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $561,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $794,000 million or 242 percent, due to more convertible notes being issued during the first nine months of fiscal 2016. We had a loss on fair market valuation of derivatives of approximately $596,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a gain of approximately $1.8 million in the prior year period. Interest expense totaled approximately $276,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $427,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is due to less debt outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.       Net Loss       We incurred a net loss of approximately $14.6 million, or $0.04 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of approximately $6.8 million, or $0.03 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The primary reasons for the increase in net loss were an increase in revenue, a decrease in cost of goods sold (as a percentage of revenue), a significant increase in sales, general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015.     Management will continue to make an effort to lower operating expenses and increase revenue. We will continue to invest in further expanding our operations and a comprehensive marketing campaign with the goal of accelerating the education of potential clients and promoting our name and our products. Given the fact that most of the operating expenses are fixed or have a quasi-fixed character management expects that, as revenue increases, those expenses, as a percentage of revenue, will significantly decrease. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our revenues in succeeding periods.       DISCLOSURE ABOUT OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS       We do not have any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that constitute off-balance sheet arrangements.       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING   POLICIES       Our   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   section discusses our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. These accounting policies are described in   Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this report.              LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       We have never reported net income. We incurred net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and have an accumulated deficit of $60.6 million as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $9.8 million. At September 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $3.4 million, compared to a cash balance of $418,000 at December 31, 2015.     We have not been able to generate sufficient cash from operating activities to fund our ongoing operations. Since our inception, we have raised capital through private sales of preferred stock, common stock, and debt securities. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to achieve profitable operations and generate cash from operating activities. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate enough revenue and/or raise capital to support our operations.     We anticipate requiring additional capital for the commercial development of our subsidiaries. We anticipate we will need an additional $10.0 million in capital for the commercial development of MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II. In April 2016, MediFarm commenced operations at its dispensary located in Las Vegas, Nevada under the Bl m brand. None of MediFarm, MediFarm I, or MediFarm II has commenced operations at any other of its proposed cultivation, production, or dispensary facilities.     With respect to the proposed cultivation and production facilities, we intend to complete the construction of such facilities in phases, the timing of which will be dictated by market demand. Accordingly, the $13.5 million budget as described herein is entirely prospective as to the timing and amount of expenditures.     With respect to MediFarm, the estimated construction budget (for year one) and operation budget (for the first five years of operation) is $750,000 for the dispensary facilities and $6.0 million for the cultivation and production facility.     With respect to MediFarm I s dispensary facility, the estimated construction budget (for year one) and operation budget (for the first five years of operation) is $750,000.     With respect to MediFarm II s cultivation and production facility, the estimated construction budget (for year one) and operation budget (for the first five years of operation) is $6.0 million.     Forever Green NV, LLC, a member of both MediFarm I and MediFarm II, has agreed to contribute $500,000 in the form of debt to MediFarm I and $750,000 in the form of debt to MediFarm II. We will be obligated to contribute the remaining amount, or $9.3 million in the aggregate, for all three subsidiaries. This amount is in addition to any proceeds we may receive if and when we sell additional securities.     We will be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing, additional collaborative relationships or other arrangements until we are able to raise revenues to a point of positive cash flow. We believe our existing and available capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our funding requirements through the fourth quarter of 2017. We are evaluating various options to further reduce our cash requirements to operate at a reduced rate, as well as options to raise additional funds, including obtaining loans and selling common stock. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate enough revenue and/or raise capital to support our operations, or if we are able to raise capital, that it will be available to us on acceptable terms, on an acceptable schedule, or at all.     The issuance of additional securities may result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining loans, assuming these loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations or that additional financing will be available for use when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.          Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses, we included a note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation and expansion of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing, successful and sufficient market acceptance of our products, and achieving a profitable level of operations. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability or classification of recorded assets and liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.      Operating Activities      Cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.6 million, compared to $3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1.2 million, or 133.7 percent. Increases in cash used in operations were primarily due to: (i) a $7.9 million increase in net loss; (ii) a decrease of $1.1 million for warrants issued with common stock and debt in the prior period compared to none in the current period; and (iii) a $1.4 million increase in inventory. Decreases in cash used in operations were primarily due to: (i) a $596,000 loss on fair market valuation of derivatives for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a $1.8 million gain on fair market valuation of derivatives for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $2.4 million, or 33.5 percent; and (iii) $1.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $481,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1.2 million.      Investing Activities      Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3.1 million, compared to cash used by investing activities of $590,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the first nine months of 2016, cash used in investing activities was primarily comprised of expenditures related to the construction of the MediFarm dispensaries in Nevada.      Financing Activities      Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $10.7 million, compared to $4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $6.1 million or 236 percent. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to $4.9 million from the issuance of debt, $3.2 million from the sale of common stock and $3.2 million for the exercise of warrants into common stock.       ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET   RISK       As a smaller reporting company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item 3.       ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.       Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer are responsible for conducting an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures means that the material information required to be included in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our company, including any consolidating subsidiaries, and was made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2015.      There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.              PART II. OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.       We are not currently subject to any legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become subject to litigation or proceedings in connection with our business, as either a plaintiff or defendant. There are no such pending legal proceedings to which we are a party that, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.       ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.       There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Please refer to that section for disclosures regarding the risk and uncertainties relating to our business.       ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.
