CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q ( Report ) contains  forward looking statements  within the meaning of applicable
securities laws. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to management s beliefs, plans,
strategies, objectives, goals and expectations, including expectations about the future financial or operating performance of
our Company and its projects, capital expenditures, capital needs, government regulation of the industry, environmental risks,
limitations of insurance coverage, and the timing and possible outcome of regulatory matters, including the granting of patents
and permits. Words such as  expect ,  anticipate ,  intend ,  attempt ,  may ,
 will ,  plan ,  believe ,  seek ,  estimate , and variations of such
words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of
future performance and involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.  

These
statements are based on and were developed using a number of factors and assumptions including, but not limited to: stability
in the U.S. and other foreign economies; stability in the availability and pricing of raw materials, energy and supplies; stability
in the competitive environment; the continued ability of our Company to access cost effective capital when needed; and no unexpected
or unforeseen events occurring that would materially alter the Company s current plans. All of these assumptions have been
derived from information currently available to the Company including information obtained by our Company from third party sources.
Although management believes that these assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions may prove to be incorrect in whole or in
part. As a result of these and other factors, actual results may differ materially from those expressed, implied or forecasted
in such forward looking information, which reflect our Company s expectations only as of the date hereof.  

Factors
that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from the results expressed, implied or forecasted by the forward-looking
statements include risks associated with general business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties; risks associated
with changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; risks associated with failure of plant, equipment or processes
to operate as anticipated; risks associated with accidents or labor disputes; risks associated in delays in obtaining governmental
approvals or financing, or in the completion of development or construction activities; risks associated with financial leverage
and the availability of capital; risks associated with the price of commodities and the inability of our Company to control commodity
prices; risks associated with the regulatory environment within which our Company operates; risks associated with litigation including
the availability of insurance; and risks posed by competition. These and other factors that could cause actual results or outcomes
to differ materially from the results expressed, implied or forecasted by the forward looking statements are discussed in more
detail in the section entitled  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A of this Report and in  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in Part II, Item 2 of this Report.  

Some
of the forward-looking statements may be considered to be financial outlooks for purposes of applicable securities legislation
including, but not limited to, statements concerning capital expenditures. These financial outlooks are presented to allow the
Company to benchmark the results of our Company s Plastic2Oil business. These financial outlooks may not be appropriate
for other purposes and readers should not assume they will be achieved.  

Our
Company does not intend to, and the Company disclaims any obligation to, update any forward-looking statements (including any
financial outlooks), whether written or oral, or whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as
required by law.  

Unless
otherwise noted, references in this Report to  P2O  the  Company,   we,   our 
or  us  means Plastic2Oil, Inc., a Nevada corporation.

NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND GOING CONCERN   

Plastic2Oil,
Inc. (the  Company  or  P2O ) was originally incorporated as 310 Holdings, Inc. ( 310 ) in
the State of Nevada on April 20, 2006. 310 had no significant activity from inception through 2009. In April 2009, John Bordynuik
purchased 63% of the issued and outstanding shares of 310. During 2009, the Company changed its name to JBI, Inc. and began operations
of its main business operation, transforming waste plastics to oil and other fuel products. During 2014, the Company changed its
name to Plastic2Oil, Inc. ( P2O ). P2O is a combination of proprietary technologies and processes developed by P2O
which convert waste plastics into fuel. P2O currently, as of the date of this filing, has two processors at its Niagara Falls,
NY facility (the  Niagara Falls Facility ). Both processors are currently idle since December 2013. Our P2O business
has begun the transition from research and development to a commercial manufacturing and production business. We plan to grow
mainly from sale of processors.  

Currently,
we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business which has forced us to suspend our operations until such time as we receive
a capital infusion or cash advances on the sale of our processors.  

Going
Concern   

These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ( US GAAP ), which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern which
assumes the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company
has experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception, has net losses from continuing operations of $2,934,327,
and $2,909,718, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and has a working capital deficit of $6,355,774
and an accumulated deficit of $75,178,424 at September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern and to operate in the normal course of business. The Company has funded its activities
to date almost exclusively from equity financings and loans from related parties.  

The
Company will continue to require substantial funds to continue the expansion of its P2O business to achieve commercial productions,
and to resume sales and marketing efforts. Management s plans in order to meet its operating cash flow requirements include
financing activities such as private placements of its common stock, issuances of debt and convertible debt instruments.  

While
the Company believes that it will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, meet regulatory requirements
and achieve commercial production goals, there are no assurances that such additional funding will be achieved and that it will
succeed in its future operations. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable
to continue in existence.  

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Consolidation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Plastic2Oil
of NY#1 Inc., Plastic2Oil (Canada) Inc., JBI CDE Inc., Plastic2Oil Re One Inc., JBI Re #1 Inc., Plastic2Oil Marine Inc., Javaco,
and Pak-it. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. Amounts in the consolidated financial
statements are expressed in US dollars. Pak-It and Javaco have also been condensed consolidated; however, as mentioned their operations
are classified as discontinued operations (see Note 12).  

Interim
Disclosure   

These
condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in considerably less detail than complete financial statements that
are intended to present financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. For this reason, they should be read in conjunction with the entity s most recent complete financial statements
included in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015 on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 31, 2016 that include
all the disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles.  

Management s
opinion that all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods have been made, and a statement
that all adjustments are of a normal recurring nature or a description of the nature and amount of any adjustments other than
normal recurring adjustments. 

Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. Significant estimates include amounts for impairment of long-lived assets, share based compensation, asset retirement
obligations, inventory obsolescence, accrued liabilities, accounts receivable exposures and valuation of options and warrants.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
  As of September 31, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the Company had $93,740 and $18,488, respectively,  

Restricted
Cash   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $100,398 and $100,322, respectively, of restricted cash, which is
used to secure a line of credit that secures a performance bond on behalf of the Company. The performance bond is required by
the State of New York for fuel distributors in perpetuity.  

Accounts
Receivable   

Accounts
receivable represent unsecured obligations due from customers under terms requesting payments upon receipt of invoice up to ninety
days, depending on the customer. Accounts receivable are non-interest bearing and are stated at the amounts billed to the customer
net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts. Customer balances with invoices over 90 days old are considered delinquent. Payments
of accounts receivable are applied to the specific invoices identified on the customer remittance, or if unspecified, are applied
to the earliest unpaid invoice.  

The
allowance for uncollectible accounts reflects management s best estimate of amounts that may not be collected based on an
analysis of the age of receivables and the credit standing of individual customers. The allowance for uncollectible accounts as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $22,994.  

Property,
Plant and Equipment   

Property,
plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the various classes of assets, and capital leased assets are given useful lives coinciding with the asset classification they
are classified as. These lives are as follows:  

Leasehold
    improvements   
         
      lesser
    of useful life or term of the lease   
 
      Machinery
    and office equipment   
         
      3-15
    years   
 
      Furniture
    and fixtures  
         
      7
    years   
 
      Office
    and industrial buildings  
         
      25
    -30 years   

Gains
and losses on depreciable assets retired or sold are recognized in the statements of operations in the year of disposal. Repairs
and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred and expenditures that increase the value or useful life of the asset are
capitalized.  

Construction
in Process   

The
Company capitalizes customized equipment built to be used in the future day to day operations at cost. Once complete and available
for use, the cost for accounting purposes is transferred to property, plant and equipment, where normal depreciation rates are
applied.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   

The
Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets on an asset by asset basis. Impairment is recognized on properties held for
use when the expected undiscounted cash flows for a property are less than its carrying amount at which time the property is written-down
to fair value. Properties held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs
to sell. The sale or disposal of a  component of an entity  is treated as discontinued operations. The operating properties
sold by the Company typically meet the definition of a component of an entity and as such the revenues and expenses associated
with sold properties are reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented (see Note 12).  

During
the period ended September, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of $1,020,349
and $0, respectively, in accordance with ASC 360-10-50-2 where an impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount
of the long-lived assets are not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of equipment for
impairment purposes using a discounted cash flow method.  

Asset
Retirement Obligations   

The
fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets when identified and a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement cost, equal to the estimated fair value of the asset retirement
obligation, is capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived asset. The balance of the asset retirement obligation
is determined through an assessment made by the Company s engineers, of the total costs expected to be incurred by the Company
when closing a facility. The total estimated cost is then discounted using the current market rates to determine the present value
of the asset as of the date of this valuation. As of the date of the creation of the asset retirement obligation in the amount
of $57,530, the Company determined the present value of the obligation using a discount rate equal to 2.96%. The present value
of the asset retirement obligation is then capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets and is depreciated over the asset s
estimated useful life and is included in depreciation and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Increases
in the asset retirement obligation resulting from the passage of time are recorded as accretion of asset retirement obligations
in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Actual expenditures incurred are charged against the accumulated obligation.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the asset retirement obligations was $41,923 and $41,000,
respectively. These costs include disposal of plastic and other non-hazardous waste, site closing labor and testing and sampling
of the site upon closure.  

Environmental
Contingencies   

The
Company records environmental liabilities at their undiscounted amounts on our balance sheets as other current or long-term liabilities
when environmental assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. These
costs may be discounted to reflect the time value of money if the timing of the cash payments is fixed or reliably determinable
and extends beyond a current period. Estimates of our liabilities are based on currently available facts, existing technology
and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into consideration the likely effects of other societal and economic factors,
and include estimates of associated legal costs. These amounts also consider prior experience in remediating contaminated sites,
other companies  clean-up experience and data released by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations.
Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances. We capitalize costs that benefit
future periods and we recognize a current period charge in operation and maintenance expense when clean-up efforts do not benefit
future periods.  

We
evaluate any amounts paid directly or reimbursed by government sponsored programs and potential recoveries or reimbursements of
remediation costs from third parties including insurance coverage separately from our liability. Recovery is evaluated based on
the creditworthiness or solvency of the third party, among other factors. When recovery is assured, we record and report an asset
separately from the associated liability on our balance sheets. No amounts for recovery have been accrued to date.  

Deposits   

Deposits
represent utility services deposit and payments made to vendors for fabrication of key pieces of property, plant and equipment
that have been made in accordance with the Company s agreements to purchase such equipment. Payments are made to these vendors
as progress is made on the fabrication of the equipment, with final payments made when the equipment is delivered. Until we have
possession of the equipment, all payments made to these vendors are classified as deposits on assets. Deposits were $1,476,126
and $1,484,438 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Leases   

The
Company has entered into various leases for buildings and equipment. At the inception of a lease, the Company evaluates whether
it is operating or capital in nature. Operating leases are recorded as expense in the appropriate periods of the lease. Capital
leases are classified as property, plant and equipment and the related depreciation is recorded on the assets. Also, the debt
related to the capital lease is included in the Company s short- and long-term debt obligations, in accordance with the
lease agreement (see Note 5).  

Lease
inducements are recognized for periods of reduced rent or for larger than usual rent escalations over the term of the lease. The
benefit of a rent free period and the cost of future rent escalations are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of
the lease.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and collection is reasonably assured. The Company considers revenue
realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
(ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable,
and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  

P2O
processor sales are recognized when the customer take possession of the processors since Title to the Goods and the risk of loss
transfers from P2O to Customer upon delivery. P2O fuel sales are recognized when the customers take possession of the fuel since
at that stage the customer has completed all prior testing necessary for their acceptance of the fuel. At the time of possession
they have arranged for transportation to pick it up and the sales price has either been set in their purchase contract or negotiated
prior to the time of pick up through the issuance of a purchase order. The Company negotiates the pricing of the fuel based on
the quality of the product and the type of fuel being sold (i.e. Naphtha, Fuel Oil No. 6 or Fuel Oil No. 2). The Company recognized
zero revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Advertising
costs   

The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were $0 and $1,868 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. These expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses   other, in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations.  

Research
and Development   

The
Company is engaged in research and development activities. Research and development costs are charged as operating expense of
the Company as incurred. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company expensed $0 and $1,653, respectively,
towards research and development costs. Components of the processors that are fabricated or purchased with research and development
plans and then used on the processor in production are capitalized into the cost of the processor and depreciated over the remaining
life of the processor.  

Foreign
Currency Translation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements have been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 830. All monetary items have been translated
using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. All non-monetary items have been translated using the historical
exchange rates at the time of transactions. Income statement amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for
the year. Resulting differences are immaterial to the financial statements as a whole. Foreign exchange losses of $96 and gain
of $6,425 are included as general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company utilizes the asset and liability method to measure and record deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets
are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  

The
Company adopted the accounting standards associated with uncertain tax positions as of January 1, 2007. The adoption of this standard
did not have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations or financial position. Upon
adoption, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. Furthermore, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company files tax returns in the U.S federal and state jurisdictions as well as a foreign
country. The years ended December 31, 2009 through December 31, 2015 are open tax years for IRS review.  

Loss
Per Share   

The
financial statements include basic and diluted per share information. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed
by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock
during each period. Common stock equivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share when their effect is
anti-dilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, potential dilutive common stock equivalents consisted of 14,550,000
shares underlying common stock warrants and 1,540,000 shares underlying stock options, which were not included in the calculation
of the diluted loss per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, potential dilutive common stock equivalents consisted
of 11,850,000 shares underlying common stock warrants, and 5,345,334 shares underlying stock options, which were not included
in the calculation of the diluted loss per share.  

Segment
Reporting   

The
Company operates in two reportable segments. ASC 280-10,  Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information ,
establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in their annual
consolidated financial statements. Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information
is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. Our operating segments include plastic to oil conversion (Plastic2Oil), which includes processor sales as well as
fuel sales and Data Recovery and Migration, our magnetic tape reading segment. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Company s
Chief Executive Officer.  

Concentrations
and Credit Risk   

Financial
instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of operating demand deposit
accounts and accounts receivable. The Company s policy is to place our operating demand deposit accounts with high credit
quality financial institutions that are insured by the FDIC, however, account balances may at times exceed insured limits. The
Company extends limited credit to its customers based upon their creditworthiness and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts
based upon the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other pertinent information. The Company also routinely
makes an assessment of the collectability of the short-term note receivable and determines its exposure for non-performance based
on the specific holder and other pertinent information.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, leases, promissory notes,
long-term debt and mortgage payable approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

On
May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard outlines
a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes
most current revenue recognition guidance. The accounting standard is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim
reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. The impact on our
Financial Statements of adopting ASU 2014-09 is being assessed by management.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This update requires an entity to
classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent within a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is
effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. This update may be applied either prospectively
to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early application is permitted as of the
beginning of the interim or annual reporting period. The impact on our Financial Statements of adopting ASU 2014-09 is being assessed
by management.  

In
July 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ( ASU 2015-11 ). ASU 2015-11 requires
that an entity measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This ASU does not apply to inventory measured
using last-in, first-out. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
periods within that reporting period. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a significant impact on its consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

In
August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date, which
defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The impact
on our Financial Statements of adopting ASU 2014-09 is being assessed by management.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material
effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

6   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

Commitments   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has committed to purchase certain pieces of key machinery from vendors related to the future
expansion of its operations. In addition to the payments made to these vendors classified as deposits on the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company will be required to pay approximately $495,000 upon the delivery of these assets.  

The
Company leased premises in Thorold, Ontario, Canada which was previously used in the operation Plastic2Oil (Canada), Inc. doing
business as Regional Recycling of Niagara ( RRON ). During the third quarter of 2013, the Company determined that
it would shut down the operations of RRON (see Note 12). The employees of RRON were given notice of the shut down in the first
week of September, after which point the Company approached the landlord about terminating the lease; however, there was no formal
termination as an agreement to terminate the lease was not reached. During September 2013, the Company was assessing its options
with the facility, including potential sublease, but determined that a sublease of the facility was not permitted by the lease
and officially decided to cease use of the premises as of September 30, 2013. Accordingly, the Company has applied September 30,
2013 as the cease-use-date in recognizing the liability for the contract termination costs. The property was vacated on November
10, 2015. On January 15, 2016, the Company entered into a Surrender of Lease agreement which terminated its lease, dated December
1, 2010, between Avondale Store Limited Properties and JBI, (Canada) Inc. relating to the Company s premises located at
1786 Allanport Road, Thorold, Canada. The effective date of the termination was October 31, 2015. The premises was the site of
the Company s Regional Recycling Center, which was part of a business line that was discontinued by the Company in 2013.
The Company anticipates the termination will save approximately $1,161,360 in lease payments over the original life of the lease
which had a term ending on December 1, 2030. The Company will remain liable for unpaid rent of approximately $43,875, covering
the period from May 2016 to October 2016.  

Contingencies   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company is involved in litigation and claims which arise from time to time in the normal course of
business. In the opinion of management, based upon the information and facts known to them, any liability that may arise from
such contingencies would not have a material adverse effect on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the
Company.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The
following management s discussion and analysis (the MD A ) of the results of operations of the Company should
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company, together with the accompanying notes, as well
as other financial information included elsewhere in this Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
certain risks and uncertainties, and that reflect estimates and assumptions. See the section titled,  Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  for more information on forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ
materially from those indicated in forward- looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially
from our forward-looking statements are described in  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A,of the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Report.   

Business
Overview   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has no revenue. The Company s P2O processors were idle for
all of 2015 and remained idle during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

For
financial reporting purposes, we operate in two business segments, (i) our P2O  solution business, which manufactures and
sells the fuel produced through our two operating P2O processors and (ii) data storage and recovery (the  Data Business ).
As of this filing date of the report, our two operating processors were idle and not producing fuel products. Previously, we operated
a recycling facility for waste paper fiber processing, a chemical processing and cleaning business, known as Pak-It, and a retail
and wholesale distribution business, known as Javaco, Inc. As of September 30, 2016, we had exited all of these businesses and
their results in all periods presented are classified as discontinued operations (see Note 12).  

Our
P2O business is a commercial manufacturing and production business. We plan to grow mainly from sale of processors, and secondarily
from the sale of fuel products. Historically, our revenues have been derived primarily from our other segments and products, including
those noted above as discontinued operations.  

The
following table highlights since inception the proceeds from financings, research and development expenditures, investment in
property, plant and equipment and fuel produced:  

Plastic2Oil
Business    

Our
P2O business has elements of both a recycling business and a fuel refiner/ production business, which makes it difficult to identify
and make direct comparisons to competitors. Both the recycling and energy sectors are characterized by rapid technological change.
Our future success will depend on our ability to achieve and maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances
in both of these sectors. We believe that our business currently faces competition in the plastics-to-energy market, including
competition from PK Clean, Vadxx Energy, Green Envirotec Holdings LLC, and RES polyflow, each of which has developed alternative
methods for obtaining and generating fuel from plastics. See  Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business . Because
P2O solution end products include a variety of fuels, we also face competition from the broader petroleum industry.  

We
continue our business strategy with the goal of becoming a leading North American company that transforms waste plastic into ultra-
clean, ultra-low sulphur fuel.  

When
in operation, we provide environmentally-friendly solutions through our processors and technologies. Our primary offering is our
Plastic2Oil , or P2O , solution, which is our proprietary process that converts waste plastic into fuel through a series
of chemical reactions (our  P2O business ). We collect mainly mixed plastics from commercial and industrial enterprises
that generate large amounts of waste plastic for use in our process.  

Generally,
this waste plastic would otherwise be sent to landfills and its disposal potentially can be quite costly for companies. We use
this waste plastic as feedstock to produce Fuel Oil No. 2, Naphtha, and Fuel Oil No. 6 for various uses by our customers. We own
our P2O processors and have the capability to produce and store the fuels at, and ship from, our facilities in Niagara Falls,
NY. We sell the fuels we produce to customers through two main distribution channels, fuel wholesalers and directly to commercial
and industrial end-users.  

Our
P2O processors have evolved to be modular solutions with the completion of processor #3 in 2013. We use third party contract manufacturers
for the manufacture of many of the key modular components of our processors, including the kilns and distillation towers as well
as certain other key components that require specialized machining and fabrication.  

Our
P2O business is a proprietary process that converts waste plastic into fuel through a series of chemical reactions. We began developing
this process in 2009 and began very limited production in late 2010 following our receipt of a consent order from the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation ( NYSDEC ) allowing us to commercially operate our first large-scale
P2O processor located at our Niagara Falls, New York facility. Currently, as of the filing of this report, we have three processors
and components for two additional processors at an outside vendor site which are included in the balance sheet as deposits. These
processors were idle for all of 2015 and remained idle for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our processors are capable
of producing Naphtha, Fuel Oil No. 2 and Fuel Oil No. 6. Our P2O process also produces two by-products, a reusable off-gas similar
to natural gas and a petcoke carbon residue. We sell our fuel products to fuel wholesalers and directly to commercial and industrial
end-users. We primarily use our off-gas product in our processing operations to fuel the burners in our P2O processors. We have
years of significant operating data and have solved numerous challenges that have blocked competitor success. Since inception
we have produced a total of 667,996 gallons of fuel.  

Listing
on the OTCQB    

At
November 21, 2016, we had 124,756,158 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Our common stock is currently trading on
the OTCQB marketplace in the United States of America under the stock ticker symbol  PTOI.  On November 18, 2016,
the last trading day prior to the date of this filing, the closing price of the common stock on the OTCQB was $0.05.

of Revenues and Expenses   

Results
of Operations   Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015.   

Revenue   

As
we only recently shifted our business strategy to selling fuel processors, we did not derive any revenue from processor sales
in 2015 or during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We did not derive any revenue from our Data Business for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016.  

We
had no fuel production or processor sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Consequently, there was neither fuel shipment
nor fuel revenue. This was mainly due to management s decision to shut down its production in the fourth quarter of 2013
due to the severe cold weather that caused damage to condensers and other components of our processors and the lack of operating
cash. The damage requires substantial working capital for general repairs and replacement of damaged condensers and we have been
unable to obtain the financing necessary to make these repairs. These processors were idle for all of 2014, and 2015 and remain
idle through the date of this filing. Management estimates the processors will remain idle until the company can raise additional
capital, Fuel revenues are based on either a set pricing structure with our customers or the prevailing market rate for the specific
type of fuel being sold. Our fuels are usually sold under both long term sale contracts with specified pricing or through the
issuance of purchase orders by our customers. Generally, we are able to obtain a higher price per gallon for our Fuel Oil No.
2 as compared to Fuel Oil No. 6, and a significantly lower pricing for our Naphtha.  

As
indicated earlier, we did not produce any fuel in 2016 and 2015 and we had no revenue from our Data Business segment for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company s operating expenses consisted of the following:  

Operating
Expenses   

We
incurred operating expenses of $1,353,900 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,467,521 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. This $1,119,403 decrease was driven by a $414,318 professional fees decrease from elimination
of outside consultants, a $243,009 reduction in compensation from employee layoffs and $462,076 reduction of additional operational
expenses. In 2015 operational costs included approximately $320,000 from the settlement of the class action suit. Tight control
on costs provided the approximately $142,076 of additional reduction in operating expenses.  

Non-Operating
Expenses    

Interest
Expenses   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred net interest expense of $560,044 as compared to $447,669 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 mostly on the related party secured promissory and short term notes.  

Income
Tax Expenses   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, we had no federal taxable income due to net losses and recorded a deferred
tax asset and a valuation allowance to the extent that those assets are attributable to net operating losses. We recognized the
valuation allowance because we are unsure as to the ability to use these assets in the near future due to continued operating
losses.  

Net
Loss   

We
incurred a net loss of $2,934,327 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net loss of $2,944,131 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. These losses consisted of losses from continuing operations of $2,934,327 and $2,909,718
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and losses from discontinued operations of $0 and $34,413
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We
do not have sufficient cash to operate our business which has forced us to suspend our operations until such time as we receive
a capital infusion or cash advances on the sale of our processors. We intend to source additional capital through the sale of
our equity and debt securities and other financing methods. We plan to use the cash proceeds from any financing to complete the
repairs on Processors #3 to resume production of fuels for pilot runs and customer demonstrations. At September 30, 2016, we had
a cash balance of $93,740. Our principal sources of liquidity in 2016 were the proceeds from the related-party short-term loans
from our chief executive officer and the sale and issuance of secured promissory notes to other investors.  

As
discussed earlier in this MD A, our processors are currently idle and, thus, we are not producing fuel or generating fuel
sales or processor sales. Our current cash levels are not sufficient to enable us to make the required repairs to our processors
or to execute our business strategy as described in this Report. As a result, we intend to seek significant additional capital
through the sale of our equity and debt securities and other financing methods to enable us to make the repairs, to meet ongoing
operating costs and reduce existing liabilities. We also intend to seek cash advances or deposits under any new processor sale
agreements and/or related technology licenses. Management currently anticipates that the processors will remain idle until the
company can raise additional capital. Due to the many factors and uncertainties involved in capital markets transactions, there
can be no assurance that we will raise sufficient capital to allow us to resume operations in 2016, or at all. In the interim,
we anticipate that our level of operations will continue to be nominal, although we plan to continue to market our P2O processors
with the intention of making P2O processor sales and technology licenses.  

Our
limited capital resources, lack of Revenue and recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.  

Cash
Flow from Operations    

Cash
used in operations was $609,169 and $1,444,324 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2016 and
2015 cash was mainly used to continue funding the minimum operating costs. The drop in cash used is from a reduction in personnel,
less use of professional consultants and tighter spending control.  

Cash
Flow from Investing Activities    

Cash
flow from investing activities was $51, and $67, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively from an increase
in restricted cash.  

Cash
Flow from Financing Activities    

Cash
flow from financing activities was $684,472, and $1,305,247, for the nine months September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For
2016 and 2015, these amounts were mainly driven by the proceeds received from short-term notes from related parties. In 2016 $200,000
were from non-affiliated other investors.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Transactions
with Related Parties   

From
June 2014 to September 30, 2016, Mr. Heddle, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, made several personal loans to the company
to provide working capital. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance including accrued
interest at 4% per annum was $1,716,173 and $1,593,291 respectively. (See Note 4).  

From
January 2016 to September 30, 2016, Mr. Heddle, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, made several personal loans to the
company to provide working capital. At September 30, 2016, the aggregate outstanding balance including accrued interest at 12%
per annum was $564,739. (See Note 4).  

At
September 30, 2016, the company s accounts payable and accrued expenses included a $132,218 outstanding balance due to Heddle
Marine Services, a business controlled by Mr. Richard Heddle, the company s Chief Executive Officer and member of the Company s
board of directors. The amounts payable arose from payments made in 2014 by Heddle Marine on behalf of the company to a logistics
company to transport fuel from the Niagara Falls site to the blending tanks at our facility in Thorold, Ontario, as well as for
labor and material provided by Heddle Marine towards upkeep of our Canadian facilities including 2015 cleanup costs incurred in
order to terminate the lease with Avondale properties on the discontinued RRON Operation.  

In
November 2014, we entered into a Subscription Agreement with Heddle Marine Services, a business controlled by Mr. Richard Heddle,
the Company s Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Company s board of directors, pursuant to which we issued
to Heddle Marine a $1 million principal amount 12% Secured Promissory Note, together with a five-year warrant to purchase up to
one million shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.12 per share.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

Basis
of Consolidation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Plastic2Oil
(Canada) Inc., JBI CDE Inc., Plastic2Oil Re One Inc., and JBI Re #1 Inc., Plastic2Oil of NY #1, and Plastic2Oil Marine Inc.. The
results of Javaco and Pak-It are consolidated and classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented (See Note 12).
All of our intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. Amounts in the consolidated financial
statements are expressed in U.S. dollars.  

Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. Significant estimates include amounts for impairment of long-lives assets, share based compensation, asset retirement
obligations, inventory obsolescence, accrued liabilities and accounts receivable exposures.  

Accounts
Receivable   

Accounts
receivable represent unsecured obligations due from customers under terms requesting payments upon receipt of invoices up to ninety
days, depending on the customer. Accounts receivable are non-interest bearing and are stated at the amounts billed to the customer
net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts. Customer balances with invoices over 90 days old are considered delinquent. Payments
of accounts receivable are applied to the specific invoices identified on the customer remittance, or if unspecified, are applied
to the earliest unpaid invoice.  

Property
Plant and Equipment   

Property,
Plant and Equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the various classes of assets as follows:  

Leasehold
    improvements  
         
      lesser
    of useful life or term of the lease   
 
      Machinery
    and office equipment  
         
      3-15
    years   
 
      Furniture
    and fixtures  
         
      7
    years   
 
      Office
    and industrial buildings  
         
      25-30
    years   

Gains
and losses on depreciable assets retired or sold are recognized in the statement of operations in the year of disposal. Repairs
and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred and expenditures that increase the value or useful life of the asset are
capitalized.  

Construction
in Process   

The
Company capitalizes customized equipment built to be used in the future day to day operations at cost. Once complete and available
for use, the cost for accounting purposes is transferred to property, plant and equipment, where normal depreciation rates are
applied.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   

The
Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets on an asset by asset basis. Impairment is recognized on properties held for
use when the expected undiscounted cash flows for a property are less than its carrying amount at which time the property is written-down
to fair value. Properties held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs
to sell. The sale or disposal of a  component of an entity  is treated as discontinued operations. The operating properties
sold by the Company typically meet the definition of a component of an entity and as such the revenues and expenses associated
with sold properties are reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented (See Note 12).  

During
the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of $1,020,349
and $0, respectively, in accordance to ASC 360-10-50-2 where an impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount
of the long-lived assets are not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of equipment for
impairment purposes using a discounted cash flow method.  

Asset
Retirement Obligations   

The
fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets when identified and a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement cost, equal to the estimated fair value of the asset retirement
obligation, is capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived asset. The balance of the asset retirement obligation
is determined through an assessment made by the Company s engineers, of the total costs expected to be incurred by the Company
when closing a facility. The total estimated cost is then discounted using the current market rates to determine the present value
of the asset as of the date of this valuation. As of the date of the creation of the asset retirement obligation in the amount
of $57,530, the Company determined the present value of the obligation using a discount rate equal to 2.96%. The present value
of the asset retirement obligation is then capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets and is depreciated over the asset s
estimated useful life and is included in depreciation and accretion expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements
of operations. Increases in the asset retirement obligation resulting from the passage of time are recorded as accretion of asset
retirement obligations in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Actual expenditures incurred are charged
against the accumulated obligations.  

Environmental
Contingencies   

The
Company records environmental liabilities at their undiscounted amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as other current or
long-term liabilities when environmental assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated. These costs may be discounted to reflect the time value of money if the timing of the cash payments is fixed or reliably
determinable and extends beyond a current period. Estimates of our liabilities are based on currently available facts, existing
technology and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into consideration the likely effects of other societal and economic
factors, and include estimates of associated legal costs. These amounts also consider prior experience in remediating contaminated
sites, other companies  clean-up experience and data released by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations.
Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances. We capitalize costs that benefit
future periods and we recognize a current period charge in operation and maintenance expense when clean-up efforts do not benefit
future periods.  

We
evaluate any amounts paid directly or reimbursed by government sponsored programs and potential recoveries or reimbursements of
remediation costs from third parties including insurance coverage separately from our liability. Recovery is evaluated based on
the creditworthiness or solvency of the third party, among other factors. When recovery is assured, we record and report an asset
separately from the associated liability on our balance sheet. No amounts for recovery have been accrued to date.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and collection is reasonably assured. The Company considers revenue
realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
(ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable,
and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  

P2O
processor sales are recognized when the customer take possession of the processors since title to the goods and the risk of loss
transfers from P2O to Customer upon delivery. P2O fuel sales are recognized when the customers take possession of the fuel since
at that stage the customer has completed all prior testing necessary for their acceptance of the fuel. At the time of possession
they have arranged for transportation to pick it up and the sales price has either been set in contract or negotiated prior to
the time of pick up. The Company negotiates the pricing of the fuel based on the quality of the product and the type of fuel being
sold (e.g. Naphtha, Fuel Oil No.6 or Fuel Oil No. 2).  

Foreign
Currency Translation   

The
consolidated financial statements have been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 830. All monetary items have been translated
using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. All non-monetary items have been translated using the historical
exchange rates at the time of transactions. Income statement amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for
the year. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Resulting differences are
reflected in accum6ulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Foreign exchange loss of
$9 and gain of $6,425 for monetary items are included as general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements
of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

ITEM
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

Disclosures
About Market Risk    

We
may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business. Market risk generally represents the
risk that losses may occur as a result of movements in interest rates and equity prices. We currently do not use financial instruments
in the normal course of business that are subject to changes in financial market conditions.  

Currency
Fluctuations and Foreign Currency Risk    

We
mainly operate in the United States and Canada. Due to the relative stability of the Canadian Dollar in comparison to the U.S.
Dollar, we have not experienced foreign currency risk, however, should this stability change, we could be exposed to such risk.  

Interest
Rate Risk    

We
do not feel that we are subject to significant interest rate risk. We deposit surplus funds with banks earning daily interest
at fixed rates and we do not invest in any instruments for trading purposes. Additionally, all of our outstanding debt instruments
(our mortgage and capital leases) carry fixed rates of interests. We are exposed to opportunity risk should interest rates decrease.
The amount of interest bearing short-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $2,280,912 and $1,593,291,
respectively.  

Credit
Risk    

Financial
instruments which potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of operating demand deposit accounts
and accounts receivable. Our policy is to place our operating demand deposit accounts with high credit quality financial institutions
that are insured by the FDIC, however, account balances may at times exceed insured limits. We extend limited credit to our customers
based upon their creditworthiness and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the credit risk of specific customers,
historical trends and other pertinent information.  

We
maintain cash balances, at times, with financial institutions in excess of amounts insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation
and the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Management monitors the soundness of these institutions and has not experienced
any collection losses with these financial institutions.  

Inflation
Risk    

Inflationary
factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we
do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate
of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general
and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased
costs.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures   

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and
Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of September
30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September
30, 2016 our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

The
Company currently has just two directors, one of whom is member of executive management and not independent, the Company does
not maintain separately designated audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees of the Board.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management has reported to the Board of
Directors material weaknesses described under the heading Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
in Section 9A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

CERTIFICATION
OF PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER   

   PURSUANT
TO SECTION 302   

   OF
THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002   

I,
Richard Heddle, certify that:  

1.  
      I have reviewed
    this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Plastic2Oil, Inc.   

2.  
      Based on my knowledge,
    this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
    to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
    to the period covered by this quarterly report;   

3.  
      Based on my knowledge,
    the financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material
    respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented
    in this quarterly report;   

4.  
      The registrant s
    other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
    in Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-
    15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:   

a)  
      designed such disclosure
    controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure
    that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others
    within those entities, particularly during the period in which this quarterly report is being prepared;   

b)  
      designed such internal
    control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision,
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

c)  
      evaluated the effectiveness
    of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
    of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and   

d)  
      disclosed in this
    report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
    most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s
    internal control over financial reporting, and;   

5.  
      The registrant s
    other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting,
    to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing
    the equivalent functions):   

a)

    and   

b)  
      any fraud, whether
    or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal
