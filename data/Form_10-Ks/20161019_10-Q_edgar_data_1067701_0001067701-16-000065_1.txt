CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the  safe harbor  provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as  believe,   expect,   may,   will,   should,   seek,   on-track,   plan,   project,   forecast,   intend  or  anticipate,  or the negative thereof or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy or outlook. You are cautioned that our business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and, consequently, our actual results may differ materially from those projected.  
    
  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected include, but are not limited to, the following:  

the possibility that companies that we have acquired or may acquire, in our specialty business or otherwise, could have undiscovered liabilities or involve other unexpected costs, may strain our management capabilities or may be difficult to integrate; 
                
    the cyclical nature of our business, which is highly sensitive to North American construction and industrial activities; if construction or industrial activity decline, our revenues and, because many of our costs are fixed, our profitability may be adversely affected; 
                
    our significant indebtedness (which totaled $  8.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  ) requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow for debt service and can constrain our flexibility in responding to unanticipated or adverse business conditions; 
                
    inability to refinance our indebtedness on terms that are favorable to us, or at all; 
                
    incurrence of additional debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness; 
                
    noncompliance with financial or other covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in our lenders terminating the agreements and requiring us to repay outstanding borrowings; 
                
    restrictive covenants and amount of borrowings permitted in our debt instruments, which can limit our financial and operational flexibility; 
                
    overcapacity of fleet in the equipment rental industry; 
                
    inability to benefit from government spending, including spending associated with infrastructure projects; 
                
    fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock repurchases in the time frame and/or on the terms anticipated; 
                
    rates we charge and time utilization we achieve being less than anticipated; 
                
    inability to manage credit risk adequately or to collect on contracts with a large number of customers; 
                
    inability to access the capital that our businesses or growth plans may require; 
                
    incurrence of impairment charges;  
                
    trends in oil and natural gas could adversely affect the demand for our services and products; 
                
    the fact that our holding company structure requires us to depend in part on distributions from subsidiaries and such distributions could be limited by contractual or legal restrictions; 
                
    increases in our loss reserves to address business operations or other claims and any claims that exceed our established levels of reserves; 
                
    incurrence of additional expenses (including indemnification obligations) and other costs in connection with litigation, regulatory and investigatory matters; 
                
    the outcome or other potential consequences of regulatory matters and commercial litigation; 
                
    shortfalls in our insurance coverage; 
                
    our charter provisions as well as provisions of certain debt agreements and our significant indebtedness may have the effect of making more difficult or otherwise discouraging, delaying or deterring a takeover or other change of control of us; 
                
    turnover in our management team and inability to attract and retain key personnel; 
                
    costs we incur being more than anticipated, and the inability to realize expected savings in the amounts or time frames planned; 
                
    dependence on key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms; 
                
    inability to sell our new or used fleet in the amounts, or at the prices, we expect; 
                
    competition from existing and new competitors; 
                
    risks related to security breaches, cybersecurity attacks and other significant disruptions in our information technology systems; 
                
    the costs of complying with environmental, safety and foreign law and regulations, as well as other risks associated with non-U.S. operations, including currency exchange risk; 
     
   3 

     Table of Contents  

labor disputes, work stoppages or other labor difficulties, which may impact our productivity, and potential enactment of new legislation or other changes in law affecting our labor relations or operations generally; and 
                
    increases in our maintenance and replacement costs and/or decreases in the residual value of our equipment. 
       
  For a more complete description of these and other possible risks and uncertainties, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as well as to our subsequent filings with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements contained herein speak only as of the date hereof, and we make no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations.

  1  . Organization, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
  United Rentals, Inc. ( Holdings,   URI  or the  Company ) is principally a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary, United Rentals (North America), Inc. ( URNA ), and subsidiaries of URNA. Holdings  primary asset is its sole ownership of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of URNA. URNA s various credit agreements and debt instruments place restrictions on its ability to transfer funds to its shareholder. 
  We rent equipment to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and government entities in the United States and Canada. In addition to renting equipment, we sell new and used rental equipment, as well as related contractor supplies, parts and service. 
  We have prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the accounting policies described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the    2015   Form 10-K ) and the interim reporting requirements of Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the   2015   Form 10-K.  
  In our opinion, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a fair presentation of financial condition, operating results and cash flows for the interim periods presented have been made. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results of the full year.  
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements  
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . In May 2014, and in subsequent updates, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue. This guidance includes the required steps to achieve the core principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The FASB has agreed to a one-year deferral of the original effective date of this guidance and as a result it will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The FASB's update allows entities to apply the new guidance as of the original effective date (for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016). We expect to adopt this guidance when effective, and the impact on our financial statements is not currently estimable. 
  Leases  . In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance ( Topic 842 ) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring i) recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and ii) disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. The accounting applied by lessors under Topic 842 is largely unchanged from previous GAAP. Some changes to the lessor accounting guidance were made to align both of the following: i) the lessor accounting guidance with certain changes made to the lessee accounting guidance and ii) key aspects of the lessor accounting model with revenue recognition guidance. Topic 842 will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective approach is required for adoption for all leases that exist at or commence after the date of initial application with an option to use certain practical expedients. We are currently assessing whether we will early adopt, and the impact on our financial statements is not currently estimable. 
  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. Different components of the guidance require prospective, retrospective and/or modified retrospective adoption. We expect to adopt this guidance when effective, and do not expect the guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 
  Statement of Cash Flows.   In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance to reduce the diversity in the presentation of certain cash receipts and cash payments presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5) proceeds from settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (6) distributions received from equity method investees, (7) beneficial interests in securitization transitions and (8)

separately identifiable cash flows and application of predominance principle. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance requires retrospective adoption. We are currently assessing whether we will early adopt, and the impact on our financial statements is not currently estimable.  
   
  2  . Segment Information 
  Our reportable segments are i) general rentals and ii) trench, power and pump. The general rentals segment includes the rental of i) general construction and industrial equipment, such as backhoes, skid-steer loaders, forklifts, earthmoving equipment and material handling equipment, ii) aerial work platforms, such as boom lifts and scissor lifts and iii) general tools and light equipment, such as pressure washers, water pumps and power tools. The general rentals segment reflects the aggregation of   nine   geographic regions Industrial (which serves the geographic Gulf region and has a strong industrial presence), Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Northeast, Pacific West, South-Central, South, Southeast and Western Canada and operates throughout the United States and Canada.  
  The trench, power and pump segment includes the rental of specialty construction products such as i) trench safety equipment, such as trench shields, aluminum hydraulic shoring systems, slide rails, crossing plates, construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work, ii) power and HVAC equipment, such as portable diesel generators, electrical distribution equipment, and temperature control equipment and iii) pumps primarily used by municipalities, industrial plants, and mining, construction, and agribusiness customers. The trench, power and pump segment is comprised of the following regions, each of which primarily rents the corresponding equipment type described above: (i) the Trench Safety region, (ii) the Power and HVAC region, and (iii) the Pump Solutions region. The trench, power and pump segment s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects, municipalities and industrial companies. This segment operates throughout the United States and in Canada. 
  These segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates and allocates resources. We evaluate segment performance based on segment equipment rentals gross profit.

Equipment rentals gross profit is the primary measure management reviews to make operating decisions and assess segment performance. The following is a reconciliation of equipment rentals gross profit to income before provision for income taxes:    

3  . Restructuring Charges 
  Closed Restructuring Programs 
  We have   two   closed restructuring programs. The first was initiated in 2008 in recognition of a challenging economic environment and was completed in 2011. The second closed restructuring program was initiated following the April 30, 2012 acquisition of RSC Holdings Inc. ("RSC"), and was completed in 2013. The restructuring charges under the closed restructuring programs include severance costs associated with headcount reductions, as well as branch closure charges which principally relate to continuing lease obligations at vacant facilities.   
  2015-2016 Cost Savings Restructuring Program 
  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a restructuring program in response to challenges in our operating environment. In particular, during 2015, we experienced volume and pricing pressure in our general rental business and our Pump Solutions region associated with upstream oil and gas customers. Additionally, our Lean initiatives did not fully generate the anticipated cost savings due to lower than expected growth. Though we expect solid industry growth in the foreseeable future, the restructuring program was initiated in an effort to reduce costs in an environment with continuing pressures on volume and pricing. We expect to complete the restructuring program in 2016, and expect the total costs incurred under the program to be approximately   $20  , including   $11   recognized through   September 30, 2016  .  
  The table below provides certain information concerning our restructuring charges for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :

    Reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of income as  Restructuring charge.  These charges are not allocated to our reportable segments.    
      
  4  . Derivatives 
  We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value, and recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments based on the designation of the derivative. We are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the risks we managed using derivative instruments were diesel price risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. At   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding fixed price swap contracts on diesel purchases which were entered into to mitigate the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of diesel. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we entered into forward contracts to purchase Canadian dollars to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans. There were no outstanding forward contracts to purchase Canadian dollars at   September 30, 2016  .  
  Fixed Price Diesel Swaps 
  The fixed price swap contracts on diesel purchases that were outstanding at   September 30, 2016   were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings (i.e., when the hedged gallons of diesel are used). The remaining gain or loss on the fixed price swap contracts in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item, if any (i.e., the ineffective portion), is recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income during the current period. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding fixed price swap contracts covering   9.8 million   gallons of diesel which will be purchased throughout   2016  ,   2017   and 2018. 
  Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
  The forward contracts to purchase Canadian dollars, which were all settled as of   September 30, 2016  , represented derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments and gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of the forward contracts were recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income during the period in which the changes in fair value occurred. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , forward contracts were used to purchase $  301   and $  552   Canadian dollars, respectively, representing the total amount due at maturity for certain Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were settled during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Upon maturity, the proceeds from the forward contracts were used to pay down the Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans.

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , immaterial amounts (  $6   or less) were reflected in prepaid expenses and other assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and accumulated other comprehensive income in our condensed consolidated balance sheets associated with the outstanding fixed price swap contracts that were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. 
  The effect of our derivative instruments on our condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows:

5  . Fair Value Measurements 
  We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of the following three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety: 
  Level 1- Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2- Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities include: 
           a) 
    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; 
              b) 
    quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; 
              c) 
    inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; 
              d) 
    inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 
     If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
  Level 3- Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity) and significant to the fair value measure. 
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our only assets and liabilities measured at fair value were our fixed price diesel swaps contracts, which are Level 2 derivatives measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , immaterial amounts (  $6   or less) were reflected in prepaid expenses and other assets, and accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, reflecting the fair values of the fixed price diesel swaps contracts. As discussed in note   4   to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we entered into the fixed price swap contracts on diesel purchases to mitigate the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of diesel. Fair value is determined based on observable market data. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have fixed price swap contracts that mature throughout   2016  ,   2017   and 2018 covering   9.8 million   gallons of diesel which we will buy at the average contract price of   $2.60   per gallon, while the average forward price for the hedged gallons was   $2.56   per gallon as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The carrying amounts reported in our condensed consolidated balance sheets for accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to the immediate to short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The fair values of our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility ( ABL facility ), accounts receivable securitization facility and capital leases approximated their book values as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The estimated fair values of our financial instruments, all of which are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   have been calculated based upon available market information, and were as follows:    

6  . Debt 
  Debt, net of unamortized original issue discounts or premiums, and unamortized debt issuance costs, consists of the following:

           (1) 
    In August 2016, the accounts receivable securitization facility was amended, primarily to extend the maturity date. The amended facility expires on August 29, 2017 and may be further extended on a   364  -day basis by mutual agreement with the purchasers under the accounts receivable securitization facility. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $44   was available under our accounts receivable securitization facility. The interest rate applicable to the accounts receivable securitization facility was   1.4   percent at   September 30, 2016  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the monthly average amount outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility was   $539  , and the weighted-average interest rate thereon was   1.2 percent  . The maximum month-end amount outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $580  . Borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility are permitted only to the extent that the face amount of the receivables in the collateral pool, net of applicable reserves, exceeds the outstanding loans. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were $  623   of receivables, net of applicable reserves, in the collateral pool.  
              (2) 
    At   September 30, 2016  ,   $716   was available under our ABL facility, net of   $37   of letters of credit. The interest rate applicable to the ABL facility was   2.0 percent   at   September 30, 2016  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the monthly average amount outstanding under the ABL facility was   $1.4   billion, and the weighted-average interest rate thereon was   2.1 percent  . The maximum month-end amount outstanding under the ABL facility during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.7 billion  . In June 2016, the ABL facility was amended, primarily to extend the maturity date. All amounts borrowed under the ABL facility must be repaid by June 2021.  
              (3) 
    In May 2016, we redeemed all of our 8    1   /   4    percent Senior Notes and $  550   principal amount of our 7    3   /   8    percent Senior Notes. Upon redemption, we recognized an aggregate loss of $  25   in interest expense, net. The loss represented the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the notes. In August 2016, we redeemed the remaining $  200   principal amount of our 7    3   /   8    percent Senior Notes using borrowings available under our ABL facility. We recognized a loss representing the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the notes of $  10   in interest expense, net upon redemption. 
              (4) 
    In May 2016, URNA issued $  750   aggregate principal amount of 5    7   /   8    percent Senior Notes (the  5    7   /   8    percent Notes ) which are due September 15, 2026. The net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $  741   (after deducting offering expenses). The 5    7   /   8    percent Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by Holdings and certain domestic subsidiaries of URNA. The 5    7   /   8    percent Notes may be redeemed on or after   September 15, 2021  , at specified redemption prices that range from   102.938   percent in 2021, to   100   percent in 2024 and thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The indenture governing the 5    7   /   8    percent Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including, among others, limitations on (i) liens; (ii) additional indebtedness; (iii) mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; (iv) sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets; (v) loans and other investments; (vi) dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments; (vii) restrictions affecting subsidiaries; (viii) transactions with affiliates; and (ix) designations of unrestricted subsidiaries, as well as a requirement to timely file periodic reports with the SEC. Each of the restrictive covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications that would allow URNA and its subsidiaries to engage in these activities under certain conditions. The indenture also requires that, in the event of a

change of control (as defined in the indenture), URNA must make an offer to purchase all of the then-outstanding 5    7   /   8    percent Notes tendered at a purchase price in cash equal to   101   percent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon. 
           (5) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , our short-term debt primarily reflects $  579   of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility. 
     Loan Covenants and Compliance 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the ABL facility, the accounts receivable securitization facility and the senior notes. Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations. 
  The only financial covenant that currently exists under the ABL facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio. Subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the ABL facility, the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the ABL facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the ABL facility falls below   10 percent   of the maximum revolver amount under the ABL facility. When certain conditions are met, cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the ABL facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the ABL facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , specified availability under the ABL facility exceeded the required threshold and, as a result, this maintenance covenant was inapplicable. Under our accounts receivable securitization facility, we are required, among other things, to maintain certain financial tests relating to: (i) the default ratio, (ii) the delinquency ratio, (iii) the dilution ratio and (iv) days sales outstanding. The accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the ABL facility, to the extent the ratio is applicable under the ABL facility. 
   
  7  . Legal and Regulatory Matters 
  We are subject to a number of claims and proceedings that generally arise in the ordinary course of our business. These matters include, but are not limited to, general liability claims (including personal injury, property and auto claims), indemnification and guarantee obligations, employee injuries and employment-related claims, self-insurance obligations, contract and real estate matters, and other general business litigation. Based on advice of counsel and available information, including current status or stage of proceeding, and taking into account accruals for matters where we have established them, we currently believe that any liabilities ultimately resulting from such claims and proceedings will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  8  . Earnings Per Share 
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (shares in thousands):

9  . Condensed Consolidating Financial Information of Guarantor Subsidiaries 
  URNA is   100 percent   owned by Holdings ( Parent ) and, as of   September 30, 2016   and/or   December 31, 2015  , had outstanding (i) certain indebtedness that is guaranteed by both Parent and, with the exception of its U.S. special purpose vehicle which holds receivable assets relating to the Company s accounts receivable securitization facility (the  SPV ), all of URNA s U.S. subsidiaries (the  guarantor subsidiaries ) and (ii) certain indebtedness that was guaranteed only by the guarantor subsidiaries (specifically, the 8    1   /  4   percent Senior Notes). As discussed in note   6   to the condensed consolidated financial statements, in May 2016, all of the 8    1   /   4    percent Senior Notes were redeemed. Other than the guarantee by certain Canadian subsidiaries of URNA's indebtedness under the ABL facility, none of URNA s indebtedness is guaranteed by URNA's foreign subsidiaries or the SPV (together, the  non-guarantor subsidiaries ). The receivable assets owned by the SPV have been sold or contributed by URNA to the SPV and are not available to satisfy the obligations of URNA or Parent s other subsidiaries. The guarantor subsidiaries are all   100 percent  -owned and the guarantees are made on a joint and several basis. The guarantees are not full and unconditional because a guarantor subsidiary can be automatically released and relieved of its obligations under certain circumstances, including sale of the guarantor subsidiary, the sale of all or substantially all of the guarantor subsidiary's assets, the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the applicable indenture being met or designating the guarantor subsidiary as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the applicable covenants. The guarantees are also subject to subordination provisions (to the same extent that the obligations of the issuer under the relevant notes are subordinated to other debt of the issuer) and to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by each guarantor will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws. Based on our understanding of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X ("Rule 3-10"), we believe that the guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries comply with the conditions set forth in Rule 3-10 and therefore continue to utilize Rule 3-10 to present condensed consolidating financial information for Holdings, URNA, the guarantor subsidiaries and the non-guarantor subsidiaries. Separate consolidated financial statements of the guarantor subsidiaries have not been presented because management believes that such information would not be material to investors. However, condensed consolidating financial information is presented.   
  URNA covenants in the ABL facility, accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt impose operating and financial restrictions on URNA, Parent and the guarantor subsidiaries, including limitations on the ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount available for distribution under the most restrictive of these covenants was $  332  . The Company s total available capacity for making share repurchases and dividend payments includes the intercompany receivable balance of Parent. As of   September 30, 2016  , our total available capacity for making share repurchases and dividend payments, which includes URNA s capacity to make restricted payments and the intercompany receivable balance of Parent, was   $561  .  
  The condensed consolidating financial information of Parent and its subsidiaries is as follows:

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise indicated) 
     Executive Overview 
  We are the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of   890   rental locations in the United States and Canada. Although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse, we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because, as a larger company, we have more extensive resources and certain competitive advantages. These include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost ( OEC ) of   $9.2 billion  , and a national branch network that operates in 49 U.S. states and every Canadian province, and serves 99 of the largest 100 metropolitan areas in the United States. In addition, our size gives us greater purchasing power, the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services, the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently well-maintained and therefore more productive and reliable, and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs. 
  We offer approximately   3,200   classes of equipment for rent to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and government entities. Our revenues are derived from the following sources: equipment rentals, sales of rental equipment, sales of new equipment, contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues. Equipment rentals represented   86   percent of total revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency.  
  In 2016, we have continued our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital. In particular, our strategy calls for: 
             
    A consistently superior standard of service to customers  , often provided through a single point of contact; 
                
    The further optimization of our customer mix and fleet mix,   with a dual objective: to enhance our performance in serving our current customer base, and to focus on the accounts and customer types that are best suited to our strategy for profitable growth. We believe these efforts will lead to even better service of our target accounts, primarily large construction and industrial customers, as well as select local contractors. Our fleet team's analyses are aligned with these objectives to identify trends in equipment categories and define action plans that can generate improved returns; 
                
    The implementation of  Lean  management techniques, including kaizen processes focused on continuous improvement, through a program we call Operation United 2  . We have trained over 3,100 employees, over 70 percent of our district managers and over 60 percent of our branch managers on the Lean kaizen process. We continue to implement this program across our branch network, with the objectives of: reducing the cycle time associated with renting our equipment to customers; improving invoice accuracy and service quality; reducing the elapsed time for equipment pickup and delivery; and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our repair and maintenance operations. As discussed in note   3   to our condensed consolidated financial statements, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a restructuring program focused on cost savings throughout the organization partially due to the Lean initiatives not fully generating the anticipated cost savings due to lower than expected rental volume in 2015. The savings generated from Lean initiatives are partially dependent on rental volume, and, though we have not yet achieved the anticipated level of Lean savings, we expect to continue to achieve savings through the Lean initiatives; and 
                
    The continued expansion of our trench, power and pump footprint, as well as our tools offering, and the cross-selling of these services throughout our network  . We believe that the expansion of our trench, power and pump business, as well as our tools offering, will further position United Rentals as a single source provider of total jobsite solutions through our extensive product and service resources and technology offerings.  
     For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , equipment rental revenue decreased   0.8   percent as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily reflecting a   2.2   percent rental rate decrease partially offset by a   2.6   percent increase in the volume of OEC on rent, which included the adverse impact of currency. Excluding the adverse impact from currency, rental revenue would have decreased   0.3   percent year-over-year. Rental rate changes are calculated based on the year-over-year variance in average contract rates, weighted by the prior period revenue mix. We expect the combination of recent industry fleet expansion and continuing softness in Canada and the oil and gas sector to continue to place pressure on volume and pricing, though we expect solid industry growth in the foreseeable future. We believe that the factors that contribute to the rental rate pressures are largely temporary. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   we experienced strong demand in many of our core markets, as evidenced by the increase in the volume of OEC on rent.

Although we experienced rate pressures during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and expect that these pressures will continue for the remainder of 2016, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we saw continued growth on the East and West coasts of the U.S. and the start of numerous large projects, and also experienced continued growth in our trench, power and pump segment. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the volume of OEC on rent increased   2.2   percent. In light of these indicators, we updated our full year 2016 forecast to reflect our expectations that 1) our rental rate and adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure as defined below, results will be in the upper range of our prior guidance and 2) net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure as defined below, will exceed our prior guidance despite modestly higher capital spending plans.  
  Financial Overview 
  During 2015 and 2016, we have taken the following actions to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity, and to position us to invest the necessary capital in our business:  
             
    Redeemed all of our 5    3   /   4    percent Senior Secured Notes, 8    3   /   8    percent Senior Subordinated Notes, 8    1   /   4    percent Senior Notes and 7    3   /   8    percent Senior Notes; 
                
    Issued $1 billion principal amount of 4    5   /   8    percent Senior Secured Notes;  
                  
    Amended and extended our ABL facility, and increased the size of the facility to   $2.5 billion  ; and 
                
    Amended and extended our accounts receivable securitization facility, and increased the size of the facility to $  625  . 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , we had available liquidity of $  1.06 billion  , including cash and cash equivalents of $  297  .  
  Net income.   Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:    

Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   include the after-tax impacts of the items below. The tax rates applied to the items below reflect the statutory rates in the applicable entity.

              (7) 
    This charge reflects write-offs of fixed assets in connection with our restructuring programs. 
     EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations.   EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net and the impact of the fair value mark-up of the acquired RSC fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an

understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity.

The EBITDA decrease primarily reflects decreased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment, and the impact of the merger credit recognized during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   associated with a decline in the fair value of the contingent cash consideration component of the National Pump purchase price due to lower than expected financial performance compared to agreed upon financial targets. The adjusted EBITDA decrease primarily reflects decreased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , EBITDA margin   decreased     210   basis points to   45.8   percent, and adjusted EBITDA margin   decreased     120   basis points to   47.4   percent. The decrease in the EBITDA margin primarily reflects decreased margins from equipment rentals and the impact of the National Pump merger credit recognized during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in the adjusted EBITDA margin primarily reflects decreased margins from equipment rentals.  

Results of Operations 
  As discussed in note   2   to our condensed consolidated financial statements, our reportable segments are general rentals and trench, power and pump. The general rentals segment includes the rental of construction, aerial, industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities. The general rentals segment s customers include construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and government entities. The general rentals segment operates throughout the United States and Canada. The trench, power and pump segment is comprised of i) the Trench Safety region, which rents trench safety equipment such as trench shields, aluminum hydraulic shoring systems, slide rails, crossing plates, construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work, ii) the Power and HVAC region, which rents power and HVAC equipment such as portable diesel generators, electrical distribution equipment, and temperature control equipment including heating and cooling equipment, and iii) the Pump Solutions region, which rents pumps primarily used by municipalities, industrial plants, and mining, construction, and agribusiness customers. The trench, power and pump segment s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects, municipalities and industrial companies. The trench, power and pump segment operates throughout the United States and in Canada. 
  As discussed in note   2   to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we aggregate our   nine   geographic regions Industrial (which serves the geographic Gulf region and has a strong industrial presence), Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Northeast, Pacific West, South-Central, South, Southeast and Western Canada into our general rentals reporting segment. Historically, there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions. For the five year period ended   September 30, 2016  ,   one   of our general rentals' regions had an equipment rentals gross margin that varied by between 10 percent and   12   percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals' regions over the same period. The rental industry is cyclical, and there historically have been regions with equipment rentals gross margins that varied by greater than 10 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals' regions, though the specific regions with margin variances of over 10 percent have fluctuated. We expect margin convergence going forward given the cyclical nature of the rental industry, and monitor the margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis. 
  We similarly monitor the margin variances for the regions in the trench, power and pump segment. The Pump Solutions region is primarily comprised of locations acquired in the April 2014 National Pump acquisition. As such, there isn t a long history of the Pump Solutions region's rental margins included in the trench, power and pump segment. When monitoring for margin convergence, we include projected future results. We monitor the trench, power and pump segment margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis.

We believe that the regions that are aggregated into our segments have similar economic characteristics, as each region is capital intensive, offers similar products to similar customers, uses similar methods to distribute its products, and is subject to similar competitive risks. The aggregation of our regions also reflects the management structure that we use for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Although we believe aggregating these regions into our reporting segments for segment reporting purposes is appropriate, to the extent that there are significant margin variances that do not converge, we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments. Any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations. 
  These segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates and allocates resources. We evaluate segment performance based on segment equipment rentals gross profit. Our revenues, operating results, and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers, with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter. 
  Revenues by segment were as follows:    

Equipment rentals  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , equipment rentals of $  1.322 billion     decreased   $  4  , or   0.3   percent, as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily reflecting a   1.7   percent rental rate decrease partially offset by a   2.2   percent increase in the volume of OEC on rent. The decreased rental rates reflected continued pressure from oil and gas and from Canada, and the impact of recent industry fleet expansion. Although we experienced rate pressures during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we also saw improving demand in many of our core markets, as evidenced by the increase in the volume of OEC on rent. Equipment rentals represented   88   percent of total revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Segment Equipment Rentals Gross Profit 
  Segment equipment rentals gross profit and gross margin were as follows: 

General rentals  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , equipment rentals gross profit   decreased   by $  31   and equipment rentals gross margin   decreased   by   180   basis points from   2015  , primarily reflecting decreased rental rates partially offset by a   30   basis point increase in time utilization. Time utilization is calculated by dividing the amount of time an asset is on rent by the amount of time the asset has been owned during the year. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , time utilization was   71.5   percent and   71.2   percent, respectively. The decreased rental rates reflected continued pressure from oil and gas and from Canada, and the impact of recent industry fleet expansion. Although we experienced rate pressures during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we also saw improving demand in many of our core markets, as evidenced by a   2.0   percent increase in the volume of OEC on rent.

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , time utilization was   67.4   percent and   67.0   percent, respectively. The decreased rental rates reflected continued pressure from oil and gas and from Canada, and the impact of recent industry fleet expansion. Although we experienced rate pressures during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we also saw improving demand in many of our core markets, as evidenced by a   2.6   percent increase in the volume of OEC on rent. Gross margin from sales of rental equipment   decreased     260   basis points primarily due to decreased pricing.  
  Other costs/(income) 
  The table below includes the other costs/(income) in our condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as key associated metrics, for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :       

SG A expense   primarily includes sales force compensation, information technology costs, third party professional fees, management salaries, bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead. 
  The   merger related costs   reflect changes subsequent to the acquisition date to the fair value of the contingent cash consideration we paid associated with the April 2014 National Pump acquisition. The income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   reflects a decline in the fair value of the contingent cash consideration component of the National Pump purchase price due to lower than expected financial performance compared to agreed upon financial targets.

     Table of Contents  

The   restructuring charges   primarily reflect severance and branch closure charges associated with a restructuring program we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015 in response to challenges in our operating environment. Though we expect solid industry growth in the foreseeable future, the restructuring program was initiated in an effort to reduce costs in an environment with continuing pressures on volume and pricing. We expect to complete the restructuring program in 2016. For additional information, see note   3   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Non-rental depreciation and amortization   includes (i) the amortization of other intangible assets and (ii) depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent (such as computers and office equipment) and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements. Our other intangible assets consist of customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trade names and associated trademarks. 
  Interest expense, net   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   includes aggregate losses of $  10   and $  36  , respectively, associated with the debt redemptions and extension of our ABL facility discussed in note   6   to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Interest expense, net for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   includes an aggregate loss of $  123   associated with redemptions of some or all of our 5    3   /   4    percent Senior Secured Notes, 8    3   /   8    percent Senior Subordinated Notes and 8    1   /   4    percent Senior Notes. Excluding the impact of the debt redemption losses, interest expense, net for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased primarily due to lower average debt and a lower average cost of debt.  
  The differences between the   2016   and   2015     effective tax rates   and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35 percent primarily relate to the geographical mix of income between foreign and domestic operations, as well as the impact of state and local taxes, and certain nondeductible charges. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes the impact of a $6 increase in valuation allowances resulting from the enactment of Connecticut state limitations on net operating loss utilization. 
  Balance sheet.   Prepaid expenses and other assets decreased by $  60  , or   51.7   percent, from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   primarily due to an income tax refund received in 2016. Accounts payable increased by $  138  , or   50.9   percent, from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   primarily due to a seasonal increase in capital expenditures. 
  Goodwill   is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. We review the goodwill of our reporting units (which are our regions) for impairment utilizing a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units' net assets to the respective carrying value of the net assets. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets is less than its fair value, no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's net assets is higher than its fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed. In the second step, the impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill (as if purchase accounting were performed on the testing date) with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations. 
  In connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of October 1, 2015, we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units, excluding our Pump Solutions reporting unit, had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 51 percent. Based on the October 1, 2015 test, the Pump Solutions reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying amount by 3 percent. In light of continuing pressures on the Pump Solutions reporting unit related primarily to upstream oil and gas customers, we continued to monitor the Pump Solutions reporting unit for impairment through the end of 2015, and performed another impairment test as of November 30, 2015.  
  As of the November 30, 2015 testing date, the estimated fair value of the Pump Solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 1 percent. Given the narrow margin by which the estimated fair value of the Pump Solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, we also performed a sensitivity analysis related to the discount rate and long-term growth rate used in the November 30, 2015 test. Specifically, we performed the sensitivity analysis by: (i) increasing the discount rate by 50 basis points and (ii) reducing the long-term growth rate by 25 basis points. The Pump Solutions reporting unit failed step one of the goodwill impairment test under the sensitivity test, and would have required step two testing to determine potential goodwill impairment. The November 30, 2015 impairment test assumed earnings growth for the Pump Solutions reporting unit over the next three years.  
  We intend to conduct our annual goodwill impairment test for all our reporting units excluding the Pump Solutions reporting unit as of October 1, 2016. Given the narrow margin by which the estimated fair value of the Pump Solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount in the November 30, 2015 test, we continued to monitor the Pump Solutions

reporting unit for impairment following the November 30, 2015 test. The growth in the Pump Solutions reporting unit was also lower than expected. As a result, we performed an interim impairment test for our Pump Solutions reporting unit as of August 31, 2016. We utilized a discount rate of 14.0 percent and a long-term terminal growth rate of 3.0 percent beyond our planning period. This goodwill impairment testing indicated that the Pump Solutions reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 19 percent. The improvement in the margin by which the Pump Solutions reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying amount in the August 31, 2016 test as compared to the November 30, 2015 test primarily reflects (i) a reduction in the Pump Solutions reporting unit s carrying value primarily due to the depreciation and amortization of its assets, as well as a reduction in its working capital and (ii) improvement in the Pump Solutions reporting unit s revenue mix in its long term forecast largely due to having a smaller portion of revenue attributable to upstream oil and gas customers, which have experienced significant volatility in recent years, and a larger portion of revenue attributable to downstream oil and gas, construction, municipality and mining customers. We also performed a sensitivity analysis related to the discount rate and long-term growth rate used in the August 31, 2016 test by: (i) increasing the discount rate by 50 basis points and (ii) reducing the long-term growth rate by 25 basis points. The Pump Solutions reporting unit passed step one of the goodwill impairment test under the sensitivity test. The August 31, 2016 impairment test assumed earnings growth for the Pump Solutions reporting unit over the next 10 years. Should this growth not occur, if the reporting unit otherwise fails to meet its current financial plans, or if there were changes to any other key assumption used in the test, the Pump Solutions reporting unit could fail step one of the goodwill impairment test in a future period. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was $  313   of goodwill in the Pump Solutions reporting unit. We will continue to monitor the Pump Solutions reporting unit for impairment. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices, which are subject to (i) the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services, (ii) the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and (iii) the statutes, regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate. See "Financial Overview" above for a summary of recent capital structure actions taken to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity.  
  Since 2012, we have repurchased a total of $1.450 billion of Holdings' common stock under three completed share repurchase programs. Additionally, in July 2015, our Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program which commenced in November 2015. We intend to complete the $1 billion program within 18 months of its initiation in November 2015. As of   October 17, 2016  , we have repurchased $624 of Holdings' common stock under the $1 billion share repurchase program. 
  Our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment, and borrowings available under our ABL facility and accounts receivable securitization facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of $  297  . Cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated A or better. We believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months. The table below presents financial information associated with our principal sources of cash as of and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :

(1)    The maximum month-end debt outstanding under the ABL facility exceeded the average month-end debt outstanding primarily due to the use of borrowings under the ABL facility to partially finance the debt redemptions discussed in note   6   to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  We expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our operations over the next 12 months will be to fund (i) operating activities and working capital, (ii) the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale, (iii) payments due under operating leases, (iv) debt service and (v) share repurchases. We plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash. In addition, we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate, the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit. 
  To access the capital markets, we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets. Credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions, including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions. As a result, negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding. Our credit ratings as of   October 17, 2016   were as follows:    
                       
    Corporate Rating 
      
    Outlook 
      Moody s 
    Ba3 
      
    Stable 
      Standard   Poor s 
    BB- 
      
    Stable 

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. There is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future. 
  Loan Covenants and Compliance.   As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the ABL facility, the accounts receivable securitization facility and the senior notes. Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations. 
  The only financial covenant that currently exists under the ABL facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio. Subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the ABL facility, the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the ABL facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the ABL facility falls below   10 percent   of the maximum revolver amount under the ABL facility. When certain conditions are met, cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the ABL facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the ABL facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , specified availability under the ABL facility exceeded the required threshold and, as a result, this maintenance covenant was inapplicable. Under our accounts receivable securitization facility, we are required, among other things, to maintain certain financial tests relating to: (i) the default ratio, (ii) the delinquency ratio, (iii) the dilution ratio and (iv) days sales outstanding. The accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the ABL facility, to the extent the ratio is applicable under the ABL facility. 
  URNA s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in the ABL facility and the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness. Although this restricted capacity limits our ability to move operating cash flows to Holdings, because of certain intercompany arrangements, we do not expect any material adverse impact on Holdings  ability to meet its cash obligations.  
  Sources and Uses of Cash.   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we (i) generated cash from operating activities of $  1.630 billion   and (ii) generated cash from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of $  373  . We used cash during this period principally to (i) purchase rental and non-rental equipment of $  1.210 billion  , (ii) make debt payments, net of proceeds, of   $209   and (iii) purchase shares of our common stock for   $488  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we (i) generated cash from operating activities of $  1.557 billion  , (ii) generated cash from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of $  395   and (iii) received cash from debt proceeds, net of payments, of $  360  . We used cash during this period principally to (i) purchase rental and non-rental equipment of $  1.501 billion  , (ii) purchase other companies for $  86  , (iii) pay $  52   of contingent consideration associated with the April 2014 National Pump acquisition and (iv) purchase shares of our common stock for $  667  . 
  Free Cash Flow GAAP Reconciliation.   We define  free cash flow  as (i) net cash provided by operating activities less (ii) purchases of rental and non-rental equipment plus (iii) proceeds from sales of rental and non-rental equipment and excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements. However, free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. Accordingly, free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. The table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow.     
  
   39 

     Table of Contents  

Free cash flow for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was $  846  , an increase of $  338   as compared to $  508   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Free cash flow increased primarily due to decreased purchases of rental equipment and increased net cash provided by operating activities. The excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements result from stock-based compensation windfall deductions in excess of the amounts reported for financial reporting purposes. Such benefits are recognized as a credit to additional paid-in capital, and are reported as financing cash flows. We added the excess tax benefits back to our calculation of free cash flow to generally classify cash flows from income taxes as operating cash flows. However, these excess tax benefits did not impact free cash flow for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  , as they do not result in increased cash flows until the associated income taxes are settled.  
  Certain Information Concerning Contractual Obligations  . The table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016  :  

_________________ 
           (1) 
    The payments due with respect to a period represent (i) in the case of debt and capital leases, the scheduled principal payments due in such period, and (ii) in the case of operating leases, the minimum lease payments due in such period under non-cancelable operating leases.  
              (2) 
    Estimated interest payments have been calculated based on the principal amount of debt and the applicable interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  .  
              (3) 
    These primarily represent service agreements with third parties to provide wireless and network services.  
              (4) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding purchase orders, which were negotiated in the ordinary course of business, with our equipment and inventory suppliers. These purchase commitments can generally be cancelled by us with 30 days notice and without cancellation penalties. The equipment and inventory receipts from the suppliers for these purchases and related payments to the suppliers are expected to be completed throughout 2016 and 2017. 
              (5) 
    This information excludes $2 of unrecognized tax benefits. It is not possible to estimate the time period during which these unrecognized tax benefits may be paid to tax authorities.  
     Relationship between Holdings and URNA.   Holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary, URNA, and subsidiaries of URNA. Holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to URNA in connection with its operations. These services principally include: (i) senior management services; (ii) finance and tax-related services and support; (iii) information technology systems and support; (iv) acquisition-related services; (v) legal services; and (vi) human resource support. In addition, Holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by URNA and its subsidiaries.  
  Holdings receives royalties from URNA and its subsidiaries based upon a percent of revenue. These royalties result in intercompany receivables for Holdings. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the royalty percent of revenue (the  
  
   40 

     Table of Contents  

"royalty rate") increased from two and a half percent to eight percent. The increased royalty rate was applied retroactively to January 1, 2015 resulting in Holdings receiving increased royalties from URNA during the three months ended September 30, 2015 (see note   9   to our condensed consolidated financial statements). The royalty rate increased as a result of a reassessment of the benefit provided by Holdings' trademark and its business support to URNA and its subsidiaries. As of   September 30, 2016  , our total available capacity for making share repurchases and dividend payments, which includes URNA s capacity to make restricted payments and the intercompany receivable balance of Holdings, was   $561  .

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
     Our exposure to market risk primarily consists of (i) interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt and (ii) foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our Canadian operations. 
  Interest Rate Risk.   As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an aggregate of $  2.3 billion   of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, comprised of borrowings under the ABL facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility. The amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the ABL facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" above for the amounts outstanding, and the interest rates thereon, as of   September 30, 2016   under the ABL facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding, our annual after-tax earnings would decrease by approximately $  14   for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had an aggregate of $  5.7   billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates. A one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of   September 30, 2016   would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately   six percent  . For additional information concerning the fair value of our fixed rate debt, see note   5   (see  Fair Value of Financial Instruments ) to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Currency Exchange Risk  . The functional currency for our Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar. As a result, our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars. Based upon the level of our Canadian operations during   2015   relative to the Company as a whole, a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would cause our annual after-tax earnings to change by approximately $8. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the average Canadian exchange rate deteriorated by approximately   5   percent year-over-year. We do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes.

 RULE 13A-14(A) CERTIFICATION BY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

Exhibit 

Exhibit 31(a)  
  CERTIFICATIONS  
  I, Michael J. Kneeland, certify that:  
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of United Rentals, Inc. and United Rentals (North America), Inc. for the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016  ; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrants as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrants' other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrants and have: 
              a) 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrants, including their consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrants' disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and. 
              d)
