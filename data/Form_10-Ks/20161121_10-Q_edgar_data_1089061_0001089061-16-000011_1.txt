NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

Organization
  FINDEX.cOM, Inc.   

Findex.com, Inc. s headquarters and operations are based in
Lake Park, Florida. The Company is a developer, manufacturer, and marketer of a proprietary line of specialty industrial glass-based
smart surface coatings materials that have a broad range of industrial, commercial, and consumer applications. The Company s
line of products center around a U.S. patented technology that, either on its own or when coupled with any of an array of available
proprietary formula additives, offers a unique combination of beneficial surface properties that allow for a broad array of multi-surface
and end-product applications. Among others, such applications include: 

Heavy machinery, equipment and infrastructure throughout each of the construction, oil and gas, and mining industries   

Marine industry, vessels and infrastructure   

Industrial HVAC equipment, commercial refrigeration systems, and power generators   

Energy production equipment, including solar and wind   

Hardscapes   

On September 14, 2016, the Company became the holder of what
is currently an approximately 25% minority equity stake in a recently formed, closely-held, private limited liability
company, Advanced Nanofibers LLC ( Advanced ). Advanced is comprised of three entity members, including the
Company, Nanotech Fibers LLC, and EnVont, LLC. The Company s president and chief executive officer currently holds a
18.75% equity interest in Nanotech Fibers LLC through a closely held private Florida limited liability company, August Center
Street Holdings LLC. August Center Street Holdings is owned 75% by the Company s president and chief executive officer
and 25% by the Company s general counsel. Advanced is a Florida based nanotechnology firm focused on fundamentally
broadening the industrial utilization of nanofibers and nanoparticles globally throughout a diverse range of mass-market
applications. It s platform technological contributions and sustainable solutions center around (i) meaningfully
proprietary, and expected-to-be revolutionary, industrially disruptive advances in the custom molecular bonding of nanofibers
to application-specific nanoparticles such that the result in each case is an unparalleled, multifunctional
 super -composite exhibiting new and meaningfully superior physical, flexural, chemical and structural
properties, (ii) ultra-cost-efficient production capabilities at scale, and (iii) the application of internally-developed
breakthrough environmental safety advances throughout the handling and production process of its potentially hazardous
materials. Its nanoparticle bonded nanofibers mark a new age in polymeric-based advanced composites. Based on their
fundamental composition, Advanced is able to produce these materials in a virtually limitless array of
industrial application-specific varieties, to be used either alone or in conjunction with other fibers and materials, making
nanoparticle bonded nanofibers an ideal host for a variety of advanced composites. 

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION   

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for interim financial information and with the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for complete financial statements. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements reflect all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for such periods
are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year or for any future period. The December 31, 2015 condensed
consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements. The accompanying financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of Findex.com, Inc. included in the Company s Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016. 

Table of Contents      

Principles
of Consolidation   

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Reclassifications   

Certain accounts in the Company s 2015 financial statements
have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform with the presentation in  2016 financial statements. 

Use
of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors
that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual
results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there
are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Significant
estimates include inventory evaluation for slow moving and obsolete items, collectability of accounts receivable, assessing intangibles
for impairment, useful lives of assets, and valuation of stock based compensation. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

INVENTORY  

The Company s inventories are recorded at the lower of cost
or market using the first in, first out method. The Company s inventory consists of raw materials and finished goods. The
Company takes into consideration certain inventory items that are slow moving and obsolete and calculates a provision for these
inventory items. 

INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL  

The Company s intangible assets consist of patents and patents
pending acquired from third parties, and are recorded at cost. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) 350-30,  General Intangibles Other Than Goodwill , intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life are not amortized. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives, generally three to ten years. All intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter. 

REVENUE
RECOGNITION   

The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the Securities
and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) number 104,  Revenue Recognition.  SAB 104 clarifies application of
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to revenue transactions. Under certain circumstances, the Company recognizes revenue
in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 139 and American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position 00-2 (collectively referred to as  SOP 00-2 ). The Company recognizes revenue when
the earnings process is complete. That is, when the arrangements of the goods are documented, the pricing becomes final and collectability
is reasonably assured. An allowance for bad debt is provided based on estimated losses. 

Revenue is recognized when a product is delivered or shipped to
the customer and all material conditions relating to the sale have been substantially performed. 

Table of Contents      

In addition, within the Company s operations as a whole, the
Company derives part of its revenues from the sale of downloadable software products. The Company recognizes software revenue for
software products and related services in accordance with ASC 985-605,  Software Revenue Recognition . The Company recognizes
revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists (generally a purchase order), the Company has delivered the product,
the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. In some situations, the Company receives advance payments from
the Company s customers. The Company defers revenue associated with these advance payments until the Company ships the products
or offers the support. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  

The Company s research
and development costs consist of direct production costs, including labor directly associated with the development of projects
and outside consultants, and indirect costs such as those associated with facilities use. For labor costs and costs of outside
consultants, the Company records the research and development costs as a reduction against either personnel costs or professional
fees. For facilities leasing related expenses, the Company records the research and development costs as a reduction against rent.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $149,358 and $205,555, respectively, in research
and development costs.  

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  

The Company recognizes share-based compensation in accordance with
ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , using the modified prospective method. ASC 718 requires that the Company
measure the cost of the employee services received in exchange for an award for equity instruments based on the grant-date fair
value and to recognize this cost over the requisite service period. See Note 11. 

EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE  

The Company follows the guidance of ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share ,
to calculate and report basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ). Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed
by giving effect to all dilutive potential shares of common stock that were outstanding during the period. For the Company, dilutive
potential shares of common stock consist of the incremental shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options
and warrants for all periods, convertible notes payable and the incremental shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion
of convertible preferred stock. 

When discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and/or the cumulative
effect of an accounting change are present, income before any of such items on a per share basis represents the  control
number  in determining whether potential shares of common stock are dilutive or anti-dilutive. Thus, the same number of potential
shares of common stock used in computing diluted EPS for income from continuing operations is used in calculating all other reported
diluted EPS amounts. In the case of a net loss, it is assumed that no incremental shares would be issued because they would be
anti-dilutive. In addition, certain options and warrants are considered anti-dilutive because the exercise prices were above the
average market price during the period. Anti-dilutive shares are not included in the computation of diluted EPS, in accordance
with ASC 260-10-45-17. 

The calculations of net loss per share for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 excluded the impact of the following potential common shares as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

DISCONTINUED
OPERATIONS   

On May 5, 2011, Findex entered into a Software Product Line Purchase
Agreement with WORDsearch Corp., L.L.C. In accordance with the Software Product Line Purchase Agreement, WORDsearch agreed to acquire
from Findex all of the assets associated with the QuickVerse    product line which centered around Findex s
industry-leading Bible-study software program. The specific assets conveyed include, among others, the underlying software source
code, registered trade names, and existing product inventories. As a result, the Company has classified any associated liabilities
as well as all expenses directly related to the QuickVerse    product line as discontinued operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. See Note 14. 

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

At September 30, 2016, there were no recent accounting pronouncements
that the Company believed would have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN  

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplates the
Company s continuation as a going concern. However, as of September 30, 2016, the Company had negative working capital of
$2,750,885 and had an accumulated deficit of $6,178,134. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. Management has taken several actions in an attempt to mitigate this risk. These actions include
capital raising initiatives involving the issuance of equity and/or notes payable to investors, as well as cash
conservation initiatives involving the issuance of equity and/or notes payable to employees and related parties. The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to these uncertainties. 

NOTE 3   INVENTORIES  

Inventories consisted of the following: 

NOTE 4   INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTEE  

On September 14, 2016, the Company entered into a certain operating
agreement pursuant to which we became the holder of (what currently constitutes) a roughly 25% equity (membership) interest in
a newly formed, closely held private Florida limited liability company joint venture, Advanced Nanofibers LLC ( Advanced ).
The membership interest in Advanced was acquired in exchange for a capital contribution in cash by us to Advanced in the amount
of $1,000 (together with certain going-forward non-cash contributions). Advanced was otherwise capitalized with contributions in
cash totaling $3,000 by two other parties to the operating agreement, Nanotech Fibers LLC and EnVont, LLC, both Florida limited
liability companies. Advanced is comprised of three entity members, including the Company, Nanotech Fibers LLC, and EnVont, LLC.
The Company s president and chief executive officer currently holds a 18.75% equity interest in Nanotech Fibers LLC through
a closely held private Florida limited liability company, August Center Street Holdings LLC. August Center Street Holdings is owned
75% by the Company s president and chief executive officer and 25% by the Company s general counsel. As of September
30, 2016, there was no other material transactional activity associated with this joint venture. 

NOTE 5   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  

Property and equipment consisted of the following: 

Table of Contents      

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
recorded depreciation expense of $13,446 and $13,095, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company invested
$10,334 in building out a new research lab within our corporate headquarters located in the Lake Park, Florida. The new research
lab will replace the research lab located in Daytona Beach, Florida which was relocated in July 2016. See Note 12. 

NOTE 6   INTANGIBLE ASSETS  

The Company s intangible assets consist of patents and patents
pending acquired from third parties, and are recorded at cost. The Company amortizes the costs of its intangible assets over their
estimated useful lives unless such lives of approximately 11 years. Patents pending are not amortized until the patents are issued.
Amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to fair
value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment,
at least annually, and written down to fair value as required. 

The Company s intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization
consisted of the following: 

The Surface Modification Technologies assets include a patent, a
patent pending, trade secret technology, instructions, manuals and materials on certain manufacturing processes and know-how. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded amortization expense of $35,634 and $35,635, respectively. 

NOTE 7   GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized
$1,433,465 of goodwill impairment expense related to the Findex legacy software segment which is no longer being actively pursued.
The Company tests goodwill for impairment as required by ASC 350,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . Goodwill is not
amortized, but instead tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently upon occurrence
of certain events. 

NOTE 8   NOTES PAYABLE AND NOTES PAYABLE
- RELATED PARTIES  

Notes payable consisted of the following: 

Table of Contents      

Notes payable to non-related parties consisted
of the following: 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding a past due
note payable (b) to a shareholder in the amount of $300,000. A previously outstanding note payable to the same party, that had
contained a conversion feature in the amount of $250,000, pre-dated this note. However, in March 2015, the Company entered into
a loan modification agreement which provided that the original note, along with the attendant conversion feature, be cancelled,
and that a replacement note to be issued in its stead at an upwardly adjusted principal amount of $300,000, but without any associated
conversion feature. In accordance with ASC 470-50-40, the Company deemed the transaction for accounting purposes to be a debt extinguishment
due to the substantially different terms, and, as a result, recorded a gain on debt settlement of $200,000. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, t he Company recognized a debt discount of $9,900 associated with two notes
payable as they each carried a beneficial conversion feature. This debt discount has been fully amortized to interest expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. See Note 10.  

At September 30, 2016, the Company was in arrears on the unsecured
term note payable (a) to a former shareholder, the unsecured term note payable (b) to a current shareholder, the convertible term
note payable (d) to another current shareholder and the convertible note payable (f) to a third current shareholder. On April 12,
2016, the Company repaid and retired a $10,000 note to a private investor together with $1,000 in then-accrued interest ($11,000
total). On September 9, 2016, a private investor of a convertible note payable (e) opted to convert the note payable plus accrued
interest totaling $10,456 into 2,613,963 shares of common stock. The Company repriced the original conversion of $0.02 per share
to $0.004 per share which resulted in a loss on conversion in the amount of $13,593. See Note 9.

NOTE 9   LOSS ON CONVERSION OF NOTE PAYABLE  

On September 9, 2016, an investor holding a convertible
note elected to convert such note, together with all then-accrued interest, totaling $10,456 into 2,613,963 shares of common stock.

NOTE 10   GAIN ON DEBT SETTLEMENT  

In March 2015, the Company recognized a gain on debt settlement
in the amount of $200,000. This gain is a result of entering into a loan modification agreement with a shareholder that had held
an outstanding convertible note agreement in the amount of $250,000 carrying a conversion feature that had the accounting effect
of increasing the derivative liability associated with the obligation from $250,000 to $500,000. The loan modification called for
the original convertible note payable ($250,000), along with the conversion feature ($250,000), dated July 2014 to be 

 cancelled. In addition, the loan modification called for a replacement
note payable to be entered into at the adjusted principal amount of $300,000, total, but without any conversion feature exercisable
on the part of the holder. All other terms of the original note agreement remained unchanged. As a result, the Company recognized
a net gain of $200,000, and has treated it as a gain from extinguishment of debt and included it in Gain on debt settlement on
our condensed consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. See Note 8.

In September, 2016, a holder of a convertible
note issued by the Company elected to convert such note, together with all then-accrued interest, totaling $10,456 into 2,613,963
shares of common stock. In connection with such election, the Company repriced the original conversion of $0.02 per share to $0.004
per share which resulted in an accounting loss upon such conversion in the amount of $13,593. See Notes 8 and 9. 

In September, 2016, the Company entered into an independent
contractor agreement with an individual to provide business development related services. The agreement calls for the
independent contractor to be paid at an hourly rate of $100, half of which is payable in cash and half of which is payable in
restricted shares of Company common stock, such shares to be valued at the closing price of the Company common stock on the

certain Company common stock subscriptions. Each such warrant enabled the holder to purchase up to an additional 100,000 (4,150,000
in total) shares of common stock (beyond their otherwise subscribed-for shares) for a period of up to one year at an exercise price
of $0.10 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, none of such warrants were exercised. Thirteen warrants,

to be found liable for otherwise incur as a result of these actions is not so much as would materially affect the Company s
financial condition.

free cash flow (as calculated pursuant to a stated formula) up to a maximum of $500,000 for any single fiscal year. As of September
30, 2016, and 2015 no amounts for bonuses had been earned or accrued under this provision. In addition to the bonus provision and

and vested deferred vacation compensation in the amount of $12,501 as of September 30, 2016 and are included in accrued payroll.

agreement with  our vice president of research and development. Among
other terms and provisions, the employment agreement provides specific executive-level responsibilities for a term of 3
years, unless otherwise extended or terminated by either party, either for cause, without cause, due to disability or death,
or voluntarily. During the term of the employment agreement, and in addition to certain benefits, expense coverage and
severance compensation, our vice president of research and development is entitled to a base annual salary of not less than
$120,000, as well as a royalty of 5% of the gross  revenue, net of returns, for all revenues generated by products
relying on the intellectual property assigned to the Company. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company has made payments to a company owned by our Vice President of Research and Development under these arrangements. As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has accrued approximately $9,420 in accrued royalties under this agreement. See Notes 8

On September 14, 2016, the Company became the holder of what
is currently an approximately 25% minority equity stake in a recently formed, closely-held, private limited liability
company, Advanced Nanofibers LLC ( Advanced ). Advanced is comprised of three entity members, including the
Company, Nanotech Fibers LLC, and EnVont, LLC. The Company s president and chief executive officer currently holds a
18.75% equity interest in Nanotech Fibers LLC through a closely held private Florida limited liability company, August Center
Street Holdings LLC. August Center Street Holdings is owned 75% by the Company s president and chief executive officer
and 25% by the Company s general counsel. Advanced is a Florida based nanotechnology firm focused on fundamentally
broadening the industrial utilization of nanofibers and nanoparticles globally throughout a diverse range of mass-market
applications. It s platform technological contributions and sustainable solutions center around (i) meaningfully
proprietary, and expected-to-be revolutionary, industrially disruptive advances in the custom molecular bonding of nanofibers
to application-specific nanoparticles such that the result in each case is an unparalleled, multifunctional
 super -composite exhibiting new and meaningfully superior physical, flexural, chemical and structural
properties, (ii) ultra-cost-efficient production capabilities at scale, and (iii) the application of
internally-developed breakthrough environmental safety advances throughout the handling and production process of its
potentially hazardous materials. Its nanoparticle bonded nanofibers mark a new age in polymeric-based advanced composites.
Based on their fundamental composition, Advanced is able to produce these materials in a virtually limitless array of
industrial application-specific varieties, to be used either alone or in conjunction with other fibers and materials, making
nanoparticle bonded nanofibers an ideal host for a variety of advanced composites. With the Company president and chief
executive officer, Steven Malone, serving as a managing director of Advanced concurrently with his position within the
Company, management is increasingly devoting its time, and increasingly allocating the Company s human and financial
resources, to the planning and operations of Advanced.

Management Overview  

A key focus of management during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 centered on increasing sales with our current resellers and distributors but also through the addition of resellers and
distributors in specific vertical markets such as heavy equipment, industrial HVAC equipment, interior floor coatings and exterior
hardscape coatings. In addition, management continued exploring and building relationships with potentially key strategic business
partners, investors, and potential additional distributors and/or resellers of our products. Each of the strategic sell-side relationships
were pointedly pursued in order to establish, further develop, and/or expand our existing customer base within certain of our most
aggressively targeted verticals. For this period, and for the indefinite future, management is committed to securing and solidifying
foundational relationships within each of its heavy equipment, interior/hardscape, solar, oil, gas and mining, HVAC, and marine
markets, and intends to allocate its financial and human resources accordingly. 

During the period ended September 30, 2016, management remained
focused on three primary areas identified as keys to the near-term viability, growth and prosperity of EcoSmart. One area is revenue
generation, as effected through the formalization of various distribution and licensing relationships that the Company has been
pursuing over time. A second area is the maximization of cash flow and return on existing assets, as effected through the refinement
of internal production operations and throughput efficiencies. The third other area is corporate finance, and specifically the
raising of capital necessary to bridge shortfalls in available cash, for both operational and capital investment purposes, through
to the point, if at all, at which working capital and cash reserve levels are sufficient to be self-sustaining. 

In addition, management consolidated our facilities by relocating
our research and development lab in Daytona Beach, Florida to our recently built-out research lab in our Lake Park, Florida facility
that separately occupies our corporate offices. The relocation is intended and expected to not only reduce overhead and travel
expenses but also to facilitate enhanced collaboration between research and development, on the one hand, and production operations,
on the other, in connection with a variety of existing markets we are pursuing as well as a variety of potentially new markets
we are currently exploring. 

In August 2016, management also entered into a manufacturing and
distribution joint venture agreement  that affords us the opportunity to commercially exploit a certain
proprietary, rubber-glass fusion coating technology/material through a combination of product manufacturing and global/worldwide
distribution, marketing, and sales. Management believes this technology and the associated product lines strategically align with
the markets into which we have already begun to establish relationship inroads in terms of distributors and resellers.   

On September 14, 2016, and for a nominal cash investment of
$1,000, the Company became the holder of what is currently an approximately 25% minority equity stake in a recently formed,
closely-held, private limited liability company, Advanced Nanofibers LLC ( Advanced ). Advanced is a Florida
based nanotechnology firm focused on fundamentally broadening the industrial utilization of nanofibers and nanoparticles
globally throughout a diverse range of mass-market applications. It s platform technological contributions and
sustainable solutions center around (i) meaningfully proprietary, and expected-to-be revolutionary, industrially disruptive
advances in the custom molecular bonding of nanofibers to application-specific nanoparticles such that the result in each
case is an unparalleled, multifunctional  super -composite exhibiting new and meaningfully superior physical,
flexural, chemical and structural properties, (ii) ultra-cost-efficient production capabilities at scale, and (iii) the
application of internally-developed breakthrough environmental safety advances throughout the handling and production process
of its potentially hazardous materials. Its nanoparticle bonded nanofibers mark a new age in polymeric-based advanced
composites. Based on their fundamental composition, Advanced is able to produce these materials in a virtually limitless
array of industrial application-specific varieties, to be used either alone or in conjunction with other fibers and
materials, making nanoparticle bonded nanofibers an ideal host for a variety of advanced composites. With the
Company president and chief executive officer, Steven Malone, serving as a managing director of Advanced concurrently with
his position within the Company, management is increasingly devoting its time, and increasingly allocating the
Company s human and financial resources, to the planning and operations of Advanced.

Since the acquisition of its interest in Advanced, an aggressive push has been underway towards the commencement
of Advanced s principal production operations, both in EcoSmart s Lake Park, FL manufacturing facility, and in Greenville,
SC, at a plant operated by Hitachi s High Technologies Group. Through a developing, multi-party relationship with Hitachi,
Advanced will be producing, and, independently, globally marketing, a broad array of enhanced, manufacture-ready, proprietary and
customized industrial materials based on a blend of nanofibers and microfibers infused with application-specific nanoparticles.
The inclusion within finished goods of these types of materials is expected by Company management to fundamentally reshape a variety
of core, global industrial segments over time, including cement, plastics, textiles, filtration and insulation. Concurrent with
its readying of production operations, and with a near-term focus on the U.S. domestic cement industry, Advanced has also recently
begun aggressively pursuing sales opportunities in this multi-billion dollar vertical. 

At this time, near-term liquidity poses a continuous challenge to
us and is expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Moreover, the need to find ways to stretch our very limited
economic resources places ongoing strains on our very limited human resources, particularly as sales, and the resulting need for
skilled product applications personnel locally throughout various parts of the U.S., are trending upwards. 

Results of Operations for Quarters Ending
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015   

Table of Contents      

The differing results of operations are primarily attributable to
the following for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

an increase in net revenues resulting from increasing sales of our products in each of our heavy construction, hardscape applications and commercial HVAC verticals;   

a decrease in our other general and administrative costs resulting from a deliberate campaign of broad-ranging cutbacks in expenses;   

a decrease in research and development related expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 during which we issued stock as compensation to three consultants for their advisory services in connection with our research and development, and certain business development, initiatives;    

an increase in interest expense due to the increase in medium-term notes issued as part of our capital-raising initiatives during the nine months ended September 30, 2016;   

an increase in loss upon conversion of a note during the nine months ended September, 30 2016 attributable to our having agreed with the holder to re-price downward the conversion feature the note had carried up until the date of conversion as an incentive to the holder to compel such conversion; and   

a decrease in gain on debt settlement for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 during which we realized an accounting gain in connection with a settlement agreement entered into with a current note holder.   

Although there can be no assurance, in future periods, we anticipate
our operations to expand, potentially at a much more rapid rate, due to our anticipated growth and expansion in certain vertical
markets, including those associated with our minority interest in Advanced. 

Revenues    

Our net revenues increased approximately $110,000 from approximately
$159,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately $269,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In
line with that achievement, our net revenues increased approximately $16,000 from approximately $77,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015 to approximately $93,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in net revenues is mainly
attributable to increasing sales of our products in each of our heavy construction, hardscape application and commercial HVAC verticals. 

Cost of Sales    

Cost of sales consists primarily of direct costs, royalties accrued
to third party providers of intellectual property, and the costs associated with reproducing, packaging, and shipping our products.
As a percentage of net revenues, our cost of sales decreased 2% from 33% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 31% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The overall decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 is attributable to the following: 

Table of Contents      

an increase in the percentage of direct costs due to our having had to rely from time to time on multiple raw materials suppliers at what were relatively high delivered prices in order to meet increasing customer demand for what would have otherwise been available to us from single-source suppliers at bulk-rate product and associated freight discounts;   

an increase in the percentage of direct costs resulting from our having ordered more raw materials in advance from our suppliers in anticipation of their projected limited availability in the near-term of such materials;   

an overall decrease in the percentage of accrued royalty obligations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to a corresponding decrease in sales of products carrying a relatively high royalty obligation; and   

an increase in freight costs in real dollar terms resulting from an increase in both purchases of raw materials, on the one hand, and sales, on the other.   

Conversely, we saw an increase of 8% in our cost of sales as a percentage
of net revenues from 28% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 36% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The
overall increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2016 is attributable to
the following: 

an increase in the percentage of direct costs due to our having had to rely from time to time on multiple raw materials suppliers at what were relatively high delivered prices in order to meet increasing customer demand for what would have otherwise been available to us from single-source suppliers at bulk-rate product and associated freight discounts;   

an increase in the percentage of direct costs resulting from our having purchased more raw materials in advance from our suppliers due to their projected limited availability of such materials in the near future;   

an increase in direct costs as we wrote off some raw materials that we determined to be obsolete due to age;   

an overall decrease in the percentage of accrued royalty obligations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to a corresponding decrease in sales of products carrying a relatively high royalty obligation; and   

an increase in freight costs resulting from an increase in purchases of raw materials.   

Into the immediate future, we anticipate that our direct costs are
likely to increase in real dollar terms based on escalating sales volume coupled with the likelihood of an inability to make material
purchases in bulk at meaningfully discounted rates. Though there can be no assurance that our cash position and financial condition
will improve over time, if it does, we intend to take advantage of bulk purchasing opportunities at discounted rates. More generally,
we anticipate that our cost of sales will increase in the future in direct proportion to increases in top line growth.

Sales, General and Administrative

Our research
and development costs consist of direct production costs, including labor directly associated with the development of projects
and outside consultants, and indirect costs, such as those associated with facilities leasing and related overhead. For labor costs
and costs of outside consultants, we record the research and development costs as a reduction against either personnel costs or
contract services. For facilities leasing related expenses, we record the research and development costs as a reduction against
rent.   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reclassified to research
and development approximately $43,000 and $123,000, respectively from total personnel costs and approximately $3,000 and $21,000,
respectively from rent. Comparatively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we reclassified to research and
development approximately $38,000 and $170,000, respectively from total personnel costs and approximately $8,000 and $24,000, respectively
from rent.  

The differing results of total sales, marketing, general and administrative
costs are primarily attributable to the following for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

an overall increase in advertising and direct marketing resulting from an increase in our direct marketing efforts, our having attended and sponsored a booth at an industry trade show for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and an increase in sales commissions in direct correlation to the increase in sales;   

a decrease in personnel costs as we streamlined our office administrative personnel;   

a decrease in research and development for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as we relocated our research and development lab in Daytona Beach, Florida to our corporate office located in Lake Park, Florida which resulted in a decrease in related rent expenses as well as an overall decrease compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 during which we issued stock as compensation to three consultants for their advisory services in connection with our research and development, and certain business development, initiatives;   

a decrease in business development services;   

an overall decrease in travel and entertainment expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 during which we were represented at the 2015 International Coatings Show in Germany; and   

an increase in director s fees as we increased the fee earned by our outside director serving on the audit committee.   

For the immediate future, and although there
can be no assurance, we would anticipate our sales, marketing, general and administrative costs to increase in the future in direct
proportion to top line growth.

Loss on Conversion of Note Payable   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an investor
holding a convertible note elected to convert such note, together with all then-accrued interest, totaling $10,456
into 2,613,963 shares of common stock. In connection with such election, we repriced the original conversion of $0.02 per
share to $0.004 per share, which resulted in an accounting loss upon such conversion. As a result, we recognized a net loss
of $13,593, and we have included it in the  Loss on conversion of note payable  line item on our Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 

Gain on Debt Settlement   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized a gain
on debt settlement in the amount of $200,000. This gain is a result of entering into a loan modification agreement with a shareholder
that had held an outstanding convertible note agreement in the amount of $250,000 which, until modified, carried a conversion feature
that had the accounting effect of increasing the derivative liability associated with the obligation from $250,000 to $500,000.
The loan modification called for the original convertible note payable ($250,000), along with the conversion feature ($250,000),
dated July 2014 to be cancelled. In addition, the loan modification called for a replacement note payable to be issued by us in
the adjusted, aggregate principal amount of $300,000, but without any conversion feature. All other terms of the original note
agreement carried over to the replacement note unchanged. As a result, we recognized a net gain of $200,000, and we have treated
it as a gain from extinguishment of debt and included it in the  Gain on debt settlement  line item on our Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Income Taxes   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, based on
uncertainty about the timing of and ability to generate future taxable income and our assessment that the realization of the deferred
tax assets no longer met the  more likely than not  criterion for realization, we provided for a full valuation allowance
against our net deferred tax assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our deferred
tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the period when such
determination is made. 

Liquidity And Capital Resources   

Our primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are the working
capital requirements of our continued operations, which includes raw materials procurement, production personnel, service applications
personnel, the ongoing internal development of new products and expansion and upgrade of existing products, marketing and sales,
and executive salaries and insurance benefit obligations. Cash generated through our current operations may not prove sufficient
to sustain such operations, and our pursuit of an aggressive growth plan, as currently exists, will likely require funding from
outside sources. Funding from outside sources may include but is not limited to the pursuit of other financing options such as
commercial loans or public or private sales of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and/or convertible notes or
debentures. The Company s cash on hand as of September 30, 2016 is not sufficient to support our operations for the next
twelve months. 

Table of Contents      

Liquidity for our day-to-day continuing operations remains a very
serious ongoing concern for us, and there can be 

 no continuing assurance of it remaining manageable. 

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted mainly of payments going out for personnel, inventory purchases, vendor payments and other
operating expenses. 

Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended
June 30, 2016 was for the build-out of our new research lab within our corporate headquarters located in the Lake Park, Florida.
This new research lab will replace the research lab located in Daytona Beach, Florida which was relocated in July 2016. In addition,
we entered into an operating agreement on September 14, 2016 pursuant to which we became one of three members in a newly formed
joint venture entity that required a cash investment of $1,000. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash provided by financing
activities was mainly the result of proceeds from the issuances of convertible debt with related parties as well as a sale of shares
of our common stock. Comparatively, cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was the exclusive
result of proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock. 

Financing   

Given practical considerations, we believe that our ability to meaningfully
pursue our business plan in the immediate term will depend on the availability of working capital, the precise amount of which
is uncertain as the date of this quarterly filing on Form 10-Q given certain variables surrounding our ability to generate funds
internally, including through both sales of product and/or territorial distributorships. To the extent that it becomes necessary
to access funds through a public or private sales of securities, as we have been doing and expect to continue to have to do for
the foreseeable future, this is likely to be pursued through one or more offerings involving common stock, preferred stock and/or
convertible notes or debentures. In connection with any such financings, it may become necessary given market conditions and the
unavailability of alternative options for us to issue additional shares of our common stock or securities exchangeable for shares
of our common stock, including but not limited to convertible preferred stock or convertible notes or debentures containing so-called
 floorless convertible  provisions that can be, and often are, extremely dilutive to existing stockholders upon conversion.
Any such issuances, as well as any related issuances of common stock or other purchase warrants, would likely have the effect of
depressing the market price of our common stock and diluting the interests of our common stockholders, potentially very significantly. 

Although, until very recently, no attempt had been made for many
years to secure any bank or other secured financing due to management s practical conclusion that it would be an unproductive
allocation of human resources given our historic revenue and cash flow levels, internal financial ratios, and negative working
capital position, preliminary initiatives are currently underway to attempt to do so. There can be no assurance, however, that
we will be successful in securing any such financing unless and until our revenues and cash flows substantially increase, and our
internal financial ratios dramatically improve. 

Discontinued Operations   

On May 5, 2011, we entered into a Software Product Line
Purchase Agreement to sell the QuickVerse      product line
to WORDsearch. On June 30, 2011, closing of the asset sale transaction governed by the Software Product Line Purchase
Agreement, which was transitional in nature and expected to be ongoing through approximately the end of April, 2012,
commenced. As one of the initial parts of the closing, on July 1, 2011 WORDsearch assumed possession of the physical assets
conveyed in the transaction as well as control and responsibility of the business operations related to the QuickVerse      product
line, including, among many other things, the receipt of revenues for sales in exchange for partial payment of the cash
portion of the purchase price being paid to us. On April 13, 2012, we determined that the final closing conditions under the
Software Product Line Purchase Agreement had been met, and the sale of the QuickVerse      product
line to WORDsearch was complete. As a result, we have classified this asset as discontinued operations for the six months
ended September 30, 2016.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures   

As required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act,
our principal executive and principal financial officers are responsible for assessing the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Accordingly, we maintain disclosure controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and
forms. Our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer has evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q September 30, 2016, and has determined that such disclosure controls and
procedures are not effective. Our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as a result of the material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting because of inadequate segregation of duties over authorization, review and recording
of transactions as well as the financial reporting of such transactions. Management is attempting to develop a plan to mitigate
the above material weaknesses. 

Changes in Internal Controls   

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the fiscal quarter covered by this report, other than those disclosed above that materially affected, or is reasonable likely
to materially effect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED
SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.   

We relied in each case for these unregistered sales on the private offering exemption of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or the private offering safe harbor provision of Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder based on the following factors: (i) the number of offerees or purchasers, as applicable, (ii) the absence of general solicitation, (iii) representations obtained from the acquirer s relative to their accreditation and/or sophistication (or from offeree or purchaser representatives, as applicable), (iv) the provision of appropriate disclosure, and (v) the placement of restrictive legends on the certificates reflecting the securities coupled with investment representations obtained from the acquirer s.   

(1) Issued on the conversion of a convertible note with a non-related Party investor. The note payable with interest totaled $10,456 at $0.004 per share.   

(2) Issued as compensation for business development services. Consideration is valued at the closing price of the Company common stock on the relevant service day(s).   

Table of Contents      

(3) This was a sale of a convertible promissory note payable to an outside director, who is also a shareholder, for accrued director's fees earned through September 15, 2016. The note is dated September 21, 2016 and is due on demand, plus interest at 10% APR. It is convertible at $0.007 per share of common stock which equals 7,928,571 shares.   

(4) This was a sale of a convertible promissory note payable to an outside director, who is also a shareholder, for accrued director's fees earned through September 15, 2016.

The note is dated September 21, 2016 and is due on demand, plus interest at 10% APR. It is convertible at $0.007 per share of common stock which equals 3,671,429 shares.   

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.  

For the period ended September 30, 2016, we are in default under
a certain unsecured term note to a former shareholder in the total amount of approximately $47,000. The arrearage as of such date
was $28,783, plus interest. In accordance with the terms of the note, however, our default has triggered an acceleration of the
entire balance plus accumulated interest. In addition, we are in default under a certain unsecured term note to a current shareholder
in the total amount of $300,000 plus interest. However, the shareholder has agreed to extend the note for an additional twelve
months. In addition, we are in default under two convertible notes to an individual shareholder in the total amount of $33,000
plus interest. However, we made one payment in the amount of $10,000 in October 2016 which was applied to one of the convertible
notes leaving a balance of $23,000 owed to the individual shareholder. Finally, we were in default under a note to a current shareholder
in the total amount of $239,000 until, in October 2016, we negotiated a settlement and satisfaction of such note with the holder
for $17,950.

CERTIFICATION
OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER UNDER SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT    

I, Steven Malone,

2.    Based
                                         on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
                                         or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
                                         circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the
                                         period covered by this report;    

3.    Based
                                         on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in
                                         this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results
                                         of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented
                                         in this report;    

4.    The
                                         registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and
                                         maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)

a)      
         Designed
                                         such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures
                                         to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to
                                         the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others
                                         within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;    

b)      
         Designed
                                         such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over
                                         financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
                                         regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
                                         for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;    

c)      
         Evaluated
                                         the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented
                                         in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
                                         procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;
                                         and    

d)      
         Disclosed
                                         in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting
                                         that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s
                                         fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
                                         or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control
                                         over financial reporting; and    

5.    The
                                         registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
                                         evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors
                                         and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing
                                         the equivalent functions):    

a)      
         All
                                         significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
                                         control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                                         registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
                                         and    

b)      
         Any
                                         fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
                                         a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
