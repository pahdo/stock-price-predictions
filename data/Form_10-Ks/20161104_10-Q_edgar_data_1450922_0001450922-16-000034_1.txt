1. Organization    

The ETFS Silver Trust (the  Trust ) is an investment trust formed on July 20, 2009 (the  Date of Inception ) under New York law pursuant to a depositary trust agreement (the  Trust Agreement ) executed by ETF Securities USA LLC (the  Sponsor ) and the Bank of New York Mellon (the  Trustee ) at the time of the Trust s organization. The Trust holds silver bullion and issues ETFS Physical Silver Shares ( Shares ) (in minimum blocks of   5  0,000   Shares, also referred to as  Baskets ) in exchange for deposits of silver and distributes silver in connection with the redemption of Baskets   (effective August 11, 2016 the number of Shares in a block that constitutes a Basket for creations and redemptions in the Trust was reduced from   100,000   to   50,000  )  . Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust which are issued by the Trust. The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ETF Securities Limited, a Jersey, Channel Islands based company. The Trust is governed by the Trust Agreement.  

The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of silver, less the Trust s expenses and liabilities. The Trust is designed to provide an individual owner of beneficial interests in the Shares (a  Shareholder ) an opportunity to participate in the silver market through an investment in securities. The fiscal year end for the Trust is December 31.  

The accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q. In the opinion of the Trust s management, all adjustments (which consist of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations as of and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     and for all periods presented have been made.  

These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.

2. Significant Accounting Policies  

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires those responsible for preparing financial statements to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.  

2.1. Basis of Accounting 

The Sponsor has determined that the Trust falls within the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification (     ASC     )   946  ,    Financial Services Investment Co  mpanies   and has concluded that for reporting purposes, the Trust is classified as an Investment Company.  The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. 

2.2. Valuation of Silver  

The Trust follows the provisions of ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements    (     ASC 820     ). ASC 820 provides guidance for determining fair value and requires increased disclosure regarding the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 

Silver is held by HSBC Bank plc (the  Custodian ) on behalf of the Trust   at its London, England vaulting premises.     Silver   is recorded at fair value.    The cost of silver is determined according to the average cost method and the fair value is based on the   LBMA   Silver Price   (defined in the Trust s registration statement as the  London Silver Price )  .      Realized gains and losses on transfers of   silver  , or   silver   distributed for the redemption of Shares, are calculated on a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value and cost of   silver   transferred. 

Once the value of silver has been determined, the Net Asset Value (the  NAV     ) is computed by the Trustee by deducting all accrued fees and other liabilities of the Trust, including the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the  Sponsor s Fee ), from the fair value of the silver and all other assets held by the Trust. 

The Trust recognizes changes in fair value of the investment in silver as   changes in unrealized gains or losses on investment in silver   through the Statement of Operations.  

The per Share amount of silver exchanged for a purchase or redemption is calculated daily by the Trustee, using the   LBMA   Silver Price to calculate the silver amount in respect of any liabilities for which covering silver sales have not yet been made, and represents the per Share amount of silver held by the Trust, after giving effect to its liabilities, to cover expenses and liabilities and any losses that may have occurred.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

2.2.   Valuation of Silver (continued) 

Fair Value Hierarchy 

ASC 820 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs are as follows: 

Level 1.  

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access.  

Level 2.  

Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument on an inactive market, prices for similar instruments and similar data.  

Level 3.  

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, representing the Trust s own assumptions about the assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability, and that would be based on the best information available.  

To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3. 

The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 

The investment in silver is classified as a level 2 asset, as the   fair value of the   Trust s investment in silver is calculated   based upon   third party pricing sources supported by observable, verifiable inputs. 

The categorization of the Trust s assets is as shown below: 

There were   no   transfers between levels during the period ended   September 30, 2016   or the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

2.3. Silver Receivable and Payable    

Silver receivable or payable represents the quantity of silver covered by contractually binding orders for the creation or redemption of Shares respectively, where the silver has not yet been transferred to or from the Trust s account. Generally, ownership of the silver is transferred within three business days of the trade date.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

2.4. Creations and Redemptions of Shares  

The Trust expects to create and redeem Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets (a Basket equals a block of   5  0,000   Shares  .    Effective August 11, 2016 the number of Shares in a block that constitutes a Basket for creations and redemptions in the Trust was reduced from 100,000 to 50,000  .     Where Basket is used in this Form 10-Q it refers to a block of 50,000 Shares)   The Trust issues Shares in Baskets to Authorized Participants on an ongoing basis. Individual investors cannot purchase or redeem Shares in direct transactions with the Trust. An Authorized Participant is a person who (1) is a registered broker-dealer or other securities market participant such as a bank or other financial institution which is not required to register as a broker-dealer to engage in securities transactions, (2) is a participant in The Depository Trust Company, (3) has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Trustee and the Sponsor  ,   and (4) has established an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account with the Custodian or another silver bullion clearing bank to effect transactions in silver bullion. An Authorized Participant Agreement is an agreement entered into by each Authorized Participant, the Sponsor and the Trustee which provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of the silver required for such creations and redemptions. An Authorized Participant Unallocated Account is an unallocated silver account established with the Custodian by an Authorized Participant. 

The creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of silver represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received.  

Authorized Participants may, on any business day, place an order with the Trustee to create or redeem one or more Baskets. The typical settlement period for Shares is three business days. In the event of a trade date at period end, where a settlement is pending, a respective account receivable and/or payable will be recorded. When silver is exchanged in settlement of redemption, it is considered a sale of silver for financial statement purposes. 

The amount of bullion represented by the Baskets created or redeemed can only be settled to the nearest 1/1000th of an ounce. As a result, the value attributed to the creation or redemption of Shares may differ from the value of bullion to be delivered or distributed by the Trust. In order to ensure that the correct metal is available at all times to back the Shares, the Sponsor accepts an adjustment to its management fees in the event of any shortfall or excess   on each transaction  . For each transaction, this amount is not more than 1/1000th of an ounce.  

As the Shares of the Trust are subject to redemption at the option of Authorized Participants, the Trust has classified the outstanding Shares as Net Assets.  Changes in Shares are presented in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.   

2.5. Income Taxes  

The Trust is classified as a  grantor trust  for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, the Trust s income and expenses will  flow through  to the Shareholders, and the Trustee will report the Trust s proceeds, income, deductions, gains, and losses to the Internal Revenue Service on that basis.  

The Sponsor has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that   no   reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

Notes to the Financial Statements 

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

2.7.   Expenses /   Realized Gains / Losses 

The primary expense of the Trust is the Sponsor s Fee, which is paid by the Trust through in-kind transfers of silver to the Sponsor. 

The Trust will transfer silver to the Sponsor to pay the Sponsor s Fee that will accrue daily at an annualized rate equal to   0.45%   of the adjusted net asset value ( ANAV ) of the Trust, paid monthly in arrears. Presently, the Sponsor is continuing to   voluntarily   waive a portion of its fee and reduce the Sponsor s Fee to   0.30  % (which it has done since the Date of Inception).  

The Sponsor has agreed to assume administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust, including the Trustee s monthly fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and the reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses, exchange listing fees, United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and certain legal expenses.  

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   the Sponsor s Fee, net of fees waived by the Sponsor, was $  274,430   and $  209,204  , respectively.   For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   the Sponsor s Fee  , net of fees waived by the Sponsor,   was   $707,464   and   $650,950  , respectively. 

As a result of the waiver,   the     Sponsor s Fee   waived for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    w  as    $  137,215   and $  104,602  ,    and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     was     $353,732   and   $325,475  ,    respectively.       

At   September 30, 2016   and at   December 31, 2015  , the fees payable to the Sponsor were $  91,478   and $  63,486  , respectively. 

With respect to expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor, the Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s silver as necessary to pay these expenses. When selling silver to pay expenses, the Trustee will endeavor to sell the smallest amounts of silver needed to pay these expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than silver.  Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had   no   expenses during the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

Unless otherwise directed by the Sponsor, when selling silver the Trustee will endeavor to sell at the price established by the   LBMA   Silver Price. The Trustee will place orders with dealers (which may include the Custodian) through which the Trustee expects to receive the most favorable price and execution of orders. The Custodian may be the purchaser of such silver only if the sale transaction is made at the next   LBMA   Silver Price, or such other publicly available price that the Sponsor deems fair, in each case as set following the sale order. A gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the cost of the silver sold. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale. 

Realized gains and losses result from the transfer of   silver   for Share redemptions and / or to pay expenses and are recognized on a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value and cost of   silver   transferred. 

2.8. Subsequent Events 

In accordance with the provisions set forth in FASB ASC 855-10,   Subsequent Events  , the Trust s management has evaluated the possibility of subsequent events   impacting   the Trust s financial statements through the filing date.   During this period, no material subsequent events requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements were identified. 

11   

ETFS SILVER TRUST 

3. Related Parties  

The Sponsor and the Trustee are considered to be related parties to the Trust. The Trustee s and Custodian s fees are paid by the Sponsor and are not separate expenses of the Trust. The Trustee and the Custodian and their affiliates may from time to time act as Authorized Participants and purchase or sell Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  In addition the Trustee and the Custodian and their affiliates may from time to time purchase or sell silver directly, for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  

4. Concentration of Risk  

The Trust s sole business activity is the investment in silver and substantially all the Trust s assets are holdings of silver, which creates a concentration of risk associated with fluctuations in the price of silver. Several factors could affect the price of silver, including: (i) a change in economic conditions, such as a recession; (ii) investors  expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; (iii) currency exchange rates; (iv) interest rates; (v) investment and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds; and (vi) global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. In addition, there is no assurance that silver will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future. In the event that the price of silver declines, the Sponsor expects the value of an investment in the Shares to decline proportionately. Each of these events could have a material effect on the Trust s financial position and results of operations.  

5. Indemnification  

Under the Trust s organizational documents, the Trustee (and its directors, employees and agents) and the Sponsor (and its members, managers, directors, officers, employees and affiliates) are indemnified by the Trust against any liability, cost or expense it incurs without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part and without reckless disregard on its part of its obligations and duties under the Trust s organizational documents. The Trust s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred.

Introduction 

The Trust is a common law trust, formed under the laws of the state of New York on July 20, 2009. The Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. It does not have any officers, directors or employees and is administered by the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. It will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, nor is it a commodity pool, or subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with issuing Shares.  

The Trust holds silver and is expected to issue Baskets in exchange for deposits of silver, and to distribute silver in connection with redemptions of Baskets. Shares issued by the Trust represent units of undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of silver, less the Trust s expenses. The Sponsor believes that, for many investors, the Shares will represent a cost effective investment relative to traditional means of investing in silver.  

The Trust issues and redeems Shares only with Authorized Participants in exchange for silver   and   only in   one or more Baskets (a Basket equals a block of 50,000 Shares  .    Effective August 11, 2016 the number of Shares in a block that constitutes a Basket for creations and redemptions in the Trust was reduced from 100,000 to 50,000.   Where Basket is used in this Form 10-Q it refers to a block of 50,000 Shares).    A list of current Authorized Participants is available from the Sponsor or the Trustee. 

Shares of the Trust trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the  NYSE ) Arca under the symbol  SIVR .  

Valuation of Silver and Computation of Net Asset Value 

On each day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m. New York time on such day (the  Evaluation Time ), the Trustee values the silver held by the Trust and determines both the Adjusted Net Asset Value (the  ANAV ) and the Net Asset Value (the  NAV ) of the Trust. 

At the Evaluation Time, the Trustee values the Trust s silver on the basis of that day s   LBMA   Silver Price (the daily price of an ounce of silver as set at approximately 12:00 noon London, England time by LBMA-authorized bullion banks or market makers in an electronic, over-the-counter auction conducted by CME Group, Inc. and disseminated by Thomson Reuters   (defined in the Trust s registration statement as the  London Silver Price   ), or, if no   LBMA   Silver Price is made on such day or has not been announced by the Evaluation Time, the next most recent   LBMA   Silver Price determined prior to the Evaluation Time is used, unless the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. In the event the Sponsor determines that the   LBMA   Silver Price or such other publicly available price as the Sponsor may deem fairly represents the commercial value of the Trust s silver is not an appropriate basis for evaluation of the Trust s silver, it shall identify an alternative basis for such evaluation to be employed by the Trustee.   

Once the value of the silver held by the Trust has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all estimated accrued but unpaid fees (other than the fees accruing for such day on which the valuation takes place that are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets) expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the silver and all other assets of the Trust. The resulting figure is the ANAV of the Trust. The ANAV is used to compute the Sponsor s Fee.  

The Trustee then subtracts from the ANAV the amount of accrued Sponsor s Fee computed for such day to determine the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee also determines the NAV per Share by dividing the NAV of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on the NYSE Arca.

ETFS SILVER TRUST 

The Quarter Ended   September 30, 2016 

The NAV of the Trust is obtained by subtracting the Trust s liabilities on any day from the value of the silver owned and receivable by the Trust on that day; the NAV per Share is obtained by dividing the NAV of the Trust on a given day by the number of Shares outstanding on that day.  

The Trust s NAV   increase  d from $  339,845,104   at   June 30, 2016   to $  373,048,878   at   September 30, 2016  , a   9.77%     increase   for the quarter. The   increase   in the Trust s NAV resulted primarily from a  n     increase   in the price per ounce of silver, which   rose     5.39%   from $  18.36   at   June 30, 2016   to $  19.35   at   September 30, 2016   and an     increase   in outstanding Shares, which   rose   from   18,900,000   Shares at   June 30, 2016   to   19,700,000   Shares at   September 30, 2016  , a result of   800,000   Shares (  16   Baskets) being created   during the quarter.

NAV per   Share   increased     5.34%   from $  17.98   at   June 30, 2016   to $  18.94   at   September 30, 2016  . The Trust s NAV per Share   rose   slightly   less   than the price per ounce of silver on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s Fee, net of waiver, which was $  274,430   for the quarter, or 0.30% of the Trust s   ANAV   on an annualized basis. 

NAV per Share of $  20.28   at   August 2, 2016   was the highest during the quarter, compared with a low of   $18.11   at   August 25, 2016  . 

The   increase   in net assets from operations for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was $  17,782,451  , resulting from   a change in unrealized   gain   on investment in silver of   $18,061,028  ,     offset by   a realized loss of $  4,147   on the transfer of silver to pay expenses   and   the Sponsor s Fee  , net of waiver,   of $  274,430  . Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had no expenses during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .

The   increase   in the Trust s NAV resulted primarily from an   increase   in the price per ounce of silver, which   rose     40.01%   from   $13.82   at   December 31, 2015   to   $19.35   at   September 30, 2016   and an   increase   in outstanding Shares, which   rose   from   18,300,000   Shares at   December 31, 2015   to   19,700,000   Shares at   September 30, 2016  , a result of   1,600,000   Shares (  32   Baskets) being created and   200,000   Shares (  4   Basket  s  ) being redeemed during the period.  

NAV per Share   increased     39.68%   from   $13.56   at   December 31, 2015   to   $18.94   at   September 30, 2016  . The Trust s NAV per Share   rose   slightly   less   than the price per ounce of silver on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s Fee, net of waiver, which was   $707,464   for the period, or 0.30% of the Trust s ANAV on an annualized basis. 

NAV per Share of   $20.28   at   August 2, 2016   was the   highest during the period, compared with a low of   $13.32   at   January 28, 2016  . 

The   increase   in net assets from operations for the period ended   September 30, 2016   was   $99,720,382  , resulting from a change in unrealized   gain   on investment in silver of   $101,319,592  ,    offset by a realized   loss   of   $112,638   on the transfer of silver to pay expenses, a realized   loss   of   $779,108   on silver distribut  ed for the redemption of Shares     and   the Sponsor s Fee  , net of waiver,   of   $707,464  . Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had no expenses during the   period   ended   September 30, 2016  .

ETFS SILVER TRUST 

Liquidity   Capital Resources 

The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s Fee.  

The Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s silver as necessary to pay the Trust s expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor. The   Trustee will not sell silver to pay the Sponsor s Fee but will pay the Sponsor s Fee through in-kind transfers of silver to the Sponsor. At   September 30, 2016   the Trust did not have any cash balances.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    

The Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting policies.      In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of accounting policies.
