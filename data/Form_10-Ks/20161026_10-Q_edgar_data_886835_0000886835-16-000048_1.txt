Notes to Unaudited Condensed C  onsolidated Financial Statements 

Nine Months Ended September   30  , 2016 

(1)      Basis of Presentation 

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission   (SEC)  ; however, management believes the disclosures that are made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  These financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Superior Energy Services, Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein.  

The financial information of Superior Energy Services, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) for the   three and nine months ended September   30, 2016   and   2015   has not been audited.  However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for the periods presented have been included therein.  Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the   2016   presentation.  The resu  lts of operations for the   first     nine     months of the year are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that might be expected for the entire year.   

Due to the nature of the Company s business, the Company is involved, from time to time, in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims regarding its business activities. Legal costs related to these matters are expensed as incurred.  In management s opinion, none of the pending litigation, disputes or claims is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

The Company evaluates events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued for potential recognition or disclosure.  Based on the evaluation, the Company determined that there were no material subsequent events for recognition or disclosure other than those disclosed herein. 

(2)    Reduction in Value of Assets and Other Charges 

For the three and   nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2  015, the Company recorded $0, $462.5 million, $755.6 million and $1,563.3   million in expense related to the reduction in value of assets, respectively.  The components of the reduction in value of assets are as follows (in thousands): 

Reduction in Value of Goodwill 

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1  st   or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value.  Due to the prolonged downturn in the oil and gas industry and the impact it has had on the Company s activity levels, the Company s goodwill impairment evaluation as of June 30, 2016, indicated that the carrying values of the Onshore Completion and Workover Services and Production Services segments exceeded their fair values so that goodwill was potentially impaired.  The Company then performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which involved calculating the implied fair value of the segments  goodwill by allocating the fair values of the Onshore Completion and Workover Services and Production Services segments to all of their assets and liabilities (other than goodwill) and comparing them to the carrying amounts of the goodwill.  To estimate the fair value of the reporting unit (which is consistent with the reported business segment), the Company used a weighting of the discounted cash flow method and the public company guideline method of determining fair value of the reporting unit. The Company weighted the discounted cash flow method 80% and the public company guideline method 20% due to differences between the Company s reporting unit and peer companies  size, profitability and diversity of operations.

Table Of Contents  

During the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a $330.5 million reduction in value of goodwill relating to its Onshore Completion and Workover Services and Production Services segments.  The Company determined that the implied fair value of its goodwill for the Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment was less than its carrying value and recorded a   $140.0   million impairment of the Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment s goodwill.  In addition, the Company determined that the implied fair value of its goodwill for the Production Services segment was less than its carrying value and recorded a   $190.5   million impairment of the Production Services segment s goodwill.  The reduction in values of goodwill in the Onshore Completion and Workover Services and Production Services segments was primarily driven by further deterioration of market conditions during the period and the Company s forecast did not indicate a timely recovery sufficient to support the carrying values of the goodwill. 

During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded $740.0 million and $1,315.4 million in expense related to the reduction in value of goodwill, respectively.  During the three months ended June 30,   2015, the Company recorded a $575.4 million reduction in the value of goodwill relating to its Production Services segment.  The Company determined that the implied fair value of its goodwill for the Production Services segment was less than its carrying value and recorded a   $575.4   million impairment of the Production Services segment s goodwill.  The reduction in the value of goodwill in the Production Services segment was primarily driven by the decline in demand for coiled tubing services and the Company s forecast did not indicate a timely recovery sufficient to support the carrying value of the goodwill. 

During the three months ended September 30,   201  5, the Company recorded a $740.0   million reduction in the value of goo  dwill relating to its Onshore Completion and Workover   Services segment.  The Company determined that the implied fair value of   its goodwill for the Onshore Completion and Workover   Services segment was less than its carr  ying value and recorded a $740.0   milli  on impairment of the   segment s goodwill.  The reduction in the valu  e of goodwill in the Onshore Completion and Workover   Services segment was primarily driven by     deterioration of market conditions during the period and the Company s forecast did not indicate a timely recovery sufficien  t to support the carrying value   of the goodwill. 

At September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s accumulated reduction in value of goodwill was   $1,748.2   million and   $1,417.7   million, respectively. 

Reduction in Value of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of such assets to their fair value calculated, in part, by the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets.  Cash flow estimates are based upon, among other things, historical results adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market rates, utilization levels, and operating performance.  Estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance.  The Company s assets are grouped by line of business or division for the impairment testing, which represent the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.  If the asset grouping s fair value is less than the carrying amount of those items, impairment losses are recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of such assets exceeds the fair value.  The estimate of fair value represents the Company s best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability.   

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $0 and   $105.9 million  , respectively,   in connection with the reduction in value of its long-lived assets.  The reduction in value of assets was comprised of   $2.9   million related to equipment and   $45.9   million related to intangibles in the fluid management business in the Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment and   $12.4   million related to equipment and   $21.0   million related to intangibles, primarily relating to the cementing business in the Production Services segment.  In addition, the Company recorded   $23.7   million related to the reduction in carrying values of certain accommodation units included in the Drilling Products and Services segment.  The reduction in value of assets recorded during the second quarter of 2016 was primarily driven by the decline in demand for these services.  

During the three and nine months ended September 30,   2015, the Company recorded   $15.6 million and $166.0   million in connection with the reduction in value of its long-lived assets.  The reduction in value of assets was comprised of   $78.5   million related to equipment and   $58.8   million related to intangibles in the coiled tubing   and pressure control tools   business  es   in the Production Services segment and   $12.9   million related to mechanical drilling rigs included in the Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment.  In addition, the Company recorded   $15.8   million related to reduction in carrying values of certain international accommodation units included in the Drilling Products and Services segment.

Retirements of Long-Lived Assets 

During the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded   $23.9   million in the Drilling Products and Services segment for retirement   and   abandonment of excess and inoperable and/or functionally obsolete long-lived assets that would require a significant cost to refurbish.   

During the second quarter of 2015, the Company recorded $42.5 million for retirement and abandonment of inoperable and/or functionally obsolete long-lived assets that would require a significant cost to refurbish.  The total amount recorded includes   $27.3   million for the Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment and   $15.2   million for the Production Services segment.     

Reduction in Value of Assets Related to Sale of Coiled Tubing Business in Mexico 

During the second quarter of 2015, the Company sold its Mexico based coiled tubing business and related assets.  The Company received proceeds in the form of cash and a note receivable.  The Company recorded a full valuation allowance on the note receivable in the amount of   $16.8   million because its collectability was not reasonably assured.  In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a   $39.4   million reduction in value of assets, primarily related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. 

Other   Charges 

During   the three and nine months ended September   30, 2016, the Company recorded a   $2.3   million and   $22.8     million expense, respectively, primarily for severanc  e and facility closures. At September   30, 2016, the accrued lease termination liability balances were   $6.0   million and   $9.0   million  , included in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2015, the accrued lease termination liability balances were   $7.2   million and   $11.1   million, included in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet.       

(3  )      Inventory 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out or weighted-average cost methods for finished goods and work-in-process.  Supplies and consumables consist principally of products used in our services provided to customers.   The components of the inventory balances are as follows (in thousands): 

(4  )       Notes Receivable 

Notes receivable consist of a commitment from the seller of an oil and gas property   acquired by the Company related to   costs associated with the abandonment of the acquired property.  Pursuant to an agreement with the seller, the Company will invoice the seller an agreed upon amount at the completion of certain decommissioning activities.  The gross amount of this obligation totals $  115.0   million and is recorded at present value using an effective interest rate of   6.58  %.  The related discount is amortized to interest income based on the expected timing of completion of the decommissioning activities.  The Company recorded interest income related to notes receivable of   $  2  .  7   million and   $1  .  3   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively  .   

(5  )      Decommissioning Liabilities 

T  he Company s decommissioning liabilities associated with an oil and gas property and its related assets consist of costs related to the plugging of wells, the removal of the related pl  atform and equipment, and site restoration.  The Company reviews the adequacy of its decommissioning liabilities whenever indicators suggest that the estimated cash flows needed to satisfy the liabilities have changed materially.    The Company had decommissioning liabilities of   $  122  .  3   million and   $117.9   million at     September    3  0  , 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

(6)      Debt 

The Company s outstanding debt is as follows (in thousands): 

Credit Facility 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had a bank credit facility, comprised of a $  600.0   million revolving credit facility and a $  325.0   million term loan.  In February 2016, the Company amended and extended its credit facility, resulting in a   $470.3   million revolving credit facility that matures in 2019 and no longer has a term loan component.  In July 2016, the Company amended the credit facility and repaid the outstanding balance of   $250.0   million.  The amended agreement, among other things, reduces the size of the facility to   $400.0   million, suspends the maximum leverage ratio   covenant   until the fourth quarter of 2017 and replaces it with a senior secured debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio   covenant   during this period and modifies the restricted payment covenant to eliminate our ability to pay dividends and make equity repurchases until September 2017. 

Senior Unsecured Notes  

The Company has outstanding $  500   million of 6 3/8% unsecured senior notes due 2019.    The indenture governing the   6   3/8% senior notes requires semi-annual interest payments on May 1 and November 1     of each year through the maturity date of May 1, 2019.   

The Company also has outstanding $  800   million of   7   1/8% unsecured senior notes due 2021.  The indenture governing the 7 1/8% senior notes requires semi-annual interest payments on June 15 and December 15     of each year through the maturity date of December 15, 2021.   

(7  )    Derivative Financial Instruments 

From time to time, the Company may employ interest rate swaps in an attempt to achieve a more balanced debt portfolio between fixed and variable interest.  The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 

The Company has three interest rate swap agreements related to its fixed rate debt maturing in 2021 for notional amounts of $  100   million each, whereby the Company is entitled to receive semi-annual interest payments at a fixed rate of 7 1/8% per annum and is obligated to make semi-annual interest payments at floating rates, which are adjusted every   90   days, based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin. The swap agreements, scheduled to terminate on December 15, 2021, are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of the Company s 7 1/8% senior notes, as the derivatives have been tested to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the underlying notes.  As these derivatives are classified as fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are offset against the changes in the fair value of the underlying note in interest expense, net.    The Company recorded a derivative asset relating to these swaps of   $10.  9     million and   $6.9   million within intangible and other long term assets in the consolidated balance sheets   at   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , respectively  .

The location and effect of the derivative instruments on the condensed consolidated statement of operations, presented on a pre-tax basis, are as follows   (in thousands): 

For the   nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015  ,    approximately $  4.0   million and   $  3  .  0   million of interest income, respectively, was related to the ineffectiveness associated with these fair value hedges.  Hedge ineffectiveness represents the difference between the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments and the changes in fair value of the fixed rate debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate.   

(8  )    Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Inputs used in determining fair value are characterized according to a hierarchy that prioritizes those inputs based on the degree to which they are observable.  The three input levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows.    

Level 1  : Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 

Level 2  : Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or model-derived valuations or other inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3  : Unobservable inputs reflecting management s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.

Table Of Contents  

The following tables provide a summary of the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands): 

The Company s non-qualified deferred compensation plans allow officers, certain highly compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and contribute such amounts to one or more hypothetical investment funds.  The Company entered into separate trust agreements, subject to general creditors, to segregate assets of each plan and reports the accounts of the trusts in its condensed consolidated financial statements.  These investments are reported at fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identifiable assets and observable inputs for similar assets and liabilities, which represent Levels 1 and 2, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy.   

The fair value of the Company s cash equivalents, accounts receivable and current maturities of long-term debt approximates their carrying amounts.  The fair value of the Company s long-term debt was   approximately $  1,282  .  0   million and $  1,508.0     million   as of September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The fair value of these debt instruments is determined by reference to the market value of the instruments as quoted in over-the-counter markets, which are Level 1 inputs. 

The following table reflects the fair value measurements used in testing the impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill (in thousands): 

Fair value is measured as of the impairment date using Level 3 inputs.  See note 2 for discussion of reduction in value of assets   and other charges  .

Table Of Contents  

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on income or loss from operations.  The segment measure is calculated as follows: segment revenues less segment operating expenses, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense, reduction in value of assets and allocated general and administrative expenses.  General and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based primarily on specific identification and, to the extent that such identification is not practical, other methods that the Company believes to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided.  The Company believes this segment measure is useful in evaluating the performance of its reportable segments because it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons.

(  10  )      Stock-Based Compensation Plans  

The Company maintains various stock incentive plans that provide long-term incentives to the Company s key employees, including officers, directors, consultants and advisors (Eligible Participants).  Under the stock incentive plans, the Company may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, other stock-based awards or any combination thereof to Eligible Participants.  The Company s total compensation expense related to these plans was approximately   $  32  .  4   million   and $  3  4.  0   million for the   nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, which is reflected in general and administrative expenses. 

(11)    Income Taxes 

The Company   had $  29.7   million   of unrecorded tax benefits   at   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  ,   all of which would impact the Company s effective tax rate if recognized.  It is the Company s policy to recognize interest and applicable penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  

(12  )         Earnings per Share 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same manner as basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that could have been outstanding assuming the exercise of stock options and the conversion of restricted stock units. 

For the   three and     nine   months ended   September     3  0  , 201  6 and 2015  , the Company incurred a loss from co  ntinuing operations; therefore   the impact of any incremental shares would be anti-dilutive.

Executive Summary 

General 

We provide a wide variety of services and products to the energy industry.  We serve major, national and independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies around the world throughout the various phases of a well s economic life cycle.  We report our results in four segments: Drilling Products and Services; Onshore Completion and Workover Services; Production Services; and Technical Solutions.   

Industry Trends 

The oil and gas industry is   both   highly cyclical and seasonal.  The level of spending by oil and gas companies is highly influenced by current and expected   demand and   future prices o  f oil and natural gas  . Changes in spending result in an increased or decreased demand for our services and products. Rig count is an indicator of the level of spending by oil and gas companies. Our financial performance is significantly affected by the rig count in the U  .  S  .   land and offshore market area as well as oil and natural gas prices and worldwide rig activity, which are summarized in the tables below.

Table Of Contents  

(1)   Estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on Baker Hughes Incorporated rig count information. 

(2)   Excludes Canadian Rig Count. 

Outlook 

Lower oil prices throughout the first nine months of 2016 have led to the reduction in drilling and completion activity by our customers.  The reduction in our customers  capital expenditure budgets and spending plans has had a direct impact on our revenues both through lower activity levels as well as pressure on pricing.  The ultimate impact on us of the current downturn will depend upon its length and several other factors, many of which are beyond our control.  We will continue refining our business and adjusting our cost structure to respond to market conditions.  Additionally, we believe our businesses have competitive advantages to respond quickly when the market ultimately recovers. 

Sequential results by segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 

For   the   three months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenue   was   $326.2   million and   net   loss from continuing operations was   $113.9   million, or    a     $0.75   loss per share.  Net loss was   $118.0   million, or $  0.78   loss per   share.       

Third   quarter 201  6   revenue in our Drilling Products and Services segment   decreased 21% sequentially to $63.6 million, as compared to $80.7 million in the second quarter of 2016.  U.S.   land revenue increased     30  % sequentially to $  15.2 million due to the increase in drilling activity during the quarter.  This increase was offset by a decrease in revenue from Gulf of Mexico and international market areas.    Gul  f of Mexico revenue decreased 32% sequentially to $26.5   million and i  nternational revenue decreased 27% sequentially to $21.9   million   due to the decrease in drilling activity in those markets  .   

Third quarter 2016 revenue in   our Onshore Completion and Workover   Services segment increased     8  % sequentially to $  125.0     million, as compared to   $  115.9     million in the   second   quarter of 201  6  .  All of this segment s revenue is derived f  rom the U.S. land market area.  On a sequential basis, the revenue increase was driven primarily by higher well fracturing utilization as completion activity increased during the quarter.   

Third   quarter 201  6   revenue in ou  r Production Services segment   decreased     9  % sequentially to $  73.6   million, as compared to $  80.5     million in the   second   quarter of 201  6. U.S. land revenue decreased 6  %   sequentially to $  19.3   million   primarily due to lower levels of coiled tubing activity.  I  nternational revenue decreased   10  % sequentially to $  40.1 million and   Gulf of Mexico revenue   de  creased   9  % sequentially to $  14.2   mill  ion, primarily as a result of de  creased   hydraulic workover and snubbing operations  . 

Third   quarter 201  6   revenue in our Technical Solu  tions segment decreased 19% sequentially   to $  64.0   million  , as compared to $79.2     million in the second   quarter   of 2016  .  U.S  . land revenue increased     17  % sequentially to $  10.7   million   primarily due to increased well control activity.     Gul  f of Mexico revenue   decreased   34  % sequentially to $  32.7   million   due to the decreased completion tools revenue and lower subsea intervention activity.  International revenue remained unchanged at $20.6     million  .    

Comparison of the Results of Operations for the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

For the   three months ended   September 30, 2016  , our revenue was   $326.2   million  , a decrease of $275.2 million or 46%, as compared to the same period of 2015.  The decline is largely attributable to a 29% decline in the worldwide rig count which has led to widespread pricing pressure.  The net   los  s from continuing operations was $113.9   million, or a $  0.75   loss   per share.  Net loss was $  118.0   million,   or a $  0.78   loss   per share.  This compares to a net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2015 of $  816.6   million, or   a $  5.42   loss per   share.  Net   loss   was   $821.2   million, o  r a $  5.45   loss per share.  Included in the results for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was a pre-tax charge for $755.6 million related to the reduction in value of assets.

The following table compares our operating results for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (in thousands, except percentages).  Cost of services and rentals excludes depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion   for each of our business segments  .   

The following provides a discussion of our results on a segment basis: 

Drilling Products and Services Segment 

Revenue from our Drilling Products and   Services segment decreased   51  % to $  63.6   million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $128.5   million for the same period in 201  5  .    The decline in revenue in this segment is due to the low rig count, lower pricing and customer budget constraints.   Cost of services   and rentals   as a percentage of revenue increased to   47%   of segment revenue for the   three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   34%   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to a decrease in revenue  .  Revenue from our Gulf of Mexico market   area decreased 52  %,   revenue generated from our U.  S. land market area decreased 54  % and revenue from our inte  rnational market area decreased 45  %.        The decline in revenue in these market areas is primarily attributable to decreases in revenues from rentals of premium drill pipe, bottom hole assemblies and accommodation units, as demand for these rental products decreased along with the worldwide rig count.   

Onshore Completion and Workover Services Segment 

Revenue from our Onshore Completion and Workov  er Services segment decreased 38  % to $  125.0   million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $202.9   million for the same period in 2015.      All of this segment s revenue is derived from the U.S. land market area  , in which rig count was down 45%  .  Cost of services   and rentals   as a percentage of revenues increased to   100%   of   segment revenue from 86% in the third quarter of 2015   primarily due to   a    significant decrease in revenue.  The decre  ase in revenue is primarily due to a   decline in activity and pricing for our services, primarily   in our   pressure pumping and fluid management   businesses  .  These services were impacted negatively by reduced customer spending and activity as well as continued pricing pressure in Nor  th America during the quarter.  D  u  ring the three months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorde  d $740.0   million in reduction in valu  e of assets.      

Production Services Segment 

Revenue from our Production Services segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by 55  % to $  73.6   million, as compared to   $163.9   million for the same period in   2015  .    The decline in revenue in this seg  ment is due to   low rig count, lower pricing and customer budget constraints.        Cost of services and rentals as a percentage of revenue increased to   85%   of segment revenue from   79%   in the third   quarter of 2015  , primarily as a result of the decrease in revenue  .    Revenue derived from the Gulf of Mexico market area increased 15% primaril  y due to increased activity in   hydraulic workover and snubbing and well services.  Revenue from the U.S. land market area decreased 78% and revenue from international market areas decreased 39%, primarily due to decreased activity in h  ydraulic workover and snubbing operations  .    D  u  ring the three months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorde  d $15.6   million in reduction in valu  e of assets.      

Technical Solutions Segment 

Revenue from our Technical Solutions   segment decreased 40  % to $  64.0 million for   the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to $  106.1   million for the same period in   2015  .    The decline in revenue in this segment is due to low rig count, lower pricing and customer budget constraints.    Cost of services   and rentals as a percentage of revenue de  creased to   63%   of segment revenue from   68%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .    Revenue derived from the Gulf of Mexico market area decreased 49%, primarily due to a decrease in demand for well control services and completion tools and products.  In addition, the decrease in revenue was also attributable to the discontinuation of our marine technical services business due to the termination of the contract with its customer.  Revenue from the U.S. land market area decreased 33% and revenue from the international market area decreased 21%, primarily due to a decrease in demand for completion tools and products.

Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion 

Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion decreased to $123.3   million   during   the three months   ended     September 30, 2016     from     $  146.8     million during   the same period in   2015  .   Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for our Drilling Products and Services segment by $8.8 million, or 18%; for our Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment by $2.5     million, or 5%; for our Production Services segment by $8.5 million, or 28% and for our Technical Solutions segment by $3.7     million, or 25%.  The decrease in depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion is primarily due to lower asset values as a result of the impairments recorded during the second half of 2015 as well as reduced capital expenditures. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses were $86.7   million   for the three months   ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   $123.2     million   for the same period in   2015  .    The de  crease   is primarily attributable to significant cost reduction initiatives that resulted in lower levels of   employee   and infrastructure  -related expenses  . 

Reduction in Value of Assets 

The reduction in value of assets recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2015 included $740.0 million related to the Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment goodwill impairment and $15.6 million related to the write-off of intangibles within the Production Services segment.   

Other Income/Expense 

Other income/expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $3.7 million income as compared to $3.1 million expense for the same period in 2015. The increase in other income is primarily attributable to foreign currency translations. 

Income Taxes 

Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 29% compared to a 6% effective tax rate for the same period in 2015.    The difference in the effective tax rate from the statutory rate is primarily due to the reduction in value of goodwill which is non-deductible for income tax purposes. 

Discontinued Operations 

Loss   from discontinued operations, net of   tax,   was   $4.1   million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared   to   $4.6   million for the same period in   2015  .       

Comparison of the R  esults of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September   30, 2016 and 2015  

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our   revenue was   $1,095.6   million,   a decrease of $1,133.8 million or 51%, as compared to the same period of 2015.  The decline is largely attributable to a 36% decline in the worldwide rig count which has led to widespread pricing pressure.  Net   los  s from continuing operations was $667.1   million, or a $  4.40   loss per share.  Net loss was   $675.7   million, or a $  4.46   loss per share.  Included in the results for th  e nine months ended September   30, 2016 were pre-tax charges of $  462.5   million related to the reduct  ion in value of assets and $22.8   million   for severance and facility closures.    For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , revenue was     $2,229.4   million and   net     loss   from continuing operations was   $1,593.2   million, or   a $  10.60   loss per   share.  Net   loss   was   $1,617.3   million, o  r a $  10.76   loss per share.  Included in the results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was a pre-tax charge for $1,563.3 million related to the reduction in value of assets.       

The following table compares our operating results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     (in thousands, except percentages).  Cost of services and rentals excludes depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion   for each of our business segments  .

The following provides a discussion of our results on a segment basis: 

Drilling Products and Services Segment 

Revenue from our Drilling Products and   Services segment decreased   49  %    to   $240.8 million for the nine months ended September   30, 2016, as compared to   $471.5   million for the same period in 2015.    The decline in revenue in this segment is due to low rig count, lower pricing and customer budget constraints.    Cost of services and rentals as a percentage of revenue increased to   42%   of segment revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   33%   for the same period in 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in revenue  .  Revenue from our   Gulf of Mexico market   area decreased 45  %,   revenue generated from our U.  S. land market area decreased 65  % and revenue from our international market area decreased   39  %.    The decline in revenue in these market areas is primarily attributable to decreases in revenues from rentals of premium drill pipe, bottom hole assemblies and accommodation units, as demand for these rental products decreased along with the worldwide rig count.    In addition,     during the   nine months ended September   30, 2016, we recorded $  47.7   million in reduction in value of assets as compared to $  15.8   million recorded for the same period in 2015.          

Onshore Completion and Workover Services Segment 

Revenue from our Onshore Completion and Workov  er Services segment decreased 52  % to   $373.4   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to $780.5 million for the same period in 2015.    All of this segment s revenue is derived from the U.S. land market area  , in which rig count was down 55%  .  Cost of services   and rentals   as a percentage of revenues increased to   97%   of   segment revenue from   78%   in the same period in 2015,   primarily due to    a   significant decrease in revenue.  The decrease in revenue is primarily due to    a   decline in activity and pricing for our services, primarily   in our   pressure pumping and fluid management   businesses  .  These services were impacted negatively by reduced customer spending and activity as well as continued pricing pressure in North America during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    In addition, during the nine months ended September   30, 2016, we recorded $  188.7   million in reduction in value of assets as compared to $  780.2   million recorded for the same period in 2015.          

Production Services Segment 

Revenue from our Production Services segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased by 60  % to   $250.8   million, as compared to   $624.0   million for the same period in 2015.    The decline in revenue in this seg  ment is due to   low rig count, lower pricing and customer budget constraints.     Cost of services and rentals as a percentage of revenue increased to   80%   of segment revenue from   77%   in the same period in   2015  , primarily as a result of a decrease in revenue  .    Revenue derived from the Gulf of Mexico market area decreased 23%, primarily due to   a    decrease in electric line activity.  Revenue from the U.S. land market area decreased 80%, primarily due to decreased activity in coiled tubing, electric line and slickline services.  Revenue from international market areas decreased 41%, primarily due to decreased activity from hydraulic workover and snubbing, electric line and coiled tubing services.     In addition,     during the   nine months ended September   30, 2016, we recorde  d $226.1   million in reduction in valu  e of assets as compared to $767.3   million recorded for the same period in   2015.      

Technical Solutions Segment 

Revenue from our Technical Solutions   segment decreased 35  % to   $230.6   million   for   the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $353.5   million for the same period in   2015  .  The decline in revenue in this segment is due to low rig count, lower pricing and customer budget constraints.    Cost of services   and rentals as a percentage of revenue de  creased to   59%   of segment revenue from   64%   in the same period in   2015  .    Revenue derived from the Gulf of Mexico market area decreased 38%, primarily due to a decrease in demand for well control services and completion tools and products.  In addition, the decrease in revenue was also attributable to the discontinuation of our marine technical services business due to the termination of the contract with its customer.  Revenue from the U.S. land market area decreased 39% and revenue from the international market area decreased 24%, primarily due to a decrease in demand for completion tools and products.

Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion decreased to $392.0   million   during   the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     from     $467.3     million during   the same period in   2015  .   Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for our Drilling Products and Services segment by $15.8 million, or 11%; for our Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment by $10.2 million, or 6%; for our Production Services segment by $37.4 million, or 35%, and for our Technical Solutions segment by $11.9 million, or 26%.  The decrease in depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion is primarily due to lower asset values as a result of the impairments recorded during the second half of 2015 as well as reduced capital expenditures. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses   were   $270.5   million for   the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $403.8     million   for the same period in   2015  .    The de  crease   is primarily attributable to significant cost reduction initiatives that resulted in lower levels of   employee   and infrastructure  -related expenses  . 

Reduction in Value of Assets 

Reduction in value of assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $462.5 million as compared to $  1,563.3   million for the same period in 2015. The reduction in value of assets recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $190.5 million related to the Production Services segment goodwill impairment and $140.0 million related to the Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment goodwill impairment. In addition, the reduction in value of assets expense included $132.0 million related to reduction in value and retirements of long-lived assets within the Drilling Products and Services, Onshore Completion and Workover Services and Production Services segments.  The reduction in value of assets recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included $740.0 million related to the Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment goodwill impairment, $575.4 million related to the Production Services segment goodwill impairment and $247.9 million related to reduction in value and retirements of long-lived assets within the Production Services, Onshore Completion and Workover Services and Drilling Products and Services segments. 

Other Income/Expense 

Other income/expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $22.1 million income as compared to a $10.6 million loss for the same period in 2015. The increase in other income is primarily attributable to foreign currency translations.   

Income Taxes 

Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 24% compared to a 9% effective tax rate for the same period in 2015.  The difference in the effective tax rate from the statutory rate is primarily due to the reduction in value of goodwill which is non-deductible for income tax purposes. 

Discontinued Operations 

Loss   from discontinued operations, net of   tax,   was   $8.6   million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared   to   $24.1   million for the same period in   2015  .    Loss from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a $15.5 million reduction in value of the marine vessels.    

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

In   the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we generated net cash from operating activities   of   $146.7   million, as compared to   $565.5   million in the same period of   2015  .  Our primary liquidity needs are for working capital and capital expenditures.  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility.  We had cash and cash equivalents of   $278.2   million at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $564.0   million at   December 31, 2015  .    In July 2016   we made a $250.0 million payment on our revolving credit facility   and currently have no outstanding debt balances under the revolving credit facility  .        At   September 30, 2016  , approximately $  58.3   million of our cash balance was held outside the United States.  Cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions could be repatriated to the United   States,   however, they would be subject to federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits.    We have not provided U.S. income tax expense on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we expect to reinvest the undistributed earnings indefinitely.       

We   spent   $74.1   million of   cash on capital   expenditures   during   the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .    A  pproximately   $  37.4     million was used to   expand and maintain our Drilling Products and Services segment s equipment inventory, and approximately $  15.8     million, $  17.3     million and $  3.6     million   was spent to   maintain the asset bases of our Onshore Completion and Workover Services, Production Services and Technical Solut  ions segments, respectively  .

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we generated $72.6 million of free cash flow.  We define free cash flow as operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Cash flows from operations included a $36.0 million income tax refund received during the second quarter of 2016. 

During the first quarter of 2016, we paid $12.1 million of dividends to stockholders.  We have since announced that the Company has eliminated the quarterly dividend program.  

At September 30, 2016, we had $35.4   million   of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility.  In July 2016, we amended the credit facility and repaid the outstanding balance of $250.0 million with cash on hand.  The amended agreement, among other things, reduces the size of the facility to $400.0 million,   suspends   the maximum leverage ratio covenant until the fourth quarter of 2017 and replaces it with a senior secured debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio covenant during this period and modifies the restricted payment covenant to eliminate our ability to pay dividends and make equity repurchases until September 2017.  At October 24, 2016, we had   $  35.7   million of let  ters of credit outstanding under the credit facility.     Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus margins that depend on our   credit rating.  Indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including the pledge of the stock of our principal domestic subsidiaries.   The credit facility contains customary events of default and requires that we satisf  y various financial covenants.  The credit facility also limits our ability to pay dividends or make distributions, make acquisitions, create liens or incur additional indebtedness. At     September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all such covenants. 

We have outstanding $500 million of 6 3/8% unsecured senior notes due 2019.   The indenture governing the 6 3/8% senior notes requires semi-annual interest payments on May 1 and November 1     of each year through the maturity date of May 1, 2019.  The indenture contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various covenants.     At     September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all such covenants. 

We also have outstanding $800 million of 7 1/8% unsecured senior notes due 2021.  The indenture governing the 7 1/8% senior notes requires semi-annual interest payments on June 15 and December 15     of each year through the maturity date of December 15, 2021.  The indenture contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various covenants.     At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all such covenants. 

Hedging Activities 

We have three interest rate swap agreements for notional amounts of $100 million each related to our 7 1/8% senior notes maturing in December 2021, whereby we are entitled to receive semi-annual interest payments at a fixed rate of 7 1/8% per annum and are obligated to make semi-annual interest payments at variable rates.  The variable interest rates, which are adjusted every 90 days, are based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin and are   scheduled to terminate on December 15, 2021.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

At   September 30, 2016  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We are exposed to market risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates.  A discussion of our market risk exposure in financial instruments follows. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Risk 

Because we operate in a number of countries throughout the world, we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  The functional currency for our international operations, other than certain operations in the United Kingdom and Europe, is the U.S. dollar, but a portion of the revenues from our international operations is paid in foreign currencies.  The effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partly mitigated because local expenses of such international operations are also generally denominated in the same currency.  We continually monitor the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in the U.S. dollar.   

Assets and liabilities of certain subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Europe are translated at end of period exchange rates, while income and expenses are translated at average rates for the period.  Translation gains and losses are reported as the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders  equity.

Table Of Contents  

We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes or use derivatives with complex features. When we believe prudent, we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We do not enter into forward foreign exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes.  At     September 30, 2016  , we had no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts.  

Interest Rate Risk 

At   September 30, 2016  ,   our debt was comprised of the following (in thousands): 

Variable debt of $300 million represents the portion of the $800 million aggregate principal amount of our 7 1/8% senior notes subject to the fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements.   Based on the amount of this debt outstanding   as of     September 30, 2016  , a 10% increase in the variable interest rate would have increased our interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   by approximately $  1.2   million, while a 10% decrease would have decreased our interest expense by approximately $  1.2   million  .    

Commodity Price Risk 

Our revenues, profitability and future rate of growth significantly depend upon the market prices of oil and natural gas.  Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and   natural   gas that can economically be produced.

b. 

Changes in internal control  .  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the     three months ended September 30, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting  .

5   

undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant s Pro Rata Share in the Issuing Lender s obligations and rights under and in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amount of each draft paid by the Issuing Lender thereunder.  Each L/C Participant agrees with the Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (or in the event that any reimbursement received by the Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by it at any time), such L/C Participant shall pay in U.S. Dollars to the Issuing Lender upon demand at the Issuing Lender s address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant s Pro Rata Share of the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the amount that is not so reimbursed (or is so returned).  Each L/C Participant s obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant may have against the Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Article IV, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other L/C Participant or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

2.2.5           Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower  .  If any draft is paid under any Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Lender for the amount of (a) the draft so paid in the currency in which such Letter of Credit was issued and (b) any taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such payment, not later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such draft, if such notice is received on such day prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time if such Letter of Credit is denominated in U.S. Dollars or Canadian dollars, or (ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice.  Each such payment shall be made to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices referred to herein in the currency in which such draft is payable (except that, in the case of any Letter of Credit denominated in any currency other than Dollars, upon notice by the Issuing Lender to the Borrower, such payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars from and after the date on which the amount of such payment shall have been converted into Dollars at the Spot Exchange Rate on such date of conversion, which date of conversion shall be selected by the Issuing Lender and may be any Business Day after the date on which such payment is due) and in immediately available funds.  Interest shall be payable on any such amounts from the date on which the relevant draft is paid until payment in full at (x) until the Business Day next succeeding the date of the relevant notice, the Floating Rate and (y) thereafter, the rate set forth in Section 2.10; provided, that if any such amount is denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars for any period, such interest shall be payable for such period at the Alternate Currency Overnight Rate. If, as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and any Alternate Currency, the amount of the L/C Obligations exceeds 105% of the L/C  

6   

Commitment, then the Borrower shall deposit within three Business Days of demand by the Administrative Agent as cash collateral, an amount in U.S. Dollars equal to such excess. The obligation to deposit amounts shall be absolute and unconditional, without regard to whether any beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit has attempted to draw down all or a portion of such amount under the under the terms of a Letter of Credit. If (1) the Borrower was required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the L/C Obligations exceeding the L/C Commitment due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and any applicable Alternate Currency (2) the L/C Obligations no longer exceed the L/C Commitment and (3) the Borrower is not otherwise required to post cash collateral in respect of the Letters of Credit hereunder which has not been posted, then the amount of such excess shall be returned to such Borrower within five Business Days upon request of the Borrower. 

2.9.         Amendment to Article 2. Article 2 is hereby amended by adding the following as the new Section 2.20:  

2.20            Currency Indemnity  . The Borrower shall, and shall cause the other Loan Parties to, make payment relative to any Obligation (including with respect to Letters of Credit) in the currency in which such Obligation was effected (the  Agreed Currency ).  If any payment is received on account of any Obligation in any currency other than the Agreed Currency (the  Other Currency ) (whether voluntarily or pursuant to an order or judgment or the enforcement thereof or the realization of any collateral under the Collateral Documents or the liquidation of a Loan Party or otherwise), such payment shall constitute a discharge of the liability of the Loan Parties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in respect of such obligation only to the extent of the amount of the Agreed Currency which the relevant Lender or Agent, as the case may be, is able to purchase with the amount of the Other Currency received by it on the Business Day next following such receipt in accordance with its normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction and applicable law after deducting any costs of exchange.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if the amount of the Other Currency received is insufficient to satisfy the obligation in the Agreed Currency in full, then the Borrower shall on demand indemnify the Issuing Lenders, Lenders and the Administrative Agent from and against any loss or cost arising out of or in connection with such deficiency; provided that if the amount of the Agreed Currency so purchased is greater than the amount of the Agreed Currency due in respect of such liability immediately prior to such judgment or order, voluntary prepayment, realization of collateral, liquidation of a Loan Party or otherwise, then the Agents or the Lenders, as the case may be, agree to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the foregoing indemnity and agreement by each party shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from all other obligations contained in this Agreement and shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action.
