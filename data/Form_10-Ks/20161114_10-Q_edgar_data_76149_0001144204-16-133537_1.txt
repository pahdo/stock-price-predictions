  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  ( UNAUDITED )  

NOTE 1    BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements of Paradise, Inc. (the  Company ) have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. 

The information furnished herein reflects
all adjustments and accruals of a normal recurring nature that management believes are necessary to fairly state the operating
results for the respective periods. The notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. The Company s management believes that the disclosures are sufficient for interim financial reporting purposes. 

Consumer demand for glace  fruit
product is traditionally strongest during the Thanksgiving and Christmas season. Almost 80% of glace  fruit product sales
are recorded during an eight to ten week period beginning in mid September. Therefore, the operating results for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the current year. 

Certain minor reclassifications have
been made to the consolidated unaudited financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 to conform
to the classifications used for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

NOTE 2    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which requires an entity
to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard will be
effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, which is the effective date for public companies. Early application is permitted
as of January 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company
is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not
yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , which amends FASB ASU Topic 330,  Inventory .
This ASU requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and eliminates the option that currently
exists for measuring inventory at market value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of
business, less reasonable predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU should be applied prospectively
with earlier application permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the Company s
financial position or results of operations.

  ( UNAUDITED )  

NOTE 2    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (CONTINUED)  

In November 2015,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740) Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which simplifies
the presentation of deferred income taxes. The ASU provides presentation requirements to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities
as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for any interim and annual financial statements that
have not yet been issued. The new guidance may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively
to all periods presented. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

In February
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)(ASU 2016-02).  Under ASU No. 2016-2, an entity will be
required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about
leasing arrangements. ASU No. 2016-02 offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback
transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing
arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising
from leases. For public companies, ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early
adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Except as noted above, the Company s
management does not believe that recent codified pronouncements by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
(including its EITF), the AICPA or the Securities and Exchange Commission will have a material impact on the Company s current
or future consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 3    INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

NOTE 4    BUSINESS SEGMENT DATA  

The Company s operations are
conducted through two business segments. These segments, and the primary operations of each, are as follows: 

Business Segment    
       
        Operation     

Fruit  
       
      Production of candied fruit, a basic fruitcake ingredient, sold to manufacturing bakers, institutional users, and retailers for use in home baking.  Also, based on market conditions, the processing of frozen strawberry products, for sale to commercial and institutional users such as preservers, dairies, drink manufacturers, etc.   

Molded Plastics  
       
      Production of plastics containers and other molded plastics for sale to various food processors and others.

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(CONTINUED)  

  ( UNAUDITED )  

NOTE 4    BUSINESS SEGMENT DATA (CONTINUED)  

The Company does not prepare operating
profit or loss information on a segment basis for internal use, until the end of each year. Due to the seasonal nature of the fruit
segment, management believes that it is not practical to prepare this information for interim reporting purposes. Therefore, reporting
is not required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Identifiable assets by segment are
those assets that are principally used in the operations of each segment. General corporate assets are principally cash, prepaid
expenses, other current assets, land and income tax assets.

Condition and Results of Operations  

Forward Looking Statements   

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
contains  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact should be considered  forward-looking statements 
for the purpose of these provisions, including statements that include projections of, or expectations about, earnings, revenues
or other financial items, statements about our plans and objectives for future operations, statements concerning proposed new products
or services, statements regarding future economic conditions or performance, statements concerning our expectations
regarding the attraction and retention of customers, statements about market risk and statements underlying any of the foregoing.
In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of such terminology as  may ,  will ,
 expects ,  potential , or  continue , or the negative thereof or other similar words. Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such
expectations or any of our forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Actual results and developments are likely to be
different from, and may be materially different from, those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. 

Overview   

Paradise, Inc. s main business
segment, glace  fruit, a prime ingredient of fruitcakes and other holiday confections, represented 68.3% of total net sales
for the previous year of 2015. These products are sold to manufacturing bakers, institutional users, supermarkets and other retailers
throughout the country. Consumer demand for glace  fruit product is traditionally strongest during the Thanksgiving and Christmas
season. Almost 80% of glace  fruit product sales are recorded for a period of eight to ten weeks beginning in mid September. 

Since the majority of the
Company s customers require delivery of glace  fruit products during this relatively short period of time,
Paradise, Inc. must operate at consistent levels of production from as early as January through the middle of November of
each year in order to meet peak demands. Furthermore, the Company must make substantial borrowings of short-term working
capital to cover the cost of raw materials, factory overhead and labor expense associated with production for inventory. This
combination of building and financing inventories during the year, without the opportunity to record any significant fruit
product income, may result in the generation of operating losses well into the third quarter of each year. Therefore, it is
the opinion of management that meaningful forecasts of annual net sales or profit levels require analysis of a full
year s operations. 

In addition, comparison of current
quarterly results to the preceding quarter produces an incomplete picture on the Company s performance due to year-to-year
changes in production schedules, seasonal harvests and availability of raw materials, and in the timing of customer orders and
shipments. Thus, the discussion of information presented within this report is focused on the review of the Company s current
year-to-date results as compared to the similar period last year. 

Paradise, Inc. s other business
segment, Paradise Plastics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Paradise, Inc. produces custom molding products, is not subject
to the seasonality of the glace  fruit business. This segment represents all injection molding and thermoforming operations,
including the packaging for the Company s fruit products. Only sales to unaffiliated customers are reported. 

PART I.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  

The First Nine Months   

Paradise, Inc. s fruit
segment net sales for the first nine months of 2016 increased 2.8% to $8,643,663 compared to $8,409,947 for the similar nine
month reporting period of 2015. This increase is primarily due to timing differences in the receipt of customers 
orders and the corresponding shipping dates for delivery of the Company s retail glace  fruit products. Changes
in dates of opening orders from customers between interim reporting periods will have a direct impact on net revenue
comparisons. Paradise, Inc. recognizes net sales generally upon receipt of its products by its customers. Thus, as
merchandise is shipped and received by its customers during different interim reporting periods, timing differences in
reported net revenue will occur. Management has consistently disclosed that interim filings are not reliable financial
indicators of year-end performance. Only after a full year s selling season is completed which takes into consideration
factors such as the timing of initial orders, product placement on supermarket shelves and consumer demand
for holiday fruitcake ingredients, will the Company have any ability to determine whether its sales and marketing efforts for
the current year were successful. 

Paradise Plastics, Inc.,
a wholly owned company of Paradise, Inc. which accounted for 38% of total net sales to unaffiliated customers decreased by
5.6% to net sales of $5,306,706 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5,622,810 for the similar
reporting period of 2015. While sales to customers of vacuum forming plastics parts within the housing market increased by 5%
for the current reporting period over the similar reporting period of 2015, it was not enough net revenue to offset a recent
decline in sales related to a long term customer within the Company s thermoforming operations. As mentioned in
previous filings, Paradise Plastics, Inc. produces various types of custom molded plastics for its customers which are then
assembled into finished products by its customers. Thus, changes in demand for these finish products by the end user will
have a direct impact on our sales. As of the date of filing, management is not able to predict whether the recent decline in
sales will continue. 

Consolidated cost of sales as a
percentage of overall net sales decreased 6.0% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the similar reporting period of 2015.
This is less than the 10.4% decrease in cost of sales reported during the June 30, 2016 filing, however, this decrease is still
due to the following two reasons. First, a greater percentage of vacuum forming plastics parts ordered and shipped during the first
nine months of 2016 vs. 2015 were of higher gross margins. Secondly, the fruit segment, after not commencing brining operations
of orange peel during the first nine months of 2015, produced 2.9 million lbs. of brined orange peel inventory during the first
nine months of 2016. With more than an adequate amount of brined orange peel in the Company s inventory as of January 1,
2015, brining operations for orange peel were postponed for 2015. Thus, the increase in orange peel production during the first
nine months of 2016 allocated over a relatively fixed amount of factory overhead (i.e.: insurance, utilities, depreciation and
taxes) had the impact of reducing cost of sales as of September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015. However, it is important
to understand that until a full year s production cycle is completed, the Company will not be able to determine to what extent
the additional production mentioned above will have on cost of sales as it relates to overall sales. 

Inventory as of September 30, 2016
totaled $11,997,652 compared to $11,434,903 as of September 30, 2015 representing an increase of $562,749. This represents an increase
of 4.9% and is attributable to the increased orange peel production discussed in the cost of sales section above. 

Selling, general   administrative
expenses for the first nine months of 2016 totaled $2,774,766 compared to $2,979,115 representing a decrease of $204,349 or 6.9%
and is primarily related to the retirement of three senior managers during late 2015. 

PART I.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  

The First Nine Months (Continued)   

Paradise, Inc. finances ongoing
operations primarily with cash provided by our operating activities which are seasonal in nature. Our principal sources of liquidity
are our cash flows provided by operating activities, our existing cash, and a line of credit facility. At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, we had $1,138,700 and $8,791,938, respectively, in cash. Additionally, we have a revolving line of credit with
a maximum limit of $12 million and a borrowing limit of 80% of the Company s eligible receivables plus up to 60% of the Company s
eligible inventory, of which $0 was outstanding at September 30, 2016 and $0 at December 31, 2015. Within this agreement, there
are letters of credit with a limit of $1,750,000, of which $291,838 was outstanding at September 30, 2016 and $582,839 December
31, 2015. The line of credit agreement expires in July, 2017. Net cash decreased by $7,653,238 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $6,458,430 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The primary reason for this decrease in cash for
the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015 was the earlier repayment of short-term debt of just over $1.0 million as of September
30, 2016. 

Summary   

Paradise Inc. s
consolidated net sales decreased slightly to $13,950,369 for the first nine months of 2016 compared to $14,032,757 for the
first nine months of 2015 as an increase in the earlier shipment of the Company s holiday segment fruit segments
products was offset by a downturn in thermoforming plastics parts during the third quarter of 2016. However, as mentioned and
disclosed in all previous interim filings, due to the highly seasonal nature of the Company s primary revenue source,
glace  fruit sales, no meaningful financial analysis can be developed from Paradise, Inc. s interim reporting
results. Only a full year s accounting of revenue and expenses will provide the necessary information to determine the
Company s overall financial performance. 

Critical Accounting Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make assessments, estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used
to prepare the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis. Critical accounting estimates are those that require management s
most difficult, complex, or subjective judgments and have the most potential to impact our financial position and operating results.
For a detailed discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

In November 2015,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740) Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which simplifies
the presentation of deferred income taxes. The ASU provides presentation requirements to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities
as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for any interim and annual financial statements that
have not yet been issued. The new guidance may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively
to all periods presented. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)(ASU 2016-02).  Under ASU No. 2016-2, an entity will
be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information
about leasing arrangements. ASU No. 2016-02 offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and
leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about
leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows
arising from leases. For public companies, ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with

PART I.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure and Market
Risk   N/A  

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures  

As of September 30, 2016, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures,
and they have concluded that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. There were no significant changes in
our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Disclosure controls and procedures
mean the methods designed to ensure that information that the Company is required to disclose in the reports that it files with
the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required. Our controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management
to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. Our controls and procedures are also designed to provide reasonable assurance of
the reliability of our financial reporting and accurate recording of our financial transactions. 

A control system, however well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. There
are inherent limitations in all control systems, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
gaps or instances of fraud have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that the judgments in decision-making
can be faulty, and that simple errors or mistakes can occur.

role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
