1.    Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cascade Bancorp ( Bancorp ), an Oregon-chartered single bank holding company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bank of the Cascades (the  Bank ) (collectively, the  Company  or  Cascade ). All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, certain financial information and footnotes have been omitted or condensed. In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (all of which are of a normal and recurring nature) necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and income and expenses for the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Operating results for the interim periods disclosed herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year or any future period. 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015   were derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statements, but do not include all disclosures contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  2015 Annual Report ). The interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the   December 31, 2015   consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in the 2015 Annual Report. 

2.    Business Combinations 
    
  Prime Pacific Financial Services, Inc. 
  At close of business on August 1, 2016, (the "PPFS Acquisition Date ), the Company acquired Prime Pacific Financial Services, Inc. ( PPFS ), the holding company of Prime Pacific Bank, National Association, a Snohomish county, national banking association.   
    
  The merger was completed following the approval of PPFS shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals. 
    
  Each share of PPFS common stock was converted into the right to receive   0.3050   shares of Cascade common stock.  The conversion resulted in Cascade issuing   2,921,012   shares of its common stock.   
    
  The merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date.  Preliminary goodwill of   $2.2 million   was calculated as the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired and represents the value expected from the synergies created and the economies of scale expected from combining the two banking organizations.  
    
  In most instances, determining the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities required us to estimate cash flows expected to result from those assets and liabilities and to discount those cash flows at appropriate rates of interest. The most significant of those determinations relates to the valuation of acquired loans. For such loans, the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is recognized as interest income over the remaining lives of the loans. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition reflects the impact of estimated credit losses and other factors, such as prepayments. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for business combinations, there was no carry-over of PPFS s previously established reserve for loan losses. 
    
  The following table provides a summary of the purchase price calculation as of the PPFS Acquisition Date and the identifiable assets purchased and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values.  These fair value measurements are provisional based on third-party valuations that are currently under review and are subject to refinement for up to one year after the PPFS Acquisition Date based on additional information that may be obtained by us that existed as of the PPFS Acquisition Date.

PPFS acquisition-related charges of   $1.2 million   and   $1.3 million   were recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Such expenses were for human resources and professional services, among other categories, and include investment banker fees, legal and accounting support, as well as severance, IT and certain branch consolidation items. 
    
  The following table provides the unaudited pro forma information for the results of operations for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015.   These adjustments reflect the impact of certain purchase accounting fair value measurements, primarily comprised of PPFS s loan and deposit portfolios. In addition, the   $1.3 million   in acquisition-related expenses noted earlier are included in the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . These unaudited pro forma results are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to represent or be indicative of the actual results of operations of the combined banking organization that would have been achieved had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of each period presented, nor are they intended to represent or be indicative of future results of operations.

Bank of America, National Association branches  
  On   March 4, 2016  , the Bank completed the acquisition of   twelve   Oregon branch locations and   three   Washington branch locations from Bank of America, National Association (the  branch acquisition ). This transaction allowed Cascade the opportunity to enhance and strengthen its footprint in Oregon, while providing entry into the Washington market.  The Bank assumed approximately   $469.9 million   of branch deposits, paying a   2.00%   premium on the average balance of deposits assumed, for a cash purchase price of   $9.7 million  .  
    
  The following is a condensed balance sheet disclosing the estimated fair value amounts of the branches acquired in the branch acquisition assigned to the major consolidated asset and liability captions at the acquisition date (dollars in thousands): 

The core deposit intangible asset recognized as part of the branch acquisition will be amortized over its estimated useful life of approximately   10   years. 
    
  The fair value of demand deposit accounts assumed from the branch acquisition approximated the carrying value as checking and savings accounts have no stated maturity and are payable on demand.  Certificates of deposit were valued by comparing the contractual cost of the portfolio to a similar portfolio bearing current market rates. 
    
  Direct costs related to the branch acquisition were expensed as incurred in the quarter ended   March 31, 2016  . Such expenses primarily related to professional and legal services, human resource costs and information system charges.  For the quarter ended   March 31, 2016  , the Company incurred   $2.3 million   of expenses related to the branch acquisition.  
    
  Pro forma income statements are not being presented as the information is not practicable to produce.

The unrealized losses on investments in U.S. Agency and non-agency MBS and U.S. Agency asset-backed securities are primarily due to changes in market yield/rate spreads at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   as compared to yield/rate spread relationships prevailing at the time specific investment securities were purchased. The Company had   38   and   46   securities in the loss position at    September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Management expects the fair value of these investment securities to recover as securities approach their maturity dates. Management does not believe that the above gross unrealized losses on investment securities are other-than-temporary. Accordingly, no impairment adjustments have been recorded. 
    
  Management intends to hold the investment securities classified as held-to-maturity until they mature, at which time the Company will receive full amortized cost value for such investment securities. Furthermore, as of   September 30, 2016  , management did not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as held-to-maturity in the table above and believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. 

4.        Loans and reserve for credit losses 
    
   The composition of the loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows (dollars in thousands):

The following describes the distinction between originated and acquired loan portfolios and certain significant accounting policies relevant to each of these portfolios. 
    
  Originated loans 
    
  Loans originated for investment are stated at their principal amount outstanding adjusted for partial charge-offs, the reserve for loan losses and net deferred loan fees and costs. Interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans. Interest is not accrued on loans where collectability is uncertain. Accrued interest on loans is presented in  Other assets  on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Loan origination fees and certain direct costs incurred to extend credit are deferred and amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to the related loan yield.  
    
  Approximately   76.1%   of the Bank s originated loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016   consisted of real estate-related loans, including construction and development loans, residential mortgage loans, and commercial loans secured by commercial real estate. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   78.2%   of the Bank s total portfolio (inclusive of acquired loans) consisted of real estate-related loans as described above. The Bank s results of operations and financial condition are affected by general economic trends and in particular, the strength of the local residential and commercial real estate markets in Central, Southern and Northwest Oregon, as well as the greater Boise/Treasure Valley, Idaho and Seattle, Washington metro areas. Real estate values could be affected by, among other things, a worsening of national and local economic conditions, an increase in foreclosures, a decline in home sale volumes, and an increase in interest rates. Furthermore, the Bank may experience an increase in the number of borrowers who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to the Bank in the event of a sustained downturn in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which the Bank does business. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults could result in a higher level of non-performing assets, net charge-offs, and loan loss provision. Management expects to diversify its commercial real estate ( CRE ) concentration over time, but real estate-related loans will remain a significant portfolio component due to the nature of the economies, businesses, and markets the Bank serves. 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Bank may participate portions of loans to third parties in order to extend the Bank s lending capability or to mitigate risk. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the portion of loans participated to third parties (which are not included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) totaled   $50.7 million   and   $44.2 million  , respectively. 
    
  Acquired loans 
    
  PPFS 
  Acquired loans include those loans purchased by the Company in its acquisition of PPFS, which was completed on   August 1, 2016  .  These loans were recorded at estimated fair value at the PPFS Acquisition Date. The fair value estimates for acquired loans are based on expected prepayments, charge-offs and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows. The net fair value adjustment to the PPFS acquired loans at acquisition was a reduction of   $2.3 million  , representing  
  
   14 

    Cascade Bancorp   Subsidiary 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  September 30, 2016 
  (unaudited) 

a valuation adjustment for interest rate and credit which will be accreted over the life of the loans (approximately   10   years).  As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining net fair value adjustment to the PPFS acquired loans was   $2.3 million  . 
    
  Home 
  Acquired loans also include those loans purchased by the Company in its acquisition of Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. ( Home ), which was completed on   May 16, 2014   (the  Home Acquisition Date ).  These loans were recorded at estimated fair value at the Home Acquisition Date. The fair value estimates for acquired loans are based on expected prepayments, charge-offs and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows. The net fair value adjustment to the Home acquired loans at acquisition was a reduction of $  6.0 million  , representing a valuation adjustment for interest rate and credit which will be accreted over the life of the loans (approximately   10   years).  As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining net fair value adjustment was   $1.9 million  . 
    
  Of the PPFS and Home loans acquired on the PPFS Acquisition Date and Home Acquisition Date, as applicable, and still held at   September 30, 2016  ,   $9.8 million  , or   3.3%  , were graded substandard.  With the amount of classified loans acquired being nominal, all loans acquired are treated in a manner consistent with originated loans for credit risk management and accounting purposes.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $22.3 million  , or   7.5%   of the $  298.8 million   in acquired loans were covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC ( covered loans ) that were entered into in September 2009 and September 2010 between the FDIC and Home. The loss sharing agreements have limited terms (  10 years   for net losses on single-family residential real estate loans, as defined by the FDIC,   five years   for losses on non-residential real estate loans, as defined by the FDIC, and an additional   three years   with respect to recoveries on non-residential real estate loans). After the expiration of the loss sharing agreements, the Company will not be indemnified for losses and related expenses on covered loans. When the loss sharing agreements expire, the Company s and the Bank s risk-based capital ratios will be reduced. While the agreements are in place, the covered loans receive a   20%   risk-weighting. When the agreements expire, the risk-weighting for previously covered loans will most likely increase to   100%  , based on current regulatory capital definitions. Nearly all of the assets remaining in the covered loans portfolio are non-single family covered loans. Therefore, most of the covered loans were no longer indemnified after September 30, 2014 or were no longer indemnified after September 30, 2015.  With the amount of classified loans covered under these agreements being nominal, amounts that may be due to or due from the FDIC under loss sharing agreements will be accounted for on a cash basis. 
    
  A net loss share payable was recorded at the Home Acquisition Date that represents the estimated value of reimbursement the Company expects to pay to the FDIC for recoveries net of incurred losses on covered loans. These expected reimbursements are recorded as part of covered loans in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Upon the determination of an incurred loss or recovery, the loss share receivable/payable will be changed by the amount due to or due from the FDIC.  
    
  Changes in the loss share payable associated with cov  ered loans for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows (dollars in thousands)  : 

Reserve for loan losses 
    
  The reserve for loan losses represents management s estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio as of the condensed consolidated balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The reserve for loan losses is increased by charges to operating expense through the loan loss provision, and decreased by loans charged-off, net of recoveries. The reserve for loan losses requires complex subjective judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are uncertain. The reserve  
  
   15 

    Cascade Bancorp   Subsidiary 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  September 30, 2016 
  (unaudited) 

for loan losses is maintained at a level currently considered adequate to provide for potential loan losses based on management s assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio.  
    
  However, the reserve for loan losses is based on estimates and actual losses may vary from the current estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known. Therefore, management cannot provide assurance that, in any particular period, the Company will not have significant losses in relation to the amount reserved. The level of the reserve for loan losses is also determined after consideration of bank regulatory guidance and recommendations and is subject to review by such regulatory authorities who may require increases or decreases to the reserve based on their evaluation of the information available to them at the time of their examinations of the Bank. 
    
  For purposes of assessing the appropriate level of the reserve for loan losses, the Company analyzes loans and commitments to loan, and the amount of reserves allocated to loans and commitments to loan in each of the following reserve categories: pooled reserves, specifically identified reserves for impaired loans, and the unallocated reserve. Also, for purposes of analyzing loan portfolio credit quality and determining the appropriate level of reserve for loan losses, the Company identifies loan portfolio segments and classes based on the nature of the underlying loan collateral. 
    
  Risk ratings for individual shared national credits ( SNC ) are estimated using analysis of both public debt ratings and internal ratings. Expected loss rates are determined based upon historical published specific loss data for similar loans based on average losses and losses stratified by public debt ratings. Public ratings combined with internal risk rates are used to determine a minimum historical loss factor for each SNC loan. This amount may be increased for qualitative conditions including macroeconomic environment and observations by the Company s SNC management group.  The SNC lending strategy is intended to diversify the Company s credit risk profile geographically and by industry.  Additionally, such loans enhance the Company s interest rate risk profile as they float with LIBOR rates.  
    
  The increase in the reserve for loan losses from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was related to net recoveries and loan portfolio growth during the period. Management believes the amount of ALLL is appropriate as of   September 30, 2016  . The unallocated reserve for loan losses at   September 30, 2016   has decreased $  0.6 million   from the balance at   December 31, 2015  . Management believes that the amount of unallocated reserve for loan losses is appropriate and will continue to evaluate the amount going forward. 
    
  Acquired reserve for loan losses 
    
  The fair value estimates for acquired loans are based on expected prepayments, charge-offs, and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows. The net fair value adjustment to the acquired loans was $  6.0 million   and   $2.3 million   for Home and PPFS, respectively, at the time of acquisition representing a valuation adjustment for interest rate and credit quality. The credit portion of the fair value adjustment not accreted at any point in time represents the estimated reserve for loan losses for acquired loans. If the Company determines that this amount is insufficient, a provision to the reserve for loan losses will be made. As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining net fair value adjustment was   $1.9 million   and   $2.3 million   for Home and PPFS, respectively, and no additional reserve for acquired loans was required.

An individual loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, management believes that it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The following table presents the reserve for loan losses and the recorded investment in loans by portfolio segment and impairment evaluation method at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

The above reserve for loan losses includes an unallocated allowance of $  1.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and $  2.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The change in the unallocated allowance is due to the increase in qualitative factors impacting the reserve, partially offset by net recoveries. 
    
  The Company uses credit risk ratings, which reflect the Bank s assessment of a loan s risk or loss potential, for purposes of assessing the appropriate level of reserve for loan losses. The Bank s credit risk rating definitions along with applicable borrower characteristics for each credit risk rating are as follows: 
    
  Acceptable 
    
  The borrower is a reasonable credit risk and demonstrates the ability to repay the loan from normal business operations. Loans are generally made to companies operating in an economy and/or industry that is generally sound. The borrower tends to operate in regional or local markets and has achieved sufficient revenues for the business to be financially viable. The borrowers financial performance has been consistent in normal economic times and has been average or better than average for its industry. 
    
  A loan can also be considered Acceptable even though the borrower may have some vulnerability to downturns in the economy due to marginally satisfactory working capital and debt service cushion. Availability of alternate financing sources may be limited or nonexistent. In some cases, the borrower s management may have limited depth or continuity but is still considered capable. An adequate primary source of repayment is identified while secondary sources may be illiquid, more speculative, less readily identified, or reliant upon collateral liquidation. Loan agreements will be well defined, including several financial performance covenants and detailed operating covenants. This category also includes commercial loans to individuals with average or better than average capacity to repay.

Pass-Watch 
    
  Loans are graded Pass-Watch when temporary situations increase the level of the Bank s risk associated with the loan, and remain graded Pass-Watch until the situation has been corrected. These situations may involve one or more weaknesses in cash flow, collateral value or indebtedness that could, if not corrected within a reasonable period of time, jeopardize the full repayment of the debt. In general, loans in this category remain adequately protected by the borrower s net worth and paying capacity, or pledged collateral. 
    
  Special Mention 
    
  A Special Mention credit has potential weaknesses that may, if not checked or corrected, weaken the loan or leave the Bank inadequately protected at some future date. Loans in this category are deemed by management of the Bank to be currently protected but reflect potential problems that warrant more than the usual management attention but do not justify a Substandard classification. 
    
  Substandard 
    
  Substandard loans are those inadequately protected by the net worth and paying capacity of the obligor and/or by the value of the pledged collateral, if any. Substandard loans have a high probability of payment default or they have other well-defined weaknesses. They require more intensive supervision and borrowers are generally characterized by current or expected unprofitable operations, inadequate debt service coverage, inadequate liquidity, or marginal capitalization. Repayment may depend on collateral or other credit risk mitigants. 
    
  CRE and construction loans are classified Substandard when well-defined weaknesses are present which jeopardize the orderly liquidation of the loan. Well-defined weaknesses include a project s lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time, and/or the project s failure to fulfill economic expectations. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
    
  Substandard loans also include impaired loans. Impaired loans bear the characteristics of Substandard loans as described above, and the Company has determined it does not expect timely payment of all contractually due interest and principal. Impaired loans may be adequately secured by collateral. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Bank saw relatively steady credit quality metrics.  An improvement in Special Mention loans was partially offset by an increase in the Substandard portfolio. Increases in the Substandard loan balances were largely due to certain energy/mining sector SNCs included in commercial and industrial ( C I ) loans.  Aggregate portfolio exposure to the energy/mining sector is less than   1%   of total loans outstanding.

Interest income recognized for cash payments received on impaired loans for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.5 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. 
    
  Information with respect to the Company s non-performing loans, by portfolio class, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows (dollars in thousands): 

TDRs 
    
  The Company allocated   no   specific reserves to customers whose loan terms had been modified in TDRs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . TDRs involve the restructuring of loan terms to allow customers to mitigate the risk of foreclosure by meeting a lower loan payment requirement based upon their current cash flow. As indicated above, TDRs may also include loans to borrowers experiencing financial distress that renewed at existing contractual rates, but below market rates for comparable credit quality. The Company has been actively utilizing these programs and working with its customers to improve obligor cash flow and related prospects for repayment. Concessions may include, but are not limited to, interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness, deferral of interest payments, extension of the maturity date, and other actions intended to minimize potential losses to the Company. For each commercial loan restructuring, a comprehensive credit underwriting analysis of the borrower s financial condition and prospects of repayment under the revised terms is performed to assess whether the new structure can be successful and whether cash flows will be sufficient to support the restructured debt. Generally, if the loan is on accrual status at the time of restructuring, it will remain on accrual status after the restructuring. After   six   consecutive payments under the restructured terms, a non-accrual restructured loan is reviewed for possible upgrade to accrual status. 
    
  Typically, once a loan is identified as a TDR it will retain that designation until it is paid off, because restructured loans generally are not at market rates following restructuring. Under certain circumstances, a TDR may be removed from TDR status if it is determined to no longer be impaired and the loan is at a competitive interest rate. Under such circumstances, allowance allocations for loans removed from TDR status would be based on the historical allocation for the applicable loan grade and loan class. 
    
  There were no loans modified and recorded as TDRs during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
    
  The following table presents, by portfolio segment, the information with respect to the Company s loans that were modified and recorded as TDRs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands).

7.     Goodwill and other intangible assets 
    
  At close of business on   August 1, 2016  , the Company completed the PPFS acquisition.  The Company recorded   $2.2 million   of goodwill in connection with the PPFS acquisition. 
    
  On   March 4, 2016  , the Bank completed the branch acquisition. The Company recorded   $4.0 million   of goodwill in connection with the branch acquisition.  
    
  The Company recorded   $78.6 million   of goodwill in connection with the acquisition of Home in 2014.  In accordance with the Intangibles - Goodwill and Other topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC, goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level. Management analyzes its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, such as upon material adverse changes in legal, business, regulatory and economic factors. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The Company performed an impairment assessment as of December 31, 2015 and concluded that there was no impairment to goodwill.  
    
  Core deposit intangibles ( CDI ) are evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment. The CDI are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated life of   10   years. The following table sets forth activity for CDI for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands).  

The following table provides the estimated future amortization expense of CDI for the remaining period ending   December 31, 2016   and the succeeding four years (dollars in thousands):

8.    Basic and Diluted Net Income per Share 
    
  The Company s basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company s diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus any incremental shares arising from the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation. 
    
  The numerators and denominators used in computing basic and diluted net income per common share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   can be reconciled as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data): 

9.    Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   1,621,245   shares reserved under the Company s stock-based compensation plans were available for future grants. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   678,051   shares of restricted stock, which vest between   2016   and   2021  , were granted with a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $5.69  . During the same period, the Company converted existing PPFS stock options into   14,222   Cascade Bancorp stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of   $3.71   per share, of which 100% were vested upon conversion. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company granted   397,472   shares of restricted stock, which vest between 2016 and 2020, with a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $4.98   per share. During the same period,   3,300,000   stock options, which vest over a   three   to   five   year period, were granted. The Company used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions to value options that were granted in   2015  :  

The dividend yield was based on historical dividend information. The Company has not paid dividends since the third quarter of 2008 resulting in the dividend yield of   0.0%  . The expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock price as adjusted for certain historical periods of extraordinary volatility in order to provide a basis for a reasonable estimate of fair value. Periods that were determined to be extraordinary were replaced with the mean volatility of like publicly-traded community banks in the western U.S.  Over time, identified periods of extraordinary volatility will recede and will be replaced with the Company s actual historical volatility.  The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected lives of the options granted. The expected option lives

represent the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding, giving consideration to vesting schedules and historical exercise and forfeiture patterns. 
    
  The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly-traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.  The Black-Scholes model is affected by subjective assumptions, including historical volatility of the Company s common stock price.   
    
  The following table presents the activity related to stock options for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $0.8 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $3.6 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options that will be recognized over the remaining vesting periods of the stock options. 
    
  The following table presents the activity related to non-vested restricted stock for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

Non-vested restricted stock is scheduled to vest over a   three   to   five   year period.   The unearned compensation on restricted stock is being amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated applicable service or vesting periods. As of   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock totaled approximately   $5.5 million  , which is expected to be recognized over the next five years. Total expense recognized by the Company for non-vested restricted stock for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.5 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively. There was   $0.3 million   unrecognized

compensation cost related to restricted stock units ( RSUs ) at   September 30, 2016   and   no   unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs at   December 31, 2015  .  

10.      Interest Rate Swap Derivatives 
    
  Derivative instruments are contracts between two or more parties that have a notional amount and an underlying variable, require no net investment and allow for the net settlement of positions. The notional amount serves as the basis for the payment provision of the contract and takes the form of units, such as shares or dollars. The underlying variable represents a specified interest rate, index, or other component. The interaction between the notional amount and the underlying variable determines the number of units to be exchanged between the parties and influences the market value of the derivative contract. The Company obtains dealer quotation to value its derivative contracts.  
    
  The Company periodically enters into certain commercial loan interest rate swap agreements in order to provide commercial loan customers the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rates.  Under these agreements, the Company provides the customer with a variable rate loan and enters into an interest rate swap in which the customer receives a variable rate payment in exchange for a fixed rate payment. The Company offsets its risk exposure by entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with a dealer counterparty for the same notional amount and length of term as the customer interest rate swap providing the dealer counterparty with a fixed rate payment in exchange for a variable rate payment.  Generally, these instruments help the Company manage exposure to market risk and meet customer financing needs. Market risk represents the possibility that economic value or net interest income will be adversely affected by fluctuations in external factors such as market-driven interest rates and prices or other economic factors.  
    
  The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to these agreements. Credit risk of the financial contract is controlled through the credit approval, limits, and monitoring procedures and management does not expect the counterparties to fail their obligations. 
    
  In connection with the interest rate swaps between the Company and the dealer counterparties, the agreements contain a provision that if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations. Similarly, the Company could be required to settle its obligations under certain of its agreements if certain credit ratings fall below specified standards or if specific regulatory events occur, such as a publicly issued memorandum of understanding, cease and desist order, or a termination of insurance coverage by the FDIC.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the notional values or contractual amounts and fair values of the Company s derivatives not designated in hedge relationships were as follows (dollars in thousands):   

Swap fee income, as included in non-interest income, was   $0.7 million   and   $1.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $0.6 million   and   $1.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  The Company generally posts collateral against derivative liabilities in the form of cash. Collateral posted against derivative liabilities was   $19.5 million   and   $8.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Derivative assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and do not take into account the effects of master netting agreements. Master netting agreements allow the Company to settle all derivative contracts held with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset net derivative position with related collateral where applicable.  
    
  The following table illustrates the potential effect of the Company s derivative master netting arrangements, by type of financial instrument, on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands):

  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets ( DTA ), management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTA will or will not be realized. The Company s ultimate realization of the DTA is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the nature and amount of historical and projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables. 
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a   $2.4 million   and   $6.4 million   income tax provision, respectively.    During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded a   $2.6 million   and   $8.6 million   income tax provision, respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the net DTA was   $46.2 million   compared with a net DTA of   $50.7 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  During the third quarter and first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , the Company s current taxes consisted of federal and state alternative minimum taxes and other state minimum taxes. The Company s estimated effective income tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to the exclusion of certain BOLI and municipal bond interest income from taxable income.

12.    Fair Value Measurements 
    
  GAAP establishes a hierarchy for determining fair value measurements that includes three levels and is based upon the valuation techniques used to measure assets and liabilities. The three levels are as follows: 

Level 1  : Inputs that are quoted unadjusted prices in active markets - that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date - for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2:   Inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3:   Inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. 
       
  A description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. These valuation methodologies were applied to all of the Company s assets and liabilities carried at fair value. Where available, fair value is based upon quoted market prices. Significant balances of the Bank s financial assets and liabilities do not have quoted market prices. In such circumstances, fair value is based upon internal or third party models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters, such as yields and discount rates of comparable instruments of like duration or credit quality. Valuation adjustments may be made to model results with respect to various assets or liabilities. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Company s creditworthiness, among other things, as well as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time. The Company s valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While management believes that the Company s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain assets and liabilities could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Furthermore, the reported fair value amounts have not been comprehensively revalued since the presentation dates, and, therefore, estimates of fair value after the condensed consolidated balance sheet date may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. 
    
  The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to valuation hierarchy: 
    
  Investment securities available-for-sale  : Where quoted prices for identical assets are available in an active market, investment securities available-for-sale are classified within level 1 of the hierarchy. If quoted market prices for identical securities are not available, then fair values are estimated by independent sources using pricing models and/or quoted prices of investment securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. The Company has categorized its investment securities available-for-sale as level 2, since a majority of such securities are MBS which are mainly priced in this latter manner. 
    
  Interest rate swap derivatives  : The fair value of the interest rate lock commitments and forward sales commitments are estimated using quoted or published market prices for similar instruments, adjusted for factors such as pull-through rate assumptions based on historical information, where appropriate.  The fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow technique with values provided by third party swap dealers or consultants. The Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its interest rate swap derivatives fall within Level 2. 
    
  Impaired loans  : In accordance with GAAP, loans are measured for impairment using one of three methods: an observable market price (if available), the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, or at the fair value of the loan s collateral (if collateral dependent). Estimated fair value of the loan s collateral is determined by appraisals or independent valuations which are then adjusted for the estimated costs related to liquidation of the collateral. Management s ongoing review of appraisal information may result in additional discounts or adjustments to valuation based upon more recent

market sales activity or more current appraisal information derived from properties of similar type and/or locale. A significant portion of the Bank s impaired loans are measured using the estimated fair market value of the collateral less the estimated costs to sell. The Company has categorized all its loans impaired during the calendar year utilizing fair value metrics as level 3. Loans that were impaired during the calendar year based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans  effective interest rates are not included in the table below as the loans  effective interest rates are not based on current market rates. 
    
  OREO  : The Company s OREO is measured at estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is generally determined based on third-party appraisals of fair value in an orderly sale. Historically, appraisals have considered comparable sales of like assets in reaching a conclusion as to fair value. Since many recent real estate sales could be termed  distressed sales , and since a preponderance have been short-sale or foreclosure related, this has directly impacted appraisal valuation estimates. Estimated costs to sell OREO are based on standard market factors. The valuation of OREO is subject to significant external and internal judgment. Management periodically reviews OREO to determine whether the property continues to be carried at the lower of its recorded book value or estimated fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. The Company has categorized its OREO as level 3. 
    
  The Company s only financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (e.g., the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments when there is evidence of impairment). The following table represents the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis by the Company at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands):

The Company did not change the methodology used to determine fair value for any assets or liabilities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   or during   2015  . In addition, for any given class of assets, the Company did not have any transfers between level 1, level 2, or level 3 during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   or during   2015  . 
    
  The following disclosures are made in accordance with the provisions of GAAP, which requires the disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments where it is practicable to estimate that value. 
    
  In cases where quoted market values are not available, the Company primarily uses present value techniques to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments. Valuation methods require considerable judgment, and the resulting estimates of fair value can be significantly affected by the assumptions made and methods used. Accordingly, the estimates provided herein do not necessarily indicate amounts which could be realized in a current market exchange. 
    
  In addition, as the Company normally intends to hold the majority of its financial instruments until maturity, it does not expect to realize many of the estimated amounts disclosed. The disclosures also do not include estimated fair value amounts for items which are not defined as financial instruments but which may have significant value. The Company does not believe that it would be practicable to estimate a representational fair value for these types of items as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Because GAAP excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements, any aggregation of the fair value amounts presented would not represent the underlying value of the Company. 
    
  The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments: 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents  :  The carrying amount approximates the estimated fair value of these instruments. 
    
  Investment securities  : See above description. 
    
  FHLB stock  :  The carrying amount approximates the estimated fair value of this investment. 
    
  Loans  :  The estimated fair value of non-impaired loans is calculated by discounting the contractual cash flows of the loans using   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   origination rates. The resulting amounts are adjusted to estimate the effect of changes in the credit quality of borrowers since the loans were originated. Estimated fair values for impaired loans are determined using an observable market price (if available) or the fair value of the loan s collateral (if collateral dependent) as described above. Observable market prices for community bank loans are not generally available given the non-homogenous characteristics of such loans.

BOLI  : The carrying amount of both the separate and general account BOLI approximates the estimated fair value of these instruments.  Fair values of insurance policies owned are based on the insurance contracts  cash surrender values. 
    
  MSRs  : The estimated fair value of MSRs is calculated by discounting the expected future contractual cash flows. Factors considered in the estimated fair value calculation include prepayment speed forecasts, market discount rates, earning rates, servicing costs, acquisition costs, ancillary income, and borrower rates. 
    
  Deposits  :  The estimated fair value of demand deposits, consisting of checking, interest bearing demand, and savings deposit accounts, is represented by the amounts payable on demand. At the reporting date, the estimated fair value of time deposits is calculated by discounting the scheduled cash flows using the   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   rates offered on those instruments. 
    
  Other borrowings:   The fair value of other borrowings (including federal funds purchased, if any) is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on the Bank s   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. 
    
  Loan commitments and standby letters of credit  : The majority of the Bank s commitments to extend credit have variable interest rates and  escape  clauses if the customer s credit quality deteriorates. Therefore, the fair values of these items are not significant and are not included in the following table. 
    
  The estimated fair values of the Company s significant on-balance sheet financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were approximately as follows (dollars in thousands): 

13.      Regulatory Matters 
    
  Bancorp and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, Bancorp and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory

accounting practices. Bancorp s and the Bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
    
  Quantitative measures established by regulation to provide for capital adequacy require Bancorp and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the tables below) of Tier 1 capital to average assets, common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ( CET1 ), and Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets (all as defined in the regulations). 
    
  Federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements. Such actions could potentially include a leverage capital limit, a risk-based capital requirement, and any other measure of capital deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulator for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution. In addition, payment of dividends by Bancorp and the Bank are subject to restriction by state and federal regulators and availability of retained earnings. 
    
  In July 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks ( Basel III ). Under the final rules, which became effective for the Bancorp and the Bank on January 1, 2015 and are subject to a phase-in period through January 1, 2019, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Bancorp and the Bank. The rules include a CET1ratio of   4.5%   and a capital conservation buffer of   2.5%   above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements, which when fully phased-in, effectively results in a minimum CET1 ratio of   7.0%  . Basel III also (i) raises the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from   4.0%   to   6.0%   (which, with the capital conservation buffer, effectively results in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of   8.5%   when fully phased-in), (ii) effectively results in a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of   10.5%   (with the capital conservation buffer fully phased-in), and (iii) requires a minimum leverage ratio of   4.0%  . Basel III also makes changes to risk weights for certain assets and off-balance-sheet exposures.  
    
  Bancorp s and Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios and the required capital ratios under the prompt corrective action framework as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are presented in the following table (dollars in thousands):

14.      Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.  While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

15.      New Authoritative Accounting Guidance 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  " ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 addresses the classification of debt prepayment or debt extinguishment

costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance policies, including Bank-Owned Life Insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "  Financial Instruments- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  " ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 requires financial assets that are measured at amortized cost to be presented as the net amount expected to be collected.  The income statement will reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets and for the expected increase or decrease of expected credit losses.  ASU 2016-13 notes that credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The initial allowance for credit losses, for purchased available-for-sale securities, is added to the purchase price rather than reported as a credit loss expense.  Subsequent changes in the allowance are recorded as credit loss expense.  Interest income should be recognized based on the effective interest rate, excluding the discount attributed to the assessment of credit loss at acquisition. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting    (     ASU 2016-09     ).  ASU 2016-09 describes simplifications related to accounting and presenting share-based payment awards.  ASU 2016-09 states that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement; excess tax benefits should be classified with other income tax as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows; an entity may make an entity-wide accounting policy to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur; and cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Adoption of ASU 2016-09 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases    ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,    Financial Instruments- Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities    ( ASU 2016-01 ). ASU 2016-01 simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments, clarifies reporting disclosure requirements for financial instruments measured at amortized cost, and requires the exit price notion be disclosed when measuring fair value of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 details the required separate presentation in other comprehensive income for the change in fair value of a liability related to change in instrument specific credit risk and details the required separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category, and clarifies the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to available-for-sale securities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,    Interest- Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs    ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs and requires that the debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance of debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of ASU 2015-03 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers    ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 establishes a comprehensive revenue recognition standard for virtually all industries under U.S. GAAP, including those that previously followed industry-specific guidance such as the real estate, construction and software industries. The revenue standard s core principle is built on the contract between a vendor and a customer for the provision of goods and services. It attempts to depict the exchange of rights and obligations between the parties in the pattern of revenue recognition based on the consideration to which the vendor is entitled. To accomplish this objective, the standard requires five basic steps: i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with three transition methods available - full retrospective, retrospective and cumulative effect approach. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date  ( ASU 2015-14 ). ASU 2015-14 amended the effective date to December 15, 2017. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal Versus Agent Considerations  ( ASU 2016-08 ).  ASU 2016-08 defines the roles of a principal and agent in revenue recognition and determines when control of the good or service is transferred to the customer.   In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ).  ASU 2016-10 establishes guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow- Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients" ( ASU 2016-12 ).  ASU 2016-12 clarifies the objective of the collectability criteria and notes the differences in applying the update at transition and on an ongoing basis. Adoption of ASU 2014-09, ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, and ASU 2016-12 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 
    
  Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in our 2015 Annual Report. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends, and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows. 
  Reserve for Credit Losses 
  The Company s reserve for credit losses provides for estimated losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and related loan commitments. Arriving at an estimate of the appropriate level of reserve for credit losses (which consists of the Company s reserve for loan losses and reserve for loan commitments) involves a high degree of judgment and assessment of multiple variables that result in a methodology with relatively complex calculations and analysis. Management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses and considers qualitative factors, including national and local macroeconomic conditions, real estate market behavior and a range of other factors, in its determination of the reserve.  
  
   44 

On an ongoing basis, the Company seeks to enhance and refine its methodology such that the reserve is at an appropriate level and responsive to changing conditions.  
  The reserve for loan losses is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged-off and reduced by loans charged-off. The reserve for loan commitments is increased and decreased through non-interest expense. For a full discussion of the Company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses, see    Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality    in Item 7 of our 2015 Annual Report. 
  Deferred Income Taxes  
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision (credit) for income taxes. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the expected amount to be realized.  
  Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management s judgment that realization is  more likely than not.  Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. We account for interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.   
  The Company reversed its deferred tax asset ( DTA ) valuation allowance as of June 30, 2013 due to management s determination that it was more likely than not that a significant portion of the Company s DTA would be realized. Management s determination resulted from consideration of both the positive and negative evidence available that can be objectively verified.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had a net DTA of   $46.2 million   and   $50.7 million  , respectively, with the decrease from the prior period due primarily to current period net income.  There are a number of tax issues that impact the DTA balance, including changes in temporary differences between the financial statement and tax recognition of revenue and expenses and estimates as to the deductibility of prior losses.  
  Other Real Estate Owned (     OREO     ) and Foreclosed Assets 
  OREO and other foreclosed assets acquired through loan foreclosure are initially recorded at estimated fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. The adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the reserve for loan losses. Due to the subjective nature of establishing the asset s fair value when it is acquired, the actual fair value of the OREO or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate. If it is determined that fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through non-interest expense. Operating costs associated with the assets after acquisition are also recorded as non-interest expense. Gains and losses on the disposition of OREO and foreclosed assets are netted and posted to other non-interest expenses.  
  Goodwill  
  Goodwill from an acquisition is the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements acquired. At a minimum, annual evaluation of the value of goodwill is required.   
  An entity may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Factors assessed include all relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, overall financial performance, other relevant entity or reporting unit specific events and, if applicable, a sustained decrease in share price.  If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, such as those described above, an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity shall perform a two-step impairment test.  
  The first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any, when it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists.  
  The second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  
  In relation to the goodwill recognized with the PPFS acquisition, Bank of America branch acquisition, and Home acquisition, management concluded as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 that there have been no material events or circumstances that have changed since the initial recognition of goodwill on August 1, 2016, March 4, 2016, and May 16, 2014, respectively, the dates the PPFS acquisition, Bank of America branch acquisition, and Home acquisition were completed, that lead management  
  
   45 

to believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Bank is less than its carrying amount. Therefore, no further testing is deemed necessary.  

Economic Conditions 
    
  The Company s banking business is closely tied to the economies of Idaho, Oregon and Washington, which in turn are influenced by regional and national economic trends and conditions. Idaho, Oregon and Washington have recently been experiencing improved economic trends, including population in-migration, gains in employment and increased commercial business and real estate activity. National and regional economies and real estate prices have stabilized, as has business and consumer confidence. The Company s markets, however, continue to be sensitive to general economic trends and conditions, including real estate values, and an unforeseen economic shock or a return of adverse economic conditions could cause deterioration of local economies and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Financial Highlights  
    
  Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was   $4.1 million  , or   $0.06   per share. Net income for the second quarter of 2016 ( linked quarter ) was   $4.8 million  , or   $0.07   per share. The third quarter earnings were negatively affected by non-recurring expense items of   $2.6 million   (pre-tax), or   $0.02   per share (post tax), mainly related to the PPFS acquisition and certain branch consolidation costs.  
    
  The acquisition of PPFS was completed at the close of business on August 1, 2016, with customer system conversion accomplished in late October.  PPFS is headquartered in Lynnwood, Washington at the northern intersection of the I-5 and I-405 traffic corridors.  This location complements Cascade Bancorp s existing downtown Seattle commercial banking location. The Bank assumed approximately   $102.8 million   of loans and   $101.5 million   of deposits, for a purchase price of   $16.2 million   in the form of   2,921,012   Cascade Bancorp shares of common stock.  As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded   $2.2 million   of goodwill. 
    
  On   March 4, 2016  , the Bank completed the acquisition of   12   Oregon branch locations and   three   Washington branch locations from Bank of America, National Association (the  branch acquisition ). This transaction allows Cascade the opportunity to enhance and strengthen its footprint in Oregon, while providing entry into the Washington market.  The Bank assumed approximately   $469.9 million   of branch deposits, paying a   2.00%   premium on the average balance of deposits assumed, for a cash purchase price of   $9.7 million  .  Assets and liabilities assumed in the branch acquisition were recorded at fair value.  As a result of the branch acquisition, the Company recorded   $4.0 million   of goodwill. 
    
  The financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   are inclusive of the effects of the combined results of operations following the PPFS acquisition and the branch acquisition (together, the "2016 acquisitions ).  Due to the timing of the 2016 acquisitions, certain comparisons between periods are significantly affected by the transactions. 

Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was   $4.1 million  , or   $0.06   per share, compared to   $4.8 million  , or   $0.07   per share, for the linked quarter and   $5.1 million  , or   $0.07   per share, for the third quarter of 2015.  The third quarter earnings were negatively affected by non-recurring expense items of   $2.6 million   (pre-tax), or   $0.02   per share (post tax), mainly related to the PPFS acquisition and certain branch consolidation costs.  

The cost of funds remained stable at   0.08%   for the third quarter. 

Net interest income was   $23.8 million   for the third quarter, up   $1.6 million  , or   7.1%  , from the linked quarter.  Stronger interest revenue is due to higher average earning assets from both organic growth and the PPFS acquisition.  

Net interest margin ( NIM ) was   3.43%   for the third quarter, up from the linked quarter s   3.40%   resulting from an improving earning asset mix.  

Net loan recoveries for the third quarter were   $0.6 million  . The allowance for loan losses ( ALLL ) at quarter end was   1.23%   of gross loans. No provision or credit for loan losses was recorded in the third quarter.  Credit quality metrics  
     
   46 

remained stable. 

Return on average assets and return on average tangible assets   3    in the third quarter were   0.53%   and   0.54%  , respectively, compared to   0.65%   and   0.68%   in the linked quarter, respectively.  The change was mainly a result of non-recurring expense items in the third quarter. 

Return on average stockholders  equity and return on average tangible stockholders  equity   4    in the current quarter was   4.53%   and   6.20%  , respectively, compared to   5.65%   and   7.85%   in the linked quarter, respectively.  
       
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  This Form 10-Q contains certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP.  The Company s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, specifically return on average tangible assets, return on average tangible stockholders equity, organic loan growth, tangible book value per common share, tangible common equity ratio to total assets and tangible stockholders  equity, as important measures of the strength of the Company s capital and its ability to generate earnings on its tangible capital invested by its shareholders.  Management believes presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to our investors and others that contributes to a proper understanding of the financial results and capital levels of the Company.  Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company s performance.  These non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.  Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables below.  

1   Organic loan growth is a non-GAAP measure defined as total loan growth less acquired loans during the period. See below for a reconciliation of organic loan growth. 
    2   Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measure defined as total stockholders  equity, less the sum of core deposit intangible ( CDI ) and goodwill, divided by total number of shares outstanding.  See below for a reconciliation of tangible book value per common share. 
   3    Return on average tangible assets is a non-GAAP measure defined as net income divided by average total assets, less the sum of average CDI and goodwill. See below for a reconciliation of return on average tangible assets.  
   4   Return on average tangible stockholders  equity is a non-GAAP measure defined as net income divided by average total stockholders  equity, less the sum of average CDI and goodwill. See below for a reconciliation of return on average tangible stockholders  equity.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  Income Statement 
    
  Net Income 
    
  Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was   $4.1 million  , or   $0.06   per share, compared to   $4.8 million  , or   $0.07   per share, for the linked quarter and   $5.1 million  , or   $0.07   per share, for the third quarter of 2015 (the "year ago period ).  Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $10.9 million  , or   $0.15   per share, compared to   $15.0 million  , or   $0.21   per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
  The third quarter included non-recurring expense items of   $2.6 million   (pre-tax), or approximately   $0.02   per share (post tax), mainly related to the acquisition of PPFS and certain branch consolidation costs.  Similarly, the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $7.2 million of generally non-recurring costs mainly related to the branch acquisition, PPFS acquisition and certain branch consolidation costs.  
    
  Net Interest Income 
    
  Net interest income was $  23.8 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , as compared to   $20.4 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015  .   Net interest income was   $68.2 million   and   $60.7 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
    
  Total interest income increased   $3.5 million   from   $20.8 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015   to   $24.4 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  . Total interest income was   $69.8 million   and   $60.2 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Stronger interest income is due to higher average earning assets from both organic loan growth and the PPFS acquisition.  Interest income from investments is higher compared to prior periods due to deployment of cash received from the Bank of America branch acquisition into securities.  
    
  Total interest expense for the   third quarter   of   2016   and the year ago period was   $0.6 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively. The cost of funds for the third quarter, the linked quarter and the year ago period was   0.08%  . The year ago period did not include the   $469.9 million   in deposits acquired from Bank of America in March of 2016 or the   $101.5 million   in deposits acquired from the PPFS acquisition in August of 2016.  
    
  The NIM for the   third quarter   of   2016   was   3.43%  , compared to NIM of   3.72%   in the   third quarter   of   2015  . The NIM for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   3.53%  , compared to NIM of   3.72%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The NIM declined from prior periods because of the deployment of acquired funds into lower yielding securities and wholesale loans which will be replaced with originated loans over time. Sustained low market interest rates have also contributed to NIM compression. 
    
  Components of Net Interest Margin 
    
  The following tables set forth the components of the Company s NIM for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The tables present average balance sheet information, interest income and yields on average interest-earning assets, interest expense and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, net interest income, net interest spread and NIM for the Company (dollars in thousands): 
  
   50 

(1) 
    Average non-performing loans included in the computation of average loans for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was approximately   $4.1 million  . 
              (2) 
    Loan related fees, including prepayment penalties, recognized during the period and included in the yield calculation totaled approximately   $0.6 million   and   $1.0 million   in   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
              (3) 
    Includes loans held for sale. 

51 

(1) 
    Average non-performing loans included in the computation of average loans for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was approximately   $3.9 million   and   $5.8 million  , respectively. 
              (2) 
    Loan related fees, including prepayment penalties, recognized during the period and included in the yield calculation totaled approximately   $1.5 million   and   $2.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
              (3) 
    Includes loans held for sale.

Analysis of Changes in Interest Income and Expense 
    
  The following table shows the dollar amount of increase (decrease) in the Company s consolidated interest income and expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and attributes such variance to  volume  or  rate  changes (dollars in thousands). The changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each. 

53 

Loan Loss Provision and Reserve for Loan Losses 
    
  There was   no   provision for loan loss in the third quarter of 2016, linked quarter or third quarter of 2015.  
    
  The Bank maintains pooled and impaired loan reserves with additional consideration of qualitative factors and unallocated reserves in reaching its determination of the total reserve for loan losses. The level of reserves is subject to review by the Bank s regulatory authorities who may require adjustments to the reserve based on their evaluation and opinion of economic and industry factors as well as specific loans in the portfolio. For further discussion, see  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in this Form 10-Q and  Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality  in Item 7 of our 2015 Annual Report. There can be no assurance that the reserve for credit losses will be sufficient to cover actual loan-related losses.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the reserve for loan losses was   $25.2 million  , or   1.23%   of outstanding loans, compared to   $24.4 million  , or   1.45%   of outstanding loans, at   December 31, 2015  . The Company s reserve for loan losses ratio has decreased from   December 31, 2015  , however management considers the level of the reserve to be adequate based on assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio, including loan portfolio credit quality. Activity in the reserve during the period includes   $5.3 million   gross recoveries on loans previously charged off, largely offset by a write-down of a loan in the Bank s mining and energy SNC portfolio.  Aggregate portfolio exposure to energy/mining sector is less than 1% of total loans. The unallocated portion of the reserve is subject to refinement as we continue to enhance our qualitative factors and assess uncertainties regarding our entry into new loan markets, new geographies and general uncertainty related to growth and economic conditions. In particular, management is evaluating its economic conditions qualitative factor as it relates to the duration of economic cycles. 
    
  The reserve for unfunded lending commitments was   $0.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , which remained unchanged from   December 31, 2015  . 

54 

Non-Interest Income 
    
  Non-interest income was as follows for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):  

Non-interest income for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $7.9 million   and   $21.2 million  , respectively, up from   $6.4 million   and   $19.2 million   during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  These increases are primarily a result of higher service fees and card-related revenue arising from increased volumes of accounts and transactions arising from the 2016 acquisitions. 
    
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , service charges on deposit accounts and card issuer and merchant service fees were up over the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   mainly due to higher transaction volumes including those from acquired branch customers following the acquisitions.  
    
  Earnings on BOLI for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased compared to the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   due to the receipt of a death benefit in the third quarter of 2016.  The Company has no plans to increase BOLI at this time. 
    
  Net mortgage banking income increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, mainly due to higher origination volumes and changes in the interest rate environment.  
    
  The Bank began to offer its customer interest rate swaps and SBA services in 2013 in order to increase its services to customers and diversify its revenue sources. Changes in customer swap fee income and SBA revenue for the   third quarter   and year to date periods of   2016   generally relate to the timing of transaction settlement for these services compared to the respective year ago periods.   
    
  Gain on sales of investments decreased for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   due to a gain on sale of certain short duration MBS investment securities in the available for sale portfolio in the year ago periods. 
    
  Other income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $0.4 million   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , due to increased volumes of accounts and transactions arising from the 2016 acquisitions.  Other income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased compared to   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as the year ago period included a contractual arrangement for future revenue-sharing of merchant services totaling   $1.1 million.    

55 

Non-Interest Expense 
    
  Non-interest expense was as follows for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):  

Non-interest expense for the third quarter of   2016   was   $25.2 million   compared to   $19.1 million   for the third quarter of   2015  .  Non-interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $72.1 million   compared to   $56.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The year-over-year increase in non-interest expense was largely a result of   $7.2 million   in generally non-recurring costs mainly related to the branch acquisition, PPFS acquisition and certain branch consolidations, as well as the increase in run-rate expenses associated with the additional branches obtained in the 2016 acquisitions. Incremental run rate expenses of the 2016 acquisitions primarily impact salaries and benefits, occupancy, information technology, equipment, card issuer and other expenses as described below. 
    
  Total salaries and benefits increased   $1.9 million   and   $6.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily related to ongoing costs of   $1.2 million   and   $2.4 million   associated with staffing our expanded branch network following the acquisitions for the respective periods, as well as non-recurring costs of acquired branch employees, including severance, healthcare and other benefit accruals.  
    
  Information technology for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased from the same periods in   2015  , due primarily to one-time system conversion costs and ongoing service associated with the 2016 acquisitions. 
    
  Occupancy and communications expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased an aggregate of   $1.5 million   and   $3.3 million  , respectively, compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily related to generally non-recurring costs associated with the branch acquisition, PPFS acquisition and certain branch consolidations. In addition, the year ago period included credits to occupancy on the disposition of decommissioned branches. Equipment expenses showed an increase from the year ago periods due to costs associated with the 2016 acquisitions.  
    
  OREO expense fluctuations for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the respective periods in 2015 related to the timing of sales of OREO properties.   
    
  Professional services were relatively stable for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. Professional services increased for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   due mainly to the branch acquisition and PPFS acquisition-related costs.  
    
  Card issuer expenses increased for the three and nine month period ended   September 30, 2016   related to increased volume and related charges following the 2016 acquisitions. 

56 

Insurance expenses remained consistent for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 and decreased   11.0%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , largely as a result of lower risk rate on renewal of insurance.  
    
  Other expenses increased for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same periods in   2015  , mainly related to costs associated with the 2016 acquisitions. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company recorded an income tax provision of   $2.4 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $2.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The income tax provision for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $6.4 million   compared to   $8.6 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the DTA was $  46.2 million  . This is compared with a DTA as of   December 31, 2015   of $  50.7 million  . Our estimated effective income tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to the exclusion of certain BOLI and municipal loan and bond interest income from taxable income.  
    
  In assessing the Company s ability to utilize its DTA, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTA will not be realized. The ultimate realization of DTA is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.  Management considers the nature and amount of historical and projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables. 

Financial Condition 
    
  Total Assets and Liabilities 
    
  Total assets at   September 30, 2016   increased to   $3.2 billion  , compared to   $2.5 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , with higher cash and cash equivalents, investments, and loans outstanding.  
    
  Cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   were   $152.4 million   compared to   $77.8 million   at   December 31, 2015   due to deposits assumed in the recent 2016 acquisitions.  
    
  Investment securities classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity were   $664.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $449.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The increase is due to the deployment of excess cash assumed in the recent 2016 acquisitions into investment securities.  
    
  Total loans at   September 30, 2016   were   $2.1 billion  , compared to   $1.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Loan growth was distributed among commercial real estate, construction, consumer residential and commercial and industrial loans. Consumer residential included both retained and acquired mortgages. Strategically, the Bank continued to expand its ARM portfolio to further diversify its overall loan portfolio by geography and loan type. Organic growth was partially offset by a modest decline in the SNC portfolio.  
    
  FHLB stock remained steady with   $3.0 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   $3.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , goodwill increased to   $84.8 million  , compared to   $78.6 million   at   December 31, 2015   due primarily to the premium paid for   $469.9 million   in deposits assumed with the branch acquisition and the premium paid in the PPFS acquisition.   
    
  Other assets increased to   $58.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $35.9 million   at   December 31, 2015   due primarily to an increase in customer swap collateral and mark to market adjustments for swap assets. 
    
  Total deposits increased to   $2.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $2.1 billion   at   December 31, 2015   due primarily to deposits assumed in the recent 2016 acquisitions.  Increases from December 31, 2015 were visible across all deposit types, with significant impact in non-interest bearing accounts (up   $218.6 million  , or   30.0%  ) and interest bearing demand (up   $327.8 million  , or   31.4%  ). The overall cost of funds was   0.08%   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015  , and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  

57 

From time to time the Company makes commitments to acquire banking properties or to make equipment or technology related investments of capital. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no material capital expenditure commitments apart from those incurred in the ordinary course of business. 
    
  Stockholders      Equity and Capital Resources 
    
  Total stockholders  equity at   September 30, 2016   was $  367.0 million  , as compared to   $336.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The increase in total stockholders  equity was due to the stock issuance in connection with the acquisition of PPFS and interim period net income.  At   September 30, 2016  , the total common equity to total assets ratio was   11.56%   and the Company s basic book value per share was   $4.81   as compared to the total common equity to total assets ratio of   13.65%   and basic book value per share of   $4.63   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bancorp s and Bank s capital ratios exceeded the requirements to be designated as  well-capitalized  under the Basel III regulatory capital framework.  Additional information regarding capital requirements can be found in Note 13 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q.  

58 

Asset Quality 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, net recoveries were approximately   $0.6 million   and the reserve for loan losses was   $25.2 million  , compared to   $24.4 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The ratio of loan loss reserve to total loans was   1.23%   at September 30, 2016 compared to   1.45%   at   December 31, 2015  .  The lower ratio is related to an increase in total loan balances and continued positive credit quality metrics.  
    
  Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets was   0.46%   at September 30, 2016, as compared to   0.34%   at   December 31, 2015   and   0.36%   at September 30, 2015.  The increase relates to risk-rating downgrades in the mining/energy sector of the loan portfolio offset by several upgrades of previously adversely risk rated credits. The Company s aggregate mining and energy exposure is less than   1.0%   of total loans. 
    
  Year-to-date net recoveries include a first quarter 2016   $3.3 million   recovery on a previously charged off loan that was partially offset by a   $2.7 million   charge off related to downgrades in the SNC portfolio with exposure to the oil and mining sector at September 30, 2016. The Company s aggregate mining and energy exposure remained less than 1.0% of total loans, and management believes it has adequately reserved for such risks.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $22.3 million   of the   $298.8 million   in acquired loans were covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. These loss sharing agreements will expire five years after the date of the FDIC agreements for non-single family covered assets and 10 years after the acquisitions date for single-family covered assets. The Company has determined it will report on a cash basis any potential future benefits and/or costs incurred with respect to the remaining loss share receivables (or payables) under these agreements. The remaining benefit and/or cost of the FDIC loss sharing agreements are not expected to be material to the Company s financial condition.  Estimated future losses on acquired covered loans are included in the fair value purchase accounting mark. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  The following table summarizes the Bank s off-balance sheet commitments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the customer contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of fees. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  
    
  The Bank applies established credit standards and underwriting practices in evaluating the creditworthiness of such obligors and related collateral requirements, if any.  Collateral held for commitments varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties.  The Bank typically does not obtain collateral related to credit card commitments.   
    
  Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, the Bank would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Bank could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment were funded, the Bank would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. The Bank s policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those involved in extending loans to customers. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. 
    
  The increase in commitments to extend credit from the balance at   December 31, 2015   to the balance at   September 30, 2016   was primarily related to an increase in commercial real estate and credit card lending commitments.  
  
   59 

Other than those commitments discussed above, there are no other obligations or liabilities of the Company arising from its off-balance sheet arrangements that are or are reasonably likely to become material.  In addition, the Company knows of no event, demand, commitment, trend or uncertainty that will result in or is reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in availability of the off-balance sheet arrangements. The Company had no material off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Liquidity and Sources of Funds  
    
  The objective of the Bank s liquidity management is to maintain sufficient cash flows to meet obligations for depositor withdrawals, to fund the borrowing needs of loan customers, and to fund ongoing operations. At   September 30, 2016  , liquid assets of the Bank were mainly interest bearing balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( FRB ) totaling   $80.0 million   compared to   $22.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily the result of cash assumed in the recent 2016 acquisitions. 
    
  Core relationship deposits are the Bank s primary source of funds. As such, the Bank focuses on deposit relationships with local business and consumer clients who maintain multiple accounts and services at the Bank. The Company views such deposits as the foundation of its long-term liquidity because it believes such core deposits are more stable and less sensitive to changing interest rates and other economic factors compared to large time deposits or wholesale purchased funds. The Bank s customer relationship strategy has resulted in a relatively higher percentage of its deposits being held in checking and money market accounts, and a lesser percentage in time deposits. 
    
   In March 2016 and August 2016, the Company increased its core deposits with the purchase of branches and customer deposits from Bank of America and the acquisition of PPFS. Management believes such deposits have enhanced its liquidity profile.  
    
  The Bank augments core deposits with wholesale funds from time to time. The Bank may accept local relationship-based reciprocal Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ( CDARS ) and Demand Deposit Marketplace ( DDM ) deposits. Regulators classify such as brokered deposits. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $1.0 million   and   $10.0 million   in reciprocal CDARS, respectively, and   $80.3 million   and   $76.0 million   in reciprocal DDM deposits, respectively.  
    
  The Bank accepts public fund deposits in Oregon, Idaho and Washington and follows rules imposed by state authorities. Current rules imposed by the Oregon and Washington State Treasuries require that the Bank collateralize  no less than   50%   of the uninsured public funds of Oregon and Washington entities held by the Bank, respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank was in compliance with these requirements. Currently, there are no collateral requirements set on Idaho public deposits. 
    
  The Bank also utilizes borrowings and lines of credit as sources of funds. At   September 30, 2016  , the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ( FHLB ) had extended the Bank a secured line of credit of   $1.0 billion   (  35.00%   of total assets) accessible for short or long-term borrowings given sufficient qualifying collateral. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had qualifying collateral pledged for FHLB borrowings totaling   $611.3 million  , of which the Bank had   no   indebtedness. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank also had undrawn borrowing capacity at FRB of   $17.8 million   supported by specific qualifying collateral. Borrowing capacity from FHLB or FRB may fluctuate based upon the acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral, and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion. Also, FRB or FHLB could restrict or limit our access to secured borrowings. Correspondent banks have extended   $90.0 million   in unsecured or collateralized short-term lines of credit for the purchase of federal funds. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   outstanding borrowings under these federal fund borrowing agreements. 
    
  Liquidity may be affected by the Bank s routine commitments to extend credit. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had   $598.6 million   in total outstanding commitments to extend credit, compared to   $550.4 million   at year-end   2015  . At this time, management believes that the Bank s available resources will be sufficient to fund its commitments in the normal course of business. 
    
  The investment portfolio also provides a secondary source of funds as investments may be pledged for borrowings or sold for cash. This liquidity is limited, however, by counterparties  willingness to accept securities as collateral and the market value of securities at the time of sale could result in a loss to the Bank. As of   September 30, 2016  , the book value of unpledged investments totaled   $465.1 million   compared to   $331.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Bancorp is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is dividends received from the Bank. Oregon banking laws impose certain limitations on the payment of dividends by Oregon state chartered banks.  The amount of the dividend may not be greater than the Bank s unreserved retained earnings, deducting from that, to the extent not already charged against earnings or reflected in a reserve, the following: (1) all bad debts, which are debts on which interest is past due and unpaid for at least six months, unless the debt is fully secured and in the process of collection; (2) all other assets charged off as required by  
  
   60 

the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or a state or federal examiner; and (3) all accrued expenses, interest and taxes of the institution.  
    
  Inflation 
    
  The effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different than on non-banking companies since virtually all of a bank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. In particular, interest rates are significantly affected by inflation, but neither the timing nor magnitude of the changes are directly related to price level indices; therefore, the Company can best counter inflation over the long term by managing net interest income and controlling net increases in noninterest income and expenses. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Our assessment of market risk as of   September 30, 2016   indicates there are no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures from those in our 2015 Annual Report. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedure 
    
  As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  The Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.  While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
    
  In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors previously disclosed in Part I   Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2015 Annual Report. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q.  There have been no material changes to Cascade s risk factors described in our 2015 Annual Report.   

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
    
  (a)-(b) Not applicable. 
    
  (c) During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not repurchase any shares. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

61 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
