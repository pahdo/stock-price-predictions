NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements of Poage Bankshares, Inc. (the  Company ) and its wholly owned subsidiary Town Square Bank (which
was formerly operated under the name  Home Federal Savings and Loan Association ) (the  Bank ) have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information
and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules
and regulations. 

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period.  Estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements are based on various
factors including the current interest rate environment and the general strength of the local economy.  Changes in the overall
interest rate environment can significantly affect the Company s net interest income and the value of its recorded assets
and liabilities.  Actual results could differ from those estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying
unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly
the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the results of operations and cash flows
for the interim periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All interim amounts have not been audited, and the results of operations
for the interim periods herein are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the year. These consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto filed as part of the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Newly Issued Accounting Standards Not
Yet Effective  

In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. 
This ASU replaces the measurement for credit losses from a probable incurred estimate with an expected future loss model, which
is referred to as the  current expected credit loss  or  (CECL)  model. The standard pertains to financial
assets measured at amortized cost such as loans, debt securities classified as held-to-maturity, and certain other contracts. The
largest impact will be on the allowance for loan and lease losses. The update is effective for public entities for fiscal years
beginning after December 15. 2019, including interim periods within, which will apply to March 31, 2020, interim financial statements
for calendar year-ends. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s financial
statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-15,  Statements of Cash Flows   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. 
This update is designed to address the diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in
the statement of cash flows. The standard also provides guidance on when an entity should separate cash flows and classify them
into more than one class and when an entity should classify the aggregate of those cash flows into a single class based on the
predominance principle. The update is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim
periods within those fiscal years, which first applies to March 31, 2018, interim financial statements for calendar year-end public
business entities. We do not believe this update will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2    SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE  

The amortized cost and fair value of securities
available for sale at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the corresponding amounts of gross unrealized gains and losses
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows (in thousands): 

The proceeds from sales and calls of securities and the associated
gains and losses are listed below (in thousands): 

The amortized cost and fair value of the
securities portfolio at September 30, 2016 are shown in the following table by contractual maturity. Expected maturities may differ
from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
Securities not due at a single maturity date are shown separately (in thousands): 

The following table summarizes the securities
with unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, aggregated by major security type and length of time in a continuous
unrealized loss position (in thousands): 

Unrealized losses on bonds have not been
recognized into income because the issuers of the bonds are of high credit quality, management does not intend to sell and it is
not more likely than not that management would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the
decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach
maturity. 

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary
impairment ( OTTI ) on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such
an evaluation.  For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized
loss, and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or
it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized
cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost
and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings.  For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria,
the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: 1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the
income statement, and 2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income.  The credit loss
is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis.
For equity securities, the entire amount of impairment is recognized through earnings.

NOTE 3   LOANS  

Loans at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 were as follows (in thousands):

The following tables present the balance
in the allowance for loan losses and the recorded investment in loans by portfolio segment based on impairment method as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Accrued interest receivable and net deferred loan fees are not considered significant and therefore
are not included in the loan balances presented in the table below (in thousands): 

September 30, 2016

13  

The following
tables present the average balance of loans individually evaluated for impairment and interest income recognized on these loans
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

The recorded investment in loans excludes accrued interest receivable
and loan origination fees, net, due to immateriality. For purposes of this disclosure, the unpaid balance is not reduced for partial
charge-offs. 

14  

The following tables sets forth an analysis of our allowance
for loan losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

15  

Nonaccrual loans, and loans past due 90 days still on accrual
status, consist of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. 

The following table presents the recorded
investment in nonaccrual and loans past due over 90 days still on accrual status, by class of loans, as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 (in thousands): 

16  

The following tables present the aging
of the recorded investment in past due loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 by class of loans. As of September
30, 2016, consumer residential properties in process of foreclosure was $800,000 compared to $863,000 at December 31, 2015. Non-accrual
loans of $3.8 million as of September 30, 2016 and $4.5 million at December 31, 2015 are included in the tables below and have
been categorized based on their payment status (in thousands): 

17  

Troubled Debt Restructurings : 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has a recorded investment
in six TDRs which totaled $3.4 million. There were three TDRs which totaled $307,000 at December 31, 2015. A less than market rate
and extended term was granted as concessions for TDRs. No additional charge-off or provision has been made for the loan relationships.
No additional commitments to lend have been made to the borrower. 

There were two TDRs, one commercial real estate loan and one
commercial and industrial loan, which occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016. There were three TDRs, one commercial
real estate loan, one commercial and industrial loan and one residential real estate loan, which occurred during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. There was one TDR, a residential real estate loan, which occurred during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015. 

The modifications did not include a permanent reduction of the
recorded investment in the loans and did not increase the allowance for loan losses during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. There were no TDRs that subsequently defaulted within twelve months of modification during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

18  

The following table presents TDRs that occurred during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 (dollars in thousands): 

19  

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS:  

The Company categorizes loans into risk
categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information,
historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The
Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes all non-homogeneous loans,
such as commercial and commercial real estate loans. The analysis for residential real estate and consumer loans primarily includes
review of past due status. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk
ratings: 

Special Mention.  Loans
classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected,
these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit
position at some future date. 

Substandard.  Loans classified
as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged,
if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized
by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful.  Loans classified
as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses
make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and
improbable. 

Loss.  Loans classified
as loss are considered uncollectable and of such little value that continuing to carry them as an asset is not feasible. 
Loans will be classified as a loss when it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off or reserving all or a portion of
a basically worthless asset, even though partial recovery may be possible at some time in the future. 

Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually
as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. 

Based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category
of loans by class of loans is as follows (in thousands): 

There were $1.8 million and $2.3 million purchased credit impaired
( PCI ) loans included in substandard loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

20  

The Company holds purchased loans without
evidence of credit quality deterioration and purchased loans for which there was, at their acquisition date, evidence of deterioration
of credit quality since their origination and it was probable that all contractually required payments would not be collected.
A summary of non-impaired purchased loans and credit-impaired purchased loans with the carrying amount of those loans is as follows: 

For the purchased loans disclosed above, the Company did not
increase the allowance for loan losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

21  

The following table presents the composition
of the acquired loans at September 30, 2016: 

The following tables presents the purchased
loans that are included within the scope of ASC Topic 310-30,  Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality, 
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The Company adjusted interest income to recognize $42,000, and
$128,000 of accretable yield on credit-impaired purchased loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company
adjusted interest income to recognize $40,000, and $189,000 of accretable yield on credit-impaired purchased loans for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

22  

Accretable yield, or income expected to be collected, is as
follows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

2015 were as follows (in thousands): 

Payments contractually required over the next five years are
as follows as of September 30, 2016 (in thousands): 

NOTE 5   FAIR VALUE  

Fair value is the exchange price that would
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that
may be used to measure fair values: 

Level 1   Quoted prices (unadjusted)
for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 

Level 2   Significant other observable
inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not
active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3   Significant unobservable
inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset
or liability. 

23  

The Company used the following methods
and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: 

Securities : The fair values for
securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are based on quoted market prices of similar securities (Level 2). This includes the use of  matrix pricing  used to
value debt securities absent the exclusive use of quoted prices. For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar
securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows (Level 3). 

Impaired Loans : The fair value of
impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals.
Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable
sales and income data available for similar loans and collateral underlying such loans. Non-real estate collateral may be valued
using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based
on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s
expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans
are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted in accordance with the allowance policy. 

Other Real Estate Owned  : Nonrecurring
adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate owned (OREO) are measured
at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. Fair values are generally based on third party appraisals of
the property resulting in a Level 3 classification. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell,
an impairment loss is recognized. 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis are summarized below (in thousands): 

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2016
or 2015.

Commercial and residential real estate
properties classified as OREO are measured at fair value, less costs to sell. Fair values are based on recent real estate appraisals.
These appraisals may use a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.
Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable
sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the
inputs for determining fair value. Appraisals for real estate properties classified as other real estate owned are performed by
certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose
qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Bank s management. The appraisal values are discounted
to allow for selling expenses and fees, and the discounts range from 5% to 10%. 

At September 30, 2016, impaired loans recorded
at fair value had a net carrying amount of $150,000 equal to the outstanding balance of $161,000, net of a valuation allowance
of $11,000. There were charge-offs of $0 and $31,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $200,000 for both
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. At December 31, 2015, impaired loans recorded at fair value had a net carrying
amount of $222,000 equal to the outstanding balance of $237,000, net of a valuation allowance of $15,000. 

At September 30, 2016, OREO recorded at
fair value had a net carrying amount of $70,000 made up of the outstanding balance of $119,000 net of a valuation allowance of
$49,000, which resulted in a write-down of $34,000 and $48,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 respectively.
There were $95,400 write-downs for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. At December 31, 2015 no OREO was recorded
at fair value. 

25  

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial
instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands): 

The methods and assumptions, not previously presented, used
to estimate fair values are described as follows: 

Cash and Cash Equivalents:  

The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate
fair values and are classified as Level 1. 

Restricted Stock:  

It is not practical to determine the fair value of FHLB and
Bankers Bank of Kentucky stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. 

Loans:  

Fair values of loans, excluding loans held
for sale, are estimated as follows: For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk,
fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification. Fair values for other loans are estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar
credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification. The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily
represent an exit price. 

26  

The fair value of loans held for sale is
estimated based upon binding contracts and quotes from third party investors resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Deposits:  

The fair values disclosed for demand deposits
(e.g., interest and non-interest checking, passbook savings, and certain types of money market accounts) are by definition equal
to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount) resulting in a Level 1 classification. The
carrying amounts of variable rate, fixed-term money market accounts and certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at
the reporting date resulting in a Level 1 classification. Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using
a discounted cash flows calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated
expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Federal Home Loan Bank advances and subordinate debenture:  

The fair values of the Company s
long-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of
borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Accrued Interest Receivable/Payable:  

The carrying amounts of accrued interest
approximate fair value and are classified by level consistent with the level of the related assets or liabilities. 

NOTE 6    ESOP  

Employees participate in an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan ( ESOP ). The ESOP borrowed from the Company to purchase 269,790 shares of the Company s common
stock at $10 per share. The Company makes discretionary contributions to the ESOP, and pays dividends on unallocated shares to
the ESOP, and the ESOP uses funds it receives to repay the loan. When loan payments are made, ESOP shares are allocated to participants
based on relative compensation and expense is recorded. Dividends on allocated shares increase participant accounts. Participants
receive the shares at the end of employment. 

There were no contributions to the ESOP
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Shares held by the ESOP at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 

27  

NOTE 7   EARNINGS PER SHARE  

The factors used in the earnings per share
computation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands, except
per share data): 

Stock options of 200,600 shares of common stock were considered
in computing diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. No stock options were excluded
from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for September 30, 2016. Stock options of 234,650 shares of common stock
were not considered in computing diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 because
they were antidilutive. 

NOTE 8   STOCK BASED COMPENSATION  

On January 8, 2013, the shareholders of
Poage Bankshares, Inc. approved the Poage Bankshares, Inc. 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) for employees and
directors of the Company. The Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 472,132 shares of the Company s common stock, with no
more than 134,895 of shares as restricted stock awards and 337,237 as stock options, either incentive stock options or non-qualified
stock options. The exercise price of options granted under the Plan may not be less than the fair market value on the date the
stock option is granted. The compensation committee of the board of directors has sole discretion to determine the amount and to
whom equity incentive awards are granted. 

On April 16, 2013, the compensation committee
of the board of directors approved the issuance of 134,895 shares of restricted stock to its directors and officers. In addition,
on May 10, 2013, the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the issuance of 300,000 stock options to its directors
and officers. An additional 20,000 stock option shares were issued on March 19, 2014 as a result of the acquisition of Town Square
Financial Corporation by Poage Bankshares, Inc. An additional 5,000 stock option shares were issued on May 31, 2015 to employees.
All stock options and restricted stock awards vest ratably over five years. Stock options expire ten years after issuance. Apart
from the vesting schedule for both stock options and restricted stock, there are no performance-based conditions or any other material
conditions applicable to the awards issued. 

28  

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Stock options are assumed to be earned
ratably over their respective vesting periods and charged to compensation expense based upon their grant date fair value and the
number of options assumed to be earned. At September 30, 2016, 200,600 options were outstanding and 122,100 options were fully
vested and exercisable with aggregate intrinsic value of $880,000 and $535,000, respectively. At December 31, 2015, 205,500 options
were outstanding and 76,200 options were fully vested and exercisable with aggregate intrinsic value of $446,000 and $165,000,
respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 45,900 options vested. Stock-based compensation expense for stock
options included in salaries and benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $18,000 and $68,000, respectively.
Stock-based compensation for stock options included in salaries and benefits for the three and nine months ended September 2015
was ($4,000) and $56,000, respectively. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options was $130,000 at
September 30, 2016 and $208,000 at December 31, 2015 and is expected to be recognized over a period of 2   3 years. 

The following table summarizes non-vested restricted stock activity
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

The fair value of the restricted stock
awards is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period (generally five years) and is based on the market price of
the Company s common stock at the date of the grant multiplied by the number of shares granted that are expected to vest.
Stock-based compensation expense for the restricted stock included in salaries and benefits for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $55,000 and $233,000, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock included in salaries
and benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $36,000 and $237,000, respectively. Unrecognized compensation
expense for non-vested restricted stock awards was $357,000 at September 30, 2016 and $623,000 at December 31, 2015 and is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2 years.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015  

At September 30, 2016, the Company s
assets totaled $448.9 million, an increase of $13.8 million, or 3.2%, from $435.1 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was
attributed to growth in real estate loans during the quarter, funded by FHLB advances and non-interest bearing cash. 

Cash and Cash equivalents decreased by
$4.4 million, or 18.4%, to $19.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $23.9 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash was
primarily attributable to loan growth of $25.5 million and a decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank advances of $3.0 million, offset
by principal payments on securities of $6.2 million and an increase in deposits of $16.7 million. 

Loans held for sale increased $343,000,
or 93.5%, to $710,000 at September 30, 2016 from $367,000 at December 31, 2015 due to an increase in mortgage banking activity. 

Loans, net, increased $25.5 million, or
8.1%, to $339.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $314.1 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable
to an increase in commercial real estate, construction loans and commercial and industrial loans. Real estate secured loans increased
$17.8 million, commercial loans increased $6.0 million and consumer loans increased $2.2 million during the nine month period ended
September 30, 2016. Non-performing loans decreased $666,000, or 14.8%, to $3.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $4.5 million
at December 31, 2015. 

Securities available for sale decreased
by $6.2 million, or 9.7%, to $57.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $64.0 million at December 31, 2015. This decrease is primarily
due to $12.2 million in calls and principal payments, offset by $5.6 million in purchases. 

Deposits increased $16.7 million, or 4.9%,
to $359.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $343.1 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was attributable to an increase
in NOW and money market accounts combined with the $9.0 million in short-term certificates of deposits acquired in the nationwide
marketplace. 

Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased
$3.0 million, or 19.0%, to $12.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $15.8 million at December 31, 2015. This decrease in borrowings
was due to maturities. 

Other borrowings increased by $48,000,
or 1.7%, to $2.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $2.8 million at December 31, 2015 due to the amortization of the fair value
related to the subordinated debenture assumed in conjunction with acquisition of Town Square Financial Corporation. In December
2006, Town Square Statutory Trust I, a trust formed by Town Square Financial Corporation, closed a pooled private offering of 4,124
trust preferred securities with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per security. The subordinated debt of $2.8 million is shown as
a liability because the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the Trust. The investment in common stock of the trust
is $124,000 and is included in other assets. The subordinated debt has a variable rate of interest equal to the three month London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.83%, which was 2.68% at September 30, 2016. 

Total shareholders  equity decreased
by $1.5 million, or 2.1%, to $69.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $71.2 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease resulted
primarily from the repurchase of common stock totaling $3.2 million and the payment of cash dividends totaling $762,000, offset
by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income by $440,000 and net income of $1.6 million. 

33  

Average Balances and Yields  

The following table sets forth average
balances, average yields and costs, and certain other information at the dates and for the periods indicated. All average balances
are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans are included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the
tables as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that
are amortized or accreted to interest income. Interest income and rates exclude the effects of a tax equivalent adjustment to adjust
tax exempt investment income on tax exempt investment securities to a fully taxable basis due to immateriality (dollars in thousands). 

34  

35  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our primary sources of funds are deposits
and the proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities. We also utilize Federal Home Loan Bank
advances. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predicable sources of funds, deposit flows and
mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We generally manage
the pricing of our deposits to be competitive within our market and to increase core deposit relationships. 

Liquidity management is both a daily and
long-term responsibility of management. We adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of
(i) expected loan demand, (ii) expected deposit flows, (iii) yields available on interest-earning deposits and investment securities,
and (iv) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning
overnight deposits, federal funds sold, and short and intermediate-term investment securities. If we require funds beyond our ability
to generate them internally we have additional borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. At September 30,
2016, we had $12.8 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and an additional borrowing capacity of $101.6
million. 

Poage Bankshares, Inc. is a separate legal
entity from Town Square Bank and must provide its own liquidity to pay dividends, repurchase stock and to fund other general corporate
activities. Poage Bankshares, Inc. s primary source of liquidity is dividend payments from Town Square Bank. The ability
of Town Square Bank to pay dividends is subject to regulatory requirements. At September 30, 2016, Poage Bankshares, Inc. (on an
unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of $4.4 million. 

On June 16, 2016, Poage Bankshares, Inc.
executed a $2.0 million commercial line of credit secured with Town Square Bank common stock, with an unaffiliated lender. The
initial variable interest rate on the line of credit is 4.00% with an interest rate equal to the Wall Street Prime plus 0.50%.
The line of credit matures June 16, 2018. The line of credit will be used for general working capital purposes. At September 30,
2016, we have $2.0 million available on the line of credit. 

Federal regulations require FDIC-insured
depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of
4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a 4% Tier 1 capital
to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final
rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements
of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

For purposes of the regulatory capital
requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders  equity and retained earnings.
Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain
noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.
Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2
capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred
stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated
debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted
assets and, for institutions that made such an election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ),
up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions
that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale-securities). We have exercised the AOCI opt-out. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is
subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 

In determining the amount of risk-weighted
assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse
obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations
based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed
to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of
50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100%
is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of
between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 

In addition to establishing the minimum
regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management
if the institution does not hold a  capital conservation buffer  consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital
to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation
buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until
fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. When fully implemented, the capital conservation buffer will be 2.50% of risk weighted
assets over and above the regulatory minimum capital ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1) to risk weighted assets, Tier
1 Capital to risk weighted assets, and Total Capital to risk weighted assets.  The consequences of not meeting the capital
conservation buffer thresholds include restrictions on the payment of dividends, restrictions on the payment of discretionary bonuses,
and restrictions on the repurchasing of common shares by the Company. At September 30, 2016, the actual capital conservation buffer
for Town Square Bank was 13.43% compared to the capital conservation buffer requirement of 0.625%. 

In assessing an institution s capital
adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority
to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions when deemed necessary. 

As of September 30, 2016, the capital of the Town Square Bank
exceeded all required regulatory guidelines and Town Square Bank was categorized as well-capitalized. 

36  

The following table reflects the Bank s
current regulatory capital levels in more detail, including comparisons to the regulatory minimums at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 (in thousands). 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  
In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of
credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers  requests for funding
and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. These arrangements are not expected to have a material impact on the
Company s financial condition or results of operations. 

37  

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three and Nine months
Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  

General.   Net income for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $166,000 to $364,000 from net income of $530,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in net income is primarily attributable to an increase in the provision for loan losses of $352,000 to $352,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, offset by a decrease
in professional fees of $101,000 to $137,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $238,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015 and a decrease in other taxes of $111,000 to $106,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $217,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net income for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 decreased $1.3 million to $1.5 million from net income of $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
decrease in net income is primarily attributable to a decrease in bargain purchase gain of $1.6 million to $0 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and an increase in the provision
for loan losses of $327,000 to $812,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $485,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, offset by a decrease in early termination fee and conversion cost of $503,000 to $0 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $503,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Interest Income.   Interest
