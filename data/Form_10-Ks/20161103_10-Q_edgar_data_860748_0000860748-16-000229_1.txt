Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including, but not limited to, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ), Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Risk Factors and the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (including the notes thereto) of Kemper Corporation ( Kemper ) and its subsidiaries (individually and collectively referred to herein as the  Company ) may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based on forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
  Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as  believe(s),   goal(s),   target(s),   estimate(s),   anticipate(s),   forecast(s),   project(s),   plan(s),   intend(s),   expect(s),   might,   may,   could  and other terms of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements, in particular, include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results. 
  Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong, and, accordingly, Kemper cautions readers not to place undue reliance on such statements. Kemper bases these statements on current expectations and the current economic environment as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These statements are not guarantees of future performance; actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties that may be important in determining the Company s actual future results and financial condition.   
  In addition to those factors discussed under Item 1A.,  Risk Factors,  of Part I of Kemper s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the    2015   Annual Report ) as updated by Item 1A. of Part II of subsequently-filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the reader should consider the following list of general factors that, among others, could cause the Company s actual results and financial condition to differ materially from estimated results and financial condition.

     Factors relating to the business environment in which Kemper and its subsidiaries operate 
             
    Changes in general economic conditions, including, but not limited to, performance of financial markets, interest rates, inflation, unemployment rates and fluctuating values of particular investments held by the Company; 
                
    Absolute and relative performance of investments held by the Company; 
                
    Changes in insurance industry trends and significant industry developments; 
                
    Changes in consumer trends and significant consumer or product developments; 
                
    Changes in capital requirements, including the calculations thereof, used by regulators and rating agencies; 
                
    Regulatory, accounting or tax changes that may affect the cost of, or demand for, the Company s products or services or after-tax returns from the Company s investments; 
                
    The impact of required participation in windpools and joint underwriting associations, residual market assessments and assessments for insurance industry insolvencies; 
                
    Changes in distribution channels, methods or costs resulting from changes in laws or regulations, lawsuits or market forces;  
                
    Increased costs and risks related to cybersecurity and information technology, including, but not limited to, identity theft, data breaches and system disruptions affecting services and actions taken to minimize the risks thereof; and 
     Other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in Kemper s filings with the SEC  . 
  Kemper cannot provide any assurances that the results contemplated in any forward-looking statements will be achieved or will be achieved in any particular timetable or that future events or developments will not cause such statements to be inaccurate. Kemper assumes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statements publicly for any changes in events or developments or in the Company s expectations or results subsequent to the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Kemper advises the reader, however, to consult any further disclosures Kemper makes on related subjects in its filings with the SEC.

KEMPER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  Note 1 - Basis of Presentation 
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and include the accounts of Kemper Corporation ( Kemper ) and its subsidiaries (individually and collectively referred to herein as the  Company ) and are unaudited. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  
  On   April 30, 2015  , Kemper acquired   100%   of the outstanding common stock of Alliance United Group and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Alliance United Insurance Company and Alliance United Insurance Services (individually and collectively referred to herein as  Alliance United ) in a cash transaction. The results of Alliance United are included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition and are reported in the Company s Property   Casualty Insurance segment.  
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company changed its method for estimating the interest and service cost components of expense recognized for its pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans. As a result, the Company elected to use a full yield curve approach to estimate these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Prior to 2016, the interest and service cost components were estimated using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the projected benefit obligation or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, as relevant, at the beginning of the period. The change provides a more precise measurement of interest and service costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The Company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and, accordingly, recognized the effect prospectively in 2016. The change in method for estimating the interest and service cost components decreased pension expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   by approximately   $2.7 million  , but had no impact on the measurement of benefit obligations. 
  Insurance Reserves for life insurance products are comprised of reserves for future policy benefits plus an estimate of the Company s liability for unpaid life insurance claims and claims adjustment expenses, which includes an estimate for incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) life insurance claims. Prior to the third quarter of 2016, except when required by applicable law, the Company did not utilize the database of reported deaths maintained by the Social Security Administration or any other comparable database (a  Death Master File  or  DMF ) in its operations, including to determine its IBNR liability for life insurance products. Instead of using such a database, the Company calculated its IBNR liability for life insurance products using Company-specific historical information, which included analyzing average paid claims and the average lag between date of death and the date reported to the Company for claims for which due proof of death had been provided. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company initiated a voluntary enhancement of its claims handling procedures for its life insurance policies. The Company is now utilizing a DMF to identify potential situations where the Company has yet to be notified of an insured s death and, as appropriate, initiating an outreach process to identify and contact beneficiaries and settle claims. Policyholders  Benefits and Incurred Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses for both the   nine and three months ended     September 30, 2016   include a pre-tax charge of   $77.8 million   to recognize the impact of using a DMF in the Company s operations, including to determine its IBNR liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses for life insurance products. 
  Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements, including certain financial statement footnote disclosures, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) is not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting and has been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of the Company s management, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The preparation of interim financial statements relies heavily on estimates. This factor and other factors, such as the seasonal nature of some portions of the insurance business, as well as market conditions, call for caution in drawing specific conclusions from interim results. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  Adoption of New Accounting Guidance 
  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.   The amendments in ASU 2015-02 affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. Specifically, the amendments modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest entities while also eliminating the

  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation (continued) 
  presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. ASU 2015-02 may also affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. The Company's adoption and initial application as of January 1, 2016 resulted in no changes to the legal entities that the Company consolidates. 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07   Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).   ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The Company adopted ASU 2015-07 in the first quarter of 2016 and applied its provisions on a retrospective basis. Except for the change in disclosure requirements, adoption of ASU 2015-07 did not impact the Company s financial statements. The presentation of certain prior year amounts and disclosures have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the current year. 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-09,   Financial Services Insurance (Topic 944): Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts  . ASU 2015-09 requires insurers to provide additional disclosures about short-duration insurance contracts, focusing particularly on the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. Insurers will be required to disclose tables showing incurred and paid claims development information by accident year for the number of years that claims typically remain outstanding, although not to exceed ten years, as well as a reconciliation of this information to the balance sheet. Additional disclosures will also be required on the total of IBNR liabilities plus expected development on reported claims, reserving methodologies, quantitative information about claim frequency, qualitative description of the methodologies used for determining claim frequency and average annual percentage payout of incurred claims by age. ASU 2015-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2015 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Except for the additional disclosure requirements, adoption of ASU 2015-09 will not impact the Company s financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. Most significantly, ASU 2016-01 requires companies to measure equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily-determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus  
  changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. ASU 2016-01 also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily-determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value.  
  ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company currently records its Investments in Equity Securities at fair value with net unrealized appreciation or depreciation reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) in Shareholders  Equity. The Company s Investments in Equity Securities include securities with readily-determinable fair values and securities without readily-determinable fair values. Until the Company adopts ASU 2016-01 and makes its elections for Investments in Equity Securities that do not have readily-determinable fair values, it cannot determine the impact of the adoption on its consolidated balance sheet. Subsequent to adoption, ASU 2016-01 is expected to cause increased volatility in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases     (Topic 842  ), by amending the   Accounting Standards 
  Codification   and creating a new topic on accounting for leases. ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that requires most leases to be reported on the balance sheet of a lessee. ASU 2016-02 also aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in ASC 606, the FASB s new revenue recognition standard (e.g., those related to evaluating when profit can be recognized). Furthermore, ASU 2016-02 addresses other concerns related to the current leases model. For example, ASU 2016-02 eliminates the requirement in current GAAP for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification. ASU 2016-02 also requires lessors to increase the transparency of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim

  periods within those years with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted. The Company does not anticipate adoption to have a material impact on its financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   ASU 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that utilizes expected credit losses to provide for an allowance for credit losses for financial instruments and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The amendments in this ASU require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The income statement includes the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. Credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities are measured in a manner similar to current GAAP, although the ASU requires that they be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. In situations where the estimate of credit loss on an available-for-sale debt security declines, entities will be able to record the reversal to income in the current period, which GAAP currently prohibits. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018 and interim periods within such year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial statements. 
  The Company has adopted all other recently issued accounting pronouncements with effective dates prior to October 1, 2016.

  An aging of unrealized losses on the Company s Investments in Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities at   September 30, 2016   is presented below.   

  The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio for factors that may indicate that a decline in fair value of an investment is other than temporary. The portions of the declines in the fair values of investments that are determined to be other than temporary are reported as losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the periods when such determinations are made.  
  Unrealized losses on fixed maturities, which the Company has determined to be temporary at   September 30, 2016  , were   $15.4 million  , of which   $8.2 million   was related to fixed maturities that were in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer. There were   no   unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016   related to securities for which the Company has recognized credit losses in earnings in the preceding table under the heading  Less Than 12 Months.  There were   no   unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016   related to securities for which the Company has recognized credit losses in earnings in the preceding table under the heading  12 Months or Longer.    Investment-grade   fixed maturity investments comprised   $2.1 million  , and   below-investment-grade   fixed maturity investments comprised   $13.3 million   of the unrealized losses on investments in fixed maturities at   September 30, 2016  . For below-investment-grade fixed maturity investments in an unrealized loss position, the unrealized loss amount, on average, was approximately   5%   of the amortized cost basis of the investment. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not have the intent to sell these investments and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell these investments before it recovered the amortized cost of such investments, which may be at maturity. Based on the Company s evaluation at   September 30, 2016   of the prospects of the issuers, including, but not limited to, the credit ratings of the issuers of the investments in the fixed maturities, and the Company s intention to not sell and its determination that it would not be required to sell before it recovered the amortized cost of such investments, the Company concluded that the declines in the fair values of the Company s investments in fixed maturities presented in the preceding table were temporary at the evaluation date.

Note 2 - Investments (continued) 
  For equity securities, the Company considers various factors when determining whether a decline in the fair value is other than temporary, including, but not limited to: 
             
    The financial condition and prospects of the issuer; 
                
    The length of time and magnitude of the unrealized loss; 
                
    The volatility of the investment; 
                
    Analysts  recommendations and near-term price targets; 
                
    Opinions of the Company s external investment managers; 
                
    Market liquidity; 
                
    Debt-like characteristics of perpetual preferred stocks and issuer ratings; and 
                
    The Company s intention to sell or ability to hold an investment until recovery. 
     With respect to Investments in Equity Securities, the Company concluded that the unrealized losses on its investments in preferred and common stocks at   September 30, 2016   were temporary based on various factors, including the relative short length and magnitude of the losses and overall market volatility. The Company s investments in other equity interests include investments in limited liability companies and limited partnerships that primarily invest in mezzanine debt, distressed debt and secondary transactions. By the nature of their underlying investments, the Company believes that some of its investments in the limited liability companies and limited partnerships exhibit debt-like characteristics which, among other factors, the Company also considers when evaluating these investments for impairment. Based on evaluations of the factors in the preceding paragraph, the Company concluded that the declines in the fair values of the Company s investments in equity securities presented in the preceding table were temporary at   September 30, 2016  .

  An aging of unrealized losses on the Company s Investments in Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities at   December 31, 2015   is presented below.   

  Unrealized losses on fixed maturities, which the Company has determined to be temporary at   December 31, 2015  , were   $50.0 million  , of which   $16.9 million   was related to fixed maturities that were in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer. There were   $0.2 million   unrealized losses at   December 31, 2015   related to securities for which the Company has recognized credit losses in earnings in the preceding table under the heading  Less Than 12 Months.  There were   no   unrealized losses at   December 31, 2015   related to securities for which the Company has recognized credit losses in earnings in the preceding table under the heading  12 Months or Longer.    Investment-grade   fixed maturity investments comprised   $33.5 million   and   below-investment-grade   fixed maturity investments comprised   $16.5 million   of the unrealized losses on investments in fixed maturities at   December 31, 2015  . For below-investment-grade fixed maturity investments in an unrealized loss position, the unrealized loss amount, on average, was approximately   8%   of the amortized cost basis of the investment. At   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not have the intent to sell these investments, and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell these investments before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. Based on the Company s evaluation at   December 31, 2015   of the prospects of the issuers, including, but not limited to, the credit ratings of the issuers of the investments in the fixed maturities, and the Company s intention to not sell and its determination that it would not be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost of such investments, the Company concluded that the declines in the fair values of the Company s investments in fixed maturities presented in the preceding table were temporary at the evaluation date.

Note 3 - Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves 
  Property and casualty insurance reserve activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was:   

  Property and casualty insurance reserves are estimated based on historical experience patterns and current economic trends. Actual loss experience and loss trends are likely to differ from these historical experience patterns and economic conditions. Loss experience and loss trends emerge over several years from the dates of loss inception. The Company monitors such emerging loss trends on a quarterly basis. Changes in such estimates are included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of change. 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company reduced its property and casualty insurance reserves by   $21.0 million   to recognize favorable development of loss and LAE reserves from prior accident years.   Personal lines   insurance loss and LAE reserves developed favorably by   $17.7 million  , and   commercial lines   insurance loss and LAE reserves developed favorably by   $3.3 million  . The   commercial lines   insurance loss and LAE reserve development included   no   development from continuing operations and favorable development of   $3.3 million   from discontinued operations.   Personal automobile   insurance loss and LAE reserves developed adversely by   $7.3 million   due primarily to the emergence of loss patterns that were worse than expected for liability insurance for the 2015 accident year.   Homeowners   insurance loss and LAE reserves developed favorably by   $18.1 million   due primarily to   $14.3 million   of favorable development on catastrophes primarily for the 2015 and 2014 accident years.   Other personal lines   loss and LAE reserves developed favorably by   $6.9 million   due primarily to the emergence of more favorable loss patterns than expected for the 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 accident years.

Note 3 - Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves (continued) 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company reduced its property and casualty insurance reserves by   $16.3 million   to recognize favorable development of loss and LAE reserves from prior accident years.   Personal lines   insurance loss and LAE reserves developed favorably by   $13.5 million  , and   commercial lines   insurance loss and LAE reserves developed favorably by   $2.8 million  . The   commercial lines   insurance loss and LAE reserve development included adverse development of   $0.7 million   from continuing operations and favorable development of   $3.5 million   from discontinued operations. Personal automobile insurance loss and LAE reserves developed favorably by   $5.6 million  , homeowners insurance loss and LAE reserves developed favorably by   $8.8 million  , and other personal lines loss and LAE reserves developed adversely by   $0.9 million  . Personal lines insurance loss and LAE reserves developed favorably due primarily to the emergence of more favorable loss patterns than expected for the 2013, 2012 and 2011 accident years, partially offset by the emergence of loss patterns that were worse than expected for the 2014 accident year.  
  The Company cannot predict whether loss and LAE reserves will develop favorably or unfavorably from the amounts reported in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that any such development will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated shareholders  equity, but could have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial results for a given period.

  The statute of limitations related to Kemper and its eligible subsidiaries  consolidated Federal income tax returns is closed for all tax years up to and including 2012. The expiration of the statute of limitations related to the various state income tax returns that Kemper and its subsidiaries file varies by state.  
  Included in the balance of Unrecognized Tax Benefits at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are tax positions of   $3.2 million   and   $3.3 million  , respectively, for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting, other than for interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the effective income tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.  
  The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The liability for Unrecognized Tax Benefits included accrued interest of   $0.5 million   and   $0.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  Income taxes paid were   $10.4 million   and   $40.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   
  Note 9 - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions 
  The Company sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan (the  Pension Plan ). The Pension Plan covers approximately   9,200   participants and beneficiaries, of which   1,800   are active employees. The Pension Plan is closed to new employees hired after January 1, 2006. The components of Pension Expense (Benefit) for the Pension Plan for the   nine and three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were:   

  On May 12, 2016, the Company amended the Pension Plan to freeze benefit accruals, effective June 30, 2016, for substantially all of the participants under the plan. Accordingly, plan assets and liabilities were re-measured, resulting in balances in accumulated unrecognized pension loss and unamortized prior service credit prior to the freeze of   $191.2 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively. In recognizing the curtailment, the Company recorded income of   $0.3 million   before income taxes in the second quarter of 2016 to immediately recognize the remaining unamortized prior service credit in the Pension Plan. The curtailment reduced the accumulated unrecognized pension loss by   $23.3 million  . The remaining accumulated unrecognized

  pension loss of   $167.9 million   is being amortized over approximately   25 years  , the remaining average estimated life expectancy of participants. Prior to the amendment, the accumulated unrecognized pension loss was being amortized over approximately   five   years, the remaining average service life of active participants. 
  On August 12, 2016, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution of   $9.0 million   to the Pension Plan. 
  The Company also sponsors a non-qualified supplemental defined benefit pension plan (the  Supplemental Plan ). As a result of the amendment to the Pension Plan, benefit accruals for all participants in the Supplemental Plan were also frozen effective June 30, 2016. Accordingly, plan liabilities for the Supplemental Plan were also re-measured in the second quarter of 2016, resulting in balances in accumulated unrecognized pension loss and unamortized prior service costs prior to the freeze of   $1.6 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively. The Company recorded expense of   $1.3 million   in the second quarter of 2016 to immediately recognize the remaining net unamortized prior service costs in the Supplemental Plan. The curtailment reduced the Projected Benefit Obligation by   $5.2 million  . Accordingly, a curtailment gain of   $3.6 million   before tax was recorded to recognize the reduction in the Projected Benefit Obligation that exceeded the accumulated unrecognized pension loss prior to the freeze.  
  In addition to the Pension Plan and Supplemental Plan, the Company also sponsors several defined contribution benefit plans.  
  The Company also sponsors an other postretirement benefit ( OPEB ) plan that provides medical, dental and/or life insurance benefits to approximately   500   retired and   225   active employees (the  OPEB Plan ).

Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company classifies its investments in Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities as available for sale and reports these investments at fair value. The Company has elected the fair value option method of accounting for investments in certain hedge funds and, accordingly, reports these investments at fair value. The Company classifies certain investments in mutual funds included in Other Investments as trading securities and reports these investments at fair value. The Company has no material liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value. 
  Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value practical expedient are not required to be classified using the fair value hierarchy, but are presented in the following two tables to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation of assets measured at fair value in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at   September 30, 2016   is summarized below.   

  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had unfunded commitments to invest an additional   $126.0 million   in certain limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships that will be included in Other Equity Interests when funded.

  The valuation of assets measured at fair value in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2015   is summarized below.   

  The Company s investments in Fixed Maturities that are classified as Level 1 in the two preceding tables primarily consist of U.S. Treasury Bonds and Notes. The Company s investments in Equity Securities that are classified as Level 1 in the two preceding tables consist of either investments in publicly-traded common stocks or exchange traded funds. The Company s investments in Fixed Maturities that are classified as Level 2 in the two preceding tables primarily consist of investments in corporate bonds, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and bonds and mortgage-backed securities of U.S. government agencies.

Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements (continued) 
  consist of investments in preferred stocks. The Company uses a leading, nationally recognized provider of market data and analytics to price the vast majority of the Company s Level 2 measurements. The provider utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. Because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis, the provider s evaluated pricing applications apply available information through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing to prepare evaluations. In addition, the provider uses model processes to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios. The pricing provider s models and processes also take into account market convention. For each asset class, teams of its evaluators gather information from market sources and integrate relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news into the evaluated pricing applications and models. The Company generally validates the measurements obtained from its primary pricing provider by comparing them with measurements obtained from one additional pricing provider that provides either prices from recent market transactions, quotes in inactive markets or evaluations based on its own proprietary models. 
  The Company investigates significant differences related to the values provided. On completion of its investigation, management exercises judgment to determine the price selected and whether adjustments, if any, to the price obtained from the Company s primary pricing provider would warrant classification of the price as Level 3. In instances where a measurement cannot be obtained from either pricing provider, the Company generally will evaluate bid prices from one or more binding quotes obtained from market makers to value investments in inactive markets and classified by the Company as Level 2. The Company generally classifies securities when it receives non-binding quotes or indications as Level 3 securities unless the Company can validate the quote or indication against recent transactions in the market.  
  The Company s Investments in Fixed Maturities that are classified as Level 3 in the two preceding tables primarily consist of privately placed securities not rated by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization and are priced primarily using a market yield approach. A market yield approach uses a risk-free rate plus a credit spread depending on the underlying credit profile of the security. For floating rate securities, the risk-free rate used in the market yield is the contractual floating rate of the security. For each individual security, the Company or the Company s third party appraiser gathers information from market sources, relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news and determines an appropriate market yield for each security. The market yield selected is then used to discount the estimated future cash flows of the security to determine the fair value. The Company separately evaluates market yields based upon asset class to assess the reasonableness of the recorded fair value. For non-investment-grade Investments in Fixed Maturities that are classified as Level 3, the two primary asset classes are senior debt and junior debt. Senior debt includes those securities that receive first priority in a liquidation and junior debt includes any fixed maturity security with other than first priority in a liquidation.  
  The table below presents quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs utilized by the Company in determining fair values for fixed maturity investments in corporate securities classified as Level 3 at   September 30, 2016  .

  The table below presents quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs utilized by the Company in determining fair values for fixed maturity investments in corporate securities classified as Level 3 at   December 31, 2015  .   

  For an investment in a fixed maturity security, an increase in the yield used to determine the fair value of the security will decrease the fair value of the security. A decrease in the yield used to determine fair value will increase the fair value of the security, but the fair value increase is generally limited to par, unless callable at a premium, if the security is currently callable. 
  The Company s other investments that are classified as Level 3 primarily consist of Limited Liability Companies and Limited Partnerships, but also certain Preferred Stocks and Common Stocks. The Company either uses valuations provided by third party fund managers or third party appraisers, or that are generated internally. These valuations typically employ various valuation techniques commonly used in the industry, including earnings multiples based on comparable public securities, industry-specific non-earnings based multiples, market yields based on comparable public securities and discounted cash flow models.

Note 12 - Contingencies 
  In the ordinary course of its businesses, the Company is involved in legal proceedings, including lawsuits, regulatory examinations, audits and inquiries. Except with regard to the matters discussed below, based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that any of its pending legal proceedings will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  Over the last several years there have been an array of initiatives that seek, in various ways, to impose new duties on life insurance companies to proactively search for deaths of their insureds. These initiatives, which can include legislation, unclaimed property audits, market conduct examinations and related litigation, could have the effect of altering the terms of Kemper s life insurance subsidiaries  existing life insurance contracts by imposing requirements that did not exist and were not contemplated at the time those companies entered into such contracts. 
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company voluntarily began implementing a comprehensive process to compare life insurance records against one or more death verification databases to determine if any of its insureds may be deceased. See Note 1,  Basis of Presentation,  to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the estimated financial impact of such voluntary action recognized in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Any attempt to estimate the ultimate outcomes of the aforementioned initiatives entails uncertainties including, but not limited to (i) the scope and interpretation of DMF statutes, including the matching criteria and methodologies to be used in comparing policy records against a DMF, (ii) the universe of policies affected, (iii) the results of audits, examinations and other actions by regulators and (iv) related litigation. 
   
  Note 13 - Related Parties 
  Mr. Christopher B. Sarofim, a director of Kemper, is Vice Chairman and a member of the board of directors of Fayez Sarofim   Co. ( FS C ), a registered investment advisory firm. FS C provided investment management services with respect to certain assets of Kemper s subsidiary, Trinity, under an agreement between the parties. During the second quarter of 2015, Trinity disposed of all the assets managed by FS C. Investment expenses incurred in connection with such agreement were   $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The Company s defined benefit pension plan had   $146.6 million   in assets managed by FS C at   September 30, 2016   under an agreement with FS C whereby FS C provides investment management services with respect to certain funds of the plan. Investment expenses incurred in connection with such agreement were   $0.3 million   for each of the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  The Company believes that the services described above have been provided on terms no less favorable to the Company than could have been negotiated with non-affiliated third parties.

  Summary of Results 
  Net Income (Loss) 
  Net Loss was   $14.4 million   (  $0.27   per unrestricted common share) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to Net Income of   $81.1 million   (  $1.56   per unrestricted common share) for the same period in   2015  . Net Loss was   $16.3 million   (  $0.32   per unrestricted common share) for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to Net Income of   $37.9 million   (  $0.73   per unrestricted common share) for the same period in   2015  . 
  Loss from Continuing Operations was   $16.4 million   (  $0.31   per unrestricted common share) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to Income from Continuing Operations of   $78.9 million   (  $1.52   per unrestricted common share) for the same period in   2015  . Loss from Continuing Operations was   $18.3 million   (  $0.36   per unrestricted common share) for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to Income from Continuing Operations of   $38.0 million   (  $0.73   per unrestricted common share) for the same period in   2015  . 
  A reconciliation of Segment Net Operating Income (Loss) to Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) (a non-GAAP financial measure) and to Net Income (Loss) for the   nine and three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented below.   

  Revenues 
  Earned Premiums were   $1,658.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1,468.1 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $190.5 million  . Earned Premiums for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased by   $182.6 million   and   $7.9 million   in the Property   Casualty Insurance segment and Life   Health Insurance segment, respectively. See    Property   Casualty Insurance    and    Life   Health Insurance    for discussion of the changes in each segment s earned premiums.  
  Earned Premiums were   $558.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $536.7 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $22.2 million  . Earned Premiums for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     increased   by   $20.8 million   and   $1.4 million   in the Property   Casualty Insurance segment and Life   Health Insurance segment, respectively. 
  Net Investment Income   decreased   by   $4.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to lower investment returns from Alternative Investments, lower yields on investments in fixed income securities and lower level of investments in equity securities excluding alternative investments, partially offset by a higher level of investments in fixed income securities.

Summary of Results (continued) 
  Method Limited Liability Investments, Fair Value Option Investments and other limited liability investments included in Equity Securities decreased by   $8.7 million  . Alternative investment income from Equity Method Limited Liability Investments and Fair Value Option Investments   decreased   by   $8.1 million   and   $5.7 million  , respectively, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , while alternative investment income from other limited liability investments included in Equity Securities   increased   by   $5.1 million  .  
  Net Investment Income   increased   by   $1.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to higher levels and higher yields of investments in fixed income securities, partially offset by lower investment returns from Alternative Investments. Alternative investment income from Equity Method Limited Liability Investments and Fair Value Option Investments   decreased   by   $3.1 million  , and   $0.5 million   respectively, for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   while alternative investment income from other limited liability investments included in Equity Securities   increased   by   $2.7 million  . See    Investment Results    under the sub-caption    Net Investment Income    for additional discussion.  
  Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments were   $24.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $42.7 million   for the same period in   2015  . Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments were   $11.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $5.3 million   for the same period in   2015  .  
  Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings were   $24.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $12.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings were   $8.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.3 million   for the same period in   2015  . See    Investment Results    under the sub-captions    Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments    and    Net Impairment Losses   Recognized   in   Earnings    for additional discussion. The Company cannot predict if or when similar investment gains or losses may occur in the future. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Underlying Losses and LAE and Underlying Combined Ratio 
  The following discussion for the Property   Casualty Insurance segment uses the non-GAAP financial measures of (i) Underlying Losses and LAE and (ii) Underlying Combined Ratio. Underlying Losses and LAE (also referred to in the discussion as  Current Year Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE ) exclude the impact of catastrophe losses, and loss and LAE reserve development from prior years from the Company s Incurred Losses and LAE, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Underlying Combined Ratio is computed by adding the Current Year Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE Ratio with the Insurance Expense (including write-off of long-lived asset) Ratio. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the Combined Ratio, which is computed by adding total incurred losses and LAE, including the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and LAE reserve development from prior years, with the Insurance Expense (including write-off of long-lived asset) Ratio.  
  The Company believes Underlying Losses and LAE and the Underlying Combined Ratio are useful to investors and uses these financial measures to reveal the trends in the Company s Property   Casualty Insurance segment that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development. These catastrophe losses may cause the Company s loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on incurred losses and LAE and the combined ratio. Prior-year reserve developments are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves. Because reserve development relates to the re-estimation of losses from earlier periods, it has no bearing on the performance of the Company s insurance products in the current period. The Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company s underwriting performance.  
  Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) 
  Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) is an after-tax, non-GAAP financial measure and is computed by excluding from Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations the after-tax impact of: 
           (i) 
    Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments; 
              (ii) 
    Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings related to investments;  
              (iii) 
    Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt; and 
              (iv) 
    Significant non-recurring or infrequent items that may not be indicative of ongoing operations.  
     
   34 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures (continued) 
  Significant non-recurring items are excluded when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years and (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations. There were no applicable significant non-recurring items that the Company excluded from the calculation of Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) for the   nine and three months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
  The Company believes that Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) provides investors with a valuable measure of its ongoing performance because it reveals underlying operational performance trends that otherwise might be less apparent if the items were not excluded. Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments and Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings related to investments included in the Company s results may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions that impact the values of the Company s investments, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt is driven by the Company s financing and refinancing decisions and capital needs, as well as external economic developments such as debt market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Significant non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of the Company s business or economic trends. 
  The preceding non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for the comparable GAAP financial measures, as they do not fully recognize the overall profitability of the Company s businesses.

  Acquisition of Alliance United 
  As discussed in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company completed its acquisition of Alliance United on April 30, 2015. Alliance United is a provider of nonstandard personal automobile insurance in California and has added significant scale to the Property   Casualty Insurance segment s premium base. The results of Alliance United s operations have been included in the Company s consolidated results since the date of its acquisition, which can obscure certain comparisons of year-to-date results, particularly when analyzing overall segment results as well as the nonstandard personal automobile insurance line of business. To focus on the performance of the segment s legacy business, certain comparisons exclude Alliance United s impact on the segment s results.  
  
   37 

Property   Casualty Insurance (continued) 
  Overall 
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to the Same Period in   2015 
  The Property   Casualty Insurance segment reported Segment Net Operating Loss of   $9.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to Segment Net Operating Income of   $31.8 million   for the same period in   2015  . Segment net operating results deteriorated by   $41.7 million   due primarily to higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and net operating losses from Alliance United in 2016, partially offset by lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums in the legacy business and the write-off of internal-use software in 2015.  
  Earned Premiums in the Property   Casualty Insurance segment   increased   by   $182.6 million  . Excluding the impact from Alliance United, Earned Premiums   decreased   by   $32.5 million  , as lower volume accounted for a decrease of $39.8 million, while higher average earned premium accounted for an increase of $7.3 million. The lower volume was driven primarily by preferred personal automobile insurance and homeowners insurance, which had volume decreases of $19.8 million and $9.3 million, respectively. The increase in average earned premium was driven primarily by nonstandard personal automobile insurance, which had an increase of $10.7 million, partially offset by decreases in preferred personal automobile insurance and homeowners insurance of $3.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively. 
  Net Investment Income in the Property   Casualty Insurance segment   increased   by   $0.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to investment income from the investments acquired from the acquisition of, and the capital contributed to, Alliance United and higher yields on non-alternative investments, partially offset by lower investment income from Alternative Investments and a lower level of non-alternative investments. The Property   Casualty Insurance segment reported Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments of $13.3 million in   2016  , compared to $16.6 million in   2015  . 
  Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were   75.7%   in   2016  , a deterioration of   4.6   percentage points, compared to   2015  . Underlying losses and LAE exclude the impact of catastrophes and loss and LAE reserve development. Alliance United, which runs at a higher underlying losses and LAE ratio but lower insurance expense ratio, added 9.3 percentage points to the overall underlying losses and LAE ratio. Excluding the impact of Alliance United, underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were   66.4%   in   2016  , compared to   68.0%   in   2015  , or an improvement of   1.6   percentage points, as nonstandard personal automobile insurance, homeowners insurance, commercial automobile and other personal insurance improved while preferred personal automobile insurance deteriorated. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were   $97.9 million   in   2016  , compared to   $50.4 million   in   2015  , which is an increase of   $47.5 million   due primarily to two separate hailstorms in Texas one in March 2016 with estimated losses and LAE of $32.0 million and another in April 2016 with estimated losses and LAE of $24.4 million. The increase was partially offset by reduced severity of catastrophic events with losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) of less than $10 million in 2016, compared to 2015. Favorable loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was   $17.5 million   in   2016  , compared to   $13.8 million   in   2015  . 
  Insurance expenses were   $288.8 million  , or   24.0%   of earned premiums, in   2016  . Excluding a write-off of a long-lived asset, insurance expenses were   $265.8 million  , or   26.0%   of earned premiums, in   2015  . The improvement in the ratio of 2.0 percentage points from 2015 to 2016 was due primarily to the inclusion of Alliance United, which runs at a lower insurance expense ratio, for a full nine months in 2016. Excluding the impact of the write-off and Alliance United, insurance expenses decreased by $11.1 million in   2016  , compared to   2015  , and decreased as a percentage of earned premiums from 28.5% in   2015   to 28.3% in   2016  .  
  The Property   Casualty Insurance segment s effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to tax-exempt investment income, dividends received deductions and estimated indemnification recoveries recognized in earnings pursuant to the Alliance United purchase agreement. Tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions were   $16.8 million   in both   2016   and   2015  . Indemnification recoveries result in an adjustment to the tax purchase price and are excluded from the determination of taxable income and income tax expense. Estimated indemnification recoveries recognized in earnings were $0.7 million in   2016  , all of which has been reported as a reduction of Insurance Expenses. Estimated indemnification recoveries recognized in earnings were $10.4 million in   2015  , of which $5.9 million has been reported as a reduction of Incurred Losses and LAE and $4.5 million has been recorded as a reduction of Insurance Expenses.

Property   Casualty Insurance (continued) 
  Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to the Same Period in   2015 
  The Property   Casualty Insurance segment reported Segment Net Operating Income of   $12.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $21.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . Segment net operating results deteriorated by   $8.9 million   due primarily to net operating losses from Alliance United in 2016, higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and a lower level of favorable loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums in the legacy business and higher net investment income.  
  Earned Premiums in the Property   Casualty Insurance segment   increased   by   $20.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  . Earned Premiums in the Alliance United business   increased   by   $30.4 million  , as higher volume and average earned premium accounted for increases of $24.4 million and $6.0 million, respectively. Excluding the impact of Alliance United, Earned Premiums   decreased   by   $9.6 million  , as lower volume accounted for a decrease of $13.1 million, while higher average earned premium accounted for an increase of $3.5 million. Excluding Alliance United, the lower volume was driven primarily by preferred personal automobile insurance, nonstandard personal automobile insurance and homeowners insurance, which had volume decreases of $4.6 million, $3.9 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Excluding Alliance United, the increase in average earned premium was driven primarily by nonstandard personal automobile insurance, which had an increase of $3.8 million. 
  Net Investment Income in the Property   Casualty Insurance segment   increased   by   $2.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to higher yields on non-alternative investments. The Property   Casualty Insurance segment reported Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments of $7.2 million in both   2016   and   2015  . 
  Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were   75.4%   in   2016  , a deterioration of   2.1   percentage points, compared to   2015  . Alliance United, which runs at a higher underlying losses and LAE ratio, but lower insurance expense ratio, added 9.0 percentage points to the overall underlying losses and LAE ratio. Excluding the impact of Alliance United, underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were   66.4%   in   2016  , compared to   68.0%  , an improvement of   1.6   percentage points, compared to   2015  , as nonstandard personal automobile insurance and commercial automobile insurance improved, while homeowners insurance, preferred personal automobile insurance and other personal insurance deteriorated. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were   $11.3 million   in   2016  , compared to   $4.7 million   in   2015  , which was an abnormally low quarter for catastrophe losses and LAE. The increase of   $6.6 million   was due primarily to intra-year development on first and second quarter losses and a higher frequency of catastrophic events. Favorable loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was   $0.8 million   in   2016  , compared to   $2.8 million   in   2015  .  
  Insurance expenses were   $94.6 million  , or   23.2%   of earned premiums, in   2016  , compared to   $94.4 million  , or   24.4%   of earned premiums, in   2015  . The improvement in the ratio of   1.2   percentage points from 2015 to 2016 was due primarily to growth in the Alliance United business, which runs at a lower insurance expense ratio than the legacy business. Excluding the impact of Alliance United, insurance expenses   decreased   by   $3.1 million   in   2016  , compared to   2015  , and   decreased   as a percentage of earned premiums from   28.5%   in   2015   to   28.4%   in   2016  .  
  The Property   Casualty Insurance segment s effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions and estimated indemnification recoveries recognized in earnings pursuant to the Alliance United purchase agreement. Tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions were   $5.2 million   in both   2016   and   2015  . Estimated indemnification recoveries recognized in earnings were $7.9 million in   2015  , of which $3.4 million has been reported as a reduction of Incurred Losses and LAE and $4.5 million has been recorded as a reduction of Insurance Expenses.

  Selected financial information for the preferred personal automobile insurance product line follows. 

Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to the Same Period in   2015 
  Earned Premiums on preferred personal automobile insurance   decreased   by   $22.9 million   as lower volume and lower average earned premium accounted for decreases of $19.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The run-off of the direct-to-consumer business accounted for over half of the decrease in earned premiums attributed to lower volume. The decrease in average earned premium was due primarily to a mix shift toward lower risk drivers, partially offset by rate increases. Incurred losses and LAE were   $234.1 million  , or   73.6%   of earned premiums, in   2016  , compared to   $224.8 million  , or   65.9%   of earned premiums, in   2015  . Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums   increased   due primarily to an unfavorable change in loss and LAE reserve development and higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and, to a lesser extent, higher underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums. Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums were   69.8%   in   2016  , compared to   69.3%   in   2015  , which is a deterioration of   0.5   percentage points due primarily to slightly higher severity of losses on most coverages. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were   $11.3 million   in   2016  , compared to   $2.6 million   in   2015  , due primarily to the two aforementioned hailstorms in Texas in 2016. Loss and LAE reserve development was adverse by   $0.5 million   in   2016  , compared to favorable development of   $14.2 million   in   2015  .  
  Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to the Same Period in   2015 
  Earned Premiums on preferred personal automobile insurance   decreased   by   $5.0 million   as lower volume and lower average earned premium accounted for decreases of $4.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The run-off of the direct-to-consumer business accounted for approximately 70% of the decrease in earned premiums attributed to lower volume. The decrease in average earned premium was due primarily to a mix shift toward lower risk drivers, partially offset by rate increases. Incurred losses and LAE were   $74.8 million  , or   70.2%   of earned premiums, in   2016  , compared to   $73.8 million  , or   66.1%   of earned premiums, in   2015  . Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums   increased   due to a lower level of favorable loss and LAE reserve development, higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and higher underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums. Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums were   69.5%   in   2016  , compared to   68.5%   in   2015  , which is a deterioration of   1.0   percentage point due primarily to slightly higher severity of bodily injury losses and frequency of bodily injury claims. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding

  reserve development) were   $1.2 million   in   2016  , compared to   $0.1 million   in   2015  . Favorable loss and LAE reserve development was   $0.4 million   in   2016  , compared to   $2.8 million   in   2015  .  
  Nonstandard Personal Automobile Insurance 
  Selected financial information for the nonstandard personal automobile insurance product line for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented in the following table. The results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   for Alliance United include only the last five months of the period, which is the period since the date of acquisition. 

Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to the Same Period in   2015 
  Earned Premiums on nonstandard personal automobile insurance   increased   by   $219.4 million  . Excluding the impact from Alliance United, Earned Premiums   increased   by   $4.3 million   as higher average earned premium accounted for an increase of $10.7 million, while lower volume accounted for a decrease of $6.4 million. Incurred losses and LAE were   $552.6 million  , or   90.7%   of earned premiums, in   2016  , compared to   $338.4 million  , or   86.8%   of earned premiums, in   2015  . Excluding Alliance United, incurred losses and LAE were   $185.1 million  , or   79.6%   of related earned premiums, in   2016  , compared to   $194.2 million  , or   85.1%   of related earned premiums, in   2015  . Excluding the impact of Alliance United, incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums   decreased   due to lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums and a lower level of adverse loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development). Excluding Alliance United, underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums were   76.2%   in   2016  , compared to   81.2%   in   2015  , which is an improvement of   5.0   percentage points due primarily to higher average earned premium, lower severity of liability losses on California policies and lower frequency of claims across most coverages on non-California policies, partially offset by higher frequency of claims on all coverages on California policies. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were   $5.8 million   in   2016  , compared to   $3.2 million   in   2015  . Excluding Alliance United, adverse loss and LAE reserve development was   $2.0 million   in   2016  , compared to   $5.5 million   in   2015  .

Property   Casualty Insurance (continued) 
  For Alliance United, underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums were   96.2%   in   2016  , compared to   87.3%   in   2015  , which is a deterioration of   8.9   percentage points. Alliance United s underlying loss and LAE ratio continues to be significantly higher than what had been reported by Alliance United prior to the acquisition date. Alliance United has experienced significantly higher frequency of claims on all coverages and, to a lesser extent, higher severity of losses on most coverages than the trend that Kemper had anticipated prior to the acquisition. Alliance United s premium rates have become inadequate due in part to the significant adverse changes in underlying frequency and severity trends. The Company continues to analyze its experience against industry information as it becomes available and believes that Alliance United s frequency trend may be worse than industry due in part to anti-selection resulting from inadequate rates and higher growth rates for new business, which tends to run at a higher underlying loss and LAE ratio than renewal business. In addition, Alliance United s results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   include adverse loss and LAE reserve development of   $4.8 million  . Since the acquisition, several events have resulted in the historical development factors becoming less reliable in predicting how losses will ultimately emerge. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the primary driver of adverse development was a decrease in the ratio of claims closed without payment, which has driven the Company s selection of ultimate losses higher. In addition, payment development patterns, as well as claim severity patterns, may have been influenced by an inadequate level of claims adjusters, as staffing levels for Alliance United s claims adjusters were not able to keep pace with Alliance United s growth rate prior to and after the acquisition date and the recent spike in frequency. The Company has taken and continues to take various actions to address Alliance United s performance, including increasing the staffing levels for claims adjusters, slowing growth rates for new business, various agency management actions and filing and implementing rate increases. The Company anticipates it will take several more pricing cycles to become rate adequate.

  Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to the Same Period in   2015 
  Earned Premiums on nonstandard personal automobile insurance   increased   by   $30.3 million  . Excluding the impact from Alliance United, Earned Premiums were fairly flat compared to prior year as lower volume, which accounted for a decrease of $3.9 million, was largely offset by higher average earned premium, which accounted for an increase of $3.8 million. Incurred losses and LAE were   $183.5 million  , or   88.6%   of earned premiums, in   2016  , compared to   $155.0 million  , or   87.6%   of earned premiums, in   2015  . Excluding Alliance United, incurred losses and LAE were   $61.8 million  , or   80.1%   of related earned premiums, in   2016  , compared to   $64.6 million  , or   83.6%   of earned premiums, in   2015  . Excluding the impact of Alliance United, incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums   decreased   due to lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums, partially offset by higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and a higher level of adverse loss and LAE reserve development. Excluding Alliance United, underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums were   73.6%   in   2016  , compared to   81.3%   in   2015  , which is an improvement of   7.7   percentage points due primarily to higher average earned premium, lower frequency of claims across most coverages on non-California policies, lower severity of losses across all coverages except bodily injury and intra-year development on first and second quarter claims, partially offset by higher frequency of claims on all coverages on California policies and higher severity of bodily injury losses. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were   $1.8 million   in   2016  , compared to none in   2015  . Excluding Alliance United, adverse loss and LAE reserve development was   $3.3 million   in   2016  , compared to   $1.8 million   in   2015  .  
  For Alliance United, Earned Premiums   increased   by   $30.4 million   as higher volume and higher average earned premium accounted for increases of $24.4 million and $6.0 million, respectively. Alliance United s underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums were   94.5%   in   2016  , compared to   89.0%   in   2015  , which is a deterioration of   5.5   percentage points due primarily to rate increases not keeping pace with the frequency and severity trends previously noted. Alliance United s loss and LAE reserve development was favorable by   $1.3 million   in   2016  , compared to adverse development of   $1.8 million   in   2015  .

Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums   increased   due to higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development), partially offset by a higher level of favorable loss and LAE reserve development and lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums. Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were   50.4%   in   2016  , compared to   52.1%   in   2015  , which is an improvement of   1.7   percentage points due primarily to lower frequency of claims, partially offset by higher severity of losses and lower average earned premium. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were   $77.7 million   in   2016  , compared to   $42.8 million   in   2015  . This increase was driven primarily by the two aforementioned hailstorms in Texas in 2016.

Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums   increased   due primarily to higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and higher underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums. Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were   53.7%   in   2016  , compared to   50.4%   in   2015  , which is a deterioration of   3.3   percentage points due primarily to intra-year development on first and second quarter claims, and, to a lesser extent, higher frequency of claims and lower average earned premium, partially offset by lower severity of losses. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were   $7.8 million   in   2016  , compared to   $4.8 million   in   2015  . This increase was due primarily to intra-year development on first and second quarter losses and a higher frequency of catastrophic events.

  Overall 
  Use of Death Verification Databases 
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company s Life   Health segment voluntarily began implementing a comprehensive process under which it will cross-reference its life insurance policies against the DMF and other death verification databases to identify potential situations where the beneficiaries may not have filed a claim following the death of an insured and initiate an outreach process to identify and contact beneficiaries and settle claims. Policyholders  Benefits and Incurred Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 include a pre-tax charge of $77.8 million to recognize the impact of using death verification databases in the Company s operations, including to determine its IBNR liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses for life insurance products. 
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to the Same Period in   2015 
  Earned Premiums in the Life   Health Insurance segment   increased   by   $7.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   due primarily to an adjustment of $7.6 million recorded in the first quarter of   2015   to correct deferred premium reserves on certain limited pay life insurance policies.  
  Net Investment Income   increased   by   $0.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, due primarily to higher levels of investments in non-alternative investments and higher investment returns from Alternative Investments, partially offset by lower yields on investments in fixed income securities. 
  Policyholders  Benefits and Incurred Losses and LAE   increased   by   $81.0 million   in   2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  . Excluding the impact of using death verification databases described above, Policyholders  Benefits and Incurred Losses and LAE increased by $3.2 million, due primarily to higher policyholders  benefits on life insurance and incurred losses and LAE on property insurance. Insurance Expenses in the Life   Health Insurance segment   decreased   by   $0.5 million   due primarily to lower legal costs, partially offset by higher agent and field management compensation costs for the Kemper Home Service Companies ( KHSC ) and the impact of an adjustment made in   2015   to deferred policy acquisition costs for Reserve

  Trinity and United Insurance are members of the FHLB of Dallas and Chicago, respectively. During the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , Trinity borrowed and repaid   $10.0 million   and   $20.5 million  , respectively, under its agreement with the FHLB of Dallas.

There were no advances from the FHLB of Dallas or Chicago outstanding at either   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  On February 24, 2015, Kemper issued   $250.0 million   of its   4.35%   senior notes due February 15, 2025. The net proceeds of the issuance were   $247.3 million  , net of discount and transaction costs. Kemper used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2025 Senior Notes, together with available cash, to redeem in full the   $250.0 million   outstanding principal amount of its 6.00% Senior Notes due November 30, 2015. Kemper recognized a loss of   $9.1 million   before income taxes in the first quarter of 2015 from the early redemption of these senior notes. 
  Subsidiary Dividends and Capital Contributions 
  Various state insurance laws restrict the ability of Kemper s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends without regulatory approval. Such insurance laws generally restrict the amount of dividends paid in an annual period to the greater of statutory net income from the previous year or 10% of statutory capital and surplus. Kemper s direct insurance subsidiaries paid dividends of   $74.8 million   to Kemper during the first   nine   months of   2016  .

  regulatory approval. During the first   nine   months of   2016  , Kemper contributed $45 million of additional capital to Alliance United.  
  Common Stock Repurchases and Dividends to Shareholders 
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , Kemper repurchased   0.1 million   shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of   $3.8 million   in open market transactions.  
  Kemper paid a quarterly dividend to shareholders of   $0.24   per common share in each of the first three quarters of   2016  . Dividends and dividend equivalents paid were   $36.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Sources of Funds 
  Kemper directly held cash and investments totaling   $310.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $341.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  Sources available for the repayment of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock, future shareholder dividend payments and the payment of interest on Kemper s senior notes and subordinated debentures include cash and investments directly held by Kemper, receipt of dividends from Kemper s insurance subsidiaries and borrowings under the credit agreement.  
  The primary sources of funds for Kemper s insurance subsidiaries are premiums, investment income and proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments, advances from the FHLBs of Dallas and Chicago, and capital contributions from Kemper. The primary uses of funds are the payment of policyholder benefits under life insurance contracts, claims under property and casualty insurance contracts and accident and health insurance contracts, the payment of commissions and general expenses, the purchase of investments and repayments of advances from the FHLBs of Dallas and Chicago. Generally, there is a time lag between when premiums are collected and when policyholder benefits and insurance claims are paid. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company s Life   Health segment voluntarily began implementing a comprehensive process under which it will cross-reference its life insurance policies against the DMF and other death verification databases to identify potential situations where the beneficiaries may not have filed a claim following the death of an insured and initiate an outreach process to identify and contact beneficiaries and settle claims. The Company expects to pay approximately $80 million in claims over the next several years to complete the initial outreach process. During periods of growth, insurance companies typically experience positive operating cash flows and are able to invest a portion of their operating cash flows to fund future policyholder benefits and claims. During periods in which premium revenues decline, insurance companies may experience negative cash flows from operations and may need to sell investments to fund payments to policyholders and     claimants. In addition, if the Company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries experience several significant catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time, investments may have to be sold in advance of their maturity dates to fund payments, which could result in either investment gains or losses. Management believes that its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries maintain adequate levels of liquidity in the event that they were to experience several future catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time.

Purchases of Corporate-owned Life Insurance was   $7.5 million   for both the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
   
  Critical Accounting Estimates 
  Kemper s subsidiaries conduct their operations in two industries: property and casualty insurance and life and health insurance. Accordingly, the Company is subject to several industry-specific accounting principles under GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The process of estimation is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results could ultimately differ materially from the estimated amounts reported in a company s financial statements. Different assumptions are likely to result in different estimates of reported amounts. 
  The Company s critical accounting policies most sensitive to estimates include the valuation of investments, the valuation of reserves for property and casualty insurance incurred losses and LAE, the assessment of recoverability of goodwill, the valuation of pension benefit obligations and the valuation of postretirement benefit obligations other than pensions. The Company s critical accounting policies are described in the MD A included in the   2015   Annual Report. There has been no material change, subsequent to   December 31, 2015  , to the information previously disclosed in the   2015   Annual Report with respect to these critical accounting estimates and the Company s critical accounting policies.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Company is required to provide the following disclosures about Market Risk. 
   
  Quantitative Information About Market Risk 
  Financial instruments subject to material market risk disclosures required by the SEC were reported on the following lines of the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: 
           1) 
     Investments in Fixed Maturities; 
              2) 
     Investments in Equity Securities; 
              3) 
     Fair Value Option Investments; and 
      Investments in Fixed Maturities and Debt are subject to material interest rate risk. The Company s Investments in Equity Securities include common and preferred stocks and, accordingly, are subject to material equity price risk and interest rate risk, respectively. The Company s Fair Value Option Investments include hedge funds that are subject to material equity price risk. 
  For purposes of this disclosure, market risk sensitive financial instruments are divided into two categories: financial instruments acquired for trading purposes and financial instruments acquired for purposes other than trading. The Company s market risk sensitive financial instruments are generally classified as held for purposes other than trading. The Company has no significant holdings of financial instruments acquired for trading purposes. The Company has no significant holdings of derivatives. 
  The Company measures its sensitivity to market risk by evaluating the change in its financial assets and liabilities relative to fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices. The evaluation is made using instantaneous changes in interest rates and equity prices on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such changes would have on the Company s market value at risk and the resulting pre-tax effect on Shareholders  Equity. The changes chosen represent the Company s view of adverse changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. The selection of the changes chosen should not be construed as the Company s prediction of future market events, but rather an illustration of the impact of such possible events. 
  For the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below, the Company assumed an adverse and instantaneous increase of 100 basis points in the yield curve at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for Investments in Fixed Maturities. Such 100 basis point increase in the yield curve may not necessarily result in a corresponding 100 basis point increase in the interest rate for all investments in fixed maturities. For example, a 100 basis point increase in the yield curve for risk-free, taxable investments in fixed maturities may not result in a 100 basis point increase for tax-exempt investments in fixed maturities. For Investments in Fixed Maturities, the Company also anticipated changes in cash flows due to changes in the likelihood that investments would be called or pre-paid prior to their contractual maturity. All other variables were held constant. For preferred stock equity securities, the Company assumed an adverse and instantaneous increase of 100 basis points in market interest rates from their levels at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . All other variables were held constant. For Debt, the Company assumed an adverse and instantaneous decrease of 100 basis points in market interest rates from their levels at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . All other variables were held constant.  
  The Company measured equity price sensitivity assuming an adverse and instantaneous 30% decrease in the Standard and Poor s Stock Index (the  S P 500 ) from its levels at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, with all other variables held constant. The Company s investments in common stock equity securities were correlated with the S P 500 using the common stock portfolio s weighted-average beta of   1.00   and   0.99   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Beta measures a stock s relative volatility in relation to the rest of the stock market, with the S P 500 having a beta coefficient of 1.00. The common stock portfolio s weighted-average beta was calculated using each security s beta for the five-year periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and weighted on the fair value of such securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. For equity securities without observable market inputs, the Company assumed a beta of 1.00 at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Company s Fair Value Option Investments were correlated with the S P 500 using such portfolio s weighted-average beta of   0.08   and   0.14   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which was calculated for each hedge fund in the portfolio and weighted on the fair value of the hedge funds. 
  
   59 

The estimated adverse effects on the fair values of the Company s financial instruments using these assumptions were:   

  The market risk sensitivity analysis assumes that the composition of the Company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, including, but not limited to, credit quality, and the equity price sensitive assets existing at the beginning of the period remains constant over the period being measured. It also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is uniform across the yield curve regardless of the time to maturity. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Also, any future correlation, either in the near term or the long term, between the Company s common stock equity securities portfolio and the S P 500 may differ from the historical correlation as represented by the weighted-average historical beta of the common stock equity securities portfolio. Accordingly, the market risk sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide, a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market rates on the Company s income or shareholders  equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions the Company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates or equity prices. 
  To the extent that any adverse 100 basis point change occurs in increments over a period of time instead of instantaneously, the adverse impact on fair values would be partially mitigated because some of the underlying financial instruments would have matured. For example, proceeds from any maturing assets could be reinvested and any new liabilities would be incurred at the then current interest rates. 
   
  Qualitative Information About Market Risk 
  Market risk is a broad term related to economic losses due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument and is inherent to all financial instruments. SEC disclosure rules focus on only one element of market risk   -   price risk. Price risk relates to changes in the level of prices due to changes in interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates or other factors that relate to market volatility of the rate, index or price underlying the financial instrument. The Company s primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices. 
  The Company manages its interest rate exposures with respect to Investments in Fixed Maturities by investing primarily in investment-grade securities of moderate effective duration. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
           (a) 
    Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
     The Company s management, with the participation of Kemper s Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, Kemper s Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by Kemper in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,  
  
   60 

processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including Kemper s Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
           (b) 
    Changes in internal controls. 
     There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
  Items not listed here have been omitted because they are inapplicable or the answer is negative. 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  Information concerning pending legal proceedings is incorporated herein by reference to Note 12,  Contingencies,  to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I of this Form 10-Q. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors  
  Except as discussed below, there were no significant changes in the risk factors included in Item 1A. of Part I of the   2015   Annual Report. The first risk factor appearing in such Item 1A. of Part I of the   2015   Annual Report, which had been amended and restated in its entirety in Item 1A of Part II of Kemper s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for both the first and second quarters of 2016 is deleted in its entirety. The second risk factor appearing in such Item 1A. of Part I of the   2015   Annual Report is amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 
  Kemper s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation, and the evolving legal and regulatory landscape in which they operate could result in increased operating costs, reduced profitability and limited growth.  
  Kemper s insurance subsidiaries operate under an extensive insurance regulatory system. Current laws and regulations encompass a wide variety of matters, including policy forms, premium rates, licensing, market conduct, trade practices, claims practices, reserve and loss ratio requirements, investment standards, statutory capital and surplus requirements, restrictions on the payment of dividends, approvals of transactions involving a change in control of one or more insurance companies, restrictions on transactions among affiliates and consumer privacy. They also require the filing of annual and quarterly financial reports and holding company reports. Pre-approval requirements often restrict the companies from implementing premium rate changes for property, casualty and health insurance policies, introducing new, or making changes to existing, policy forms and many other actions. Insurance regulators conduct periodic examinations of Kemper s insurance subsidiaries and can suspend or delay their operations or licenses, require corrective actions, and impose penalties or other remedies available for compliance failures. For a more detailed discussion of the regulations applicable to Kemper s subsidiaries and these new developments, see  Regulation  in Item 1 of the   2015   Annual Report. 
  These laws and regulations, and their interpretation by the various regulators and courts, are undergoing continual revision and expansion. The legal and regulatory landscape within which Kemper s insurance subsidiaries conduct their businesses is often unpredictable. As industry practices and regulatory, judicial, political, social and other conditions change, issues may emerge, whether intended or not. These emerging practices, conditions and issues could adversely affect Kemper s insurance subsidiaries in a variety of ways, including, for example, by expansion of coverages beyond the underwriting intent, increasing the number or size of claims, accelerating the payment of claims or adding to operational costs. Industry practices that were once considered approved, compliant and reasonable may suddenly be deemed unacceptable by virtue of a court or regulatory ruling or changes in regulatory enforcement policies and practices. It is not possible for the Company to predict such shifts in legal or regulatory enforcement or to accurately estimate the impact they may have on the Company and its operations.  
  One area where the legal and regulatory landscape is experiencing significant change is in connection with the mandated use of death verification databases by life insurance companies in their policy administration and claims handling practices. In recent years, many states have adopted new laws requiring insurers to proactively use such databases, including the Social Security Administration s Death Master File, to varying degrees in order to ascertain if an insured may be deceased. More than twenty states have adopted such laws. Kemper cannot predict whether additional states will enact similar legislation or, if enacted, what form such legislation may take. These laws require the insurer to initiate the claims process even though the insureds  beneficiaries have not submitted a claim, including due proof of death, as required by regulator-approved policy forms and the insurer was otherwise unaware of the insured s death. In a related development, many states have expanded the application of their unclaimed property laws, particularly as they relate to life insurance proceeds, and the treasurers or controllers of a large  
  
   61 

number of states have engaged audit firms to examine the practices of life insurance companies with respect to the reporting and remittance of such proceeds under unclaimed property laws. The push to alter historic practices that were previously considered lawful and appropriate relative to both claims handling and remittance of life insurance policy proceeds under unclaimed property laws has caused the Company to be involved in compliance audits, market conduct examinations and litigation. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company voluntarily began implementing a comprehensive process to compare life insurance records against a DMF and other databases to determine if any of its insured may be deceased. See Note 1,  Basis of Presentation,  and Note 12,  Contingencies,  to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.  
  The financial services industry, including insurance companies and their holding company systems, remains under regulatory scrutiny. While it is not possible to predict how new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may impact the operations of Kemper s insurance subsidiaries, several developments have the potential to significantly impact such operations. This includes state adoption of extensive modifications to state holding company laws that substantially expand the oversight and examination powers of state insurance regulators beyond licensed insurance companies to their non-insurance affiliates and their organizations as a whole, particularly with respect to enterprise risk. In addition, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively the  Health Care Acts ) have resulted in regulations affecting health insurers such as Reserve National, and potential changes to the state insurance regulatory system may result from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank Act ). See the discussion of the Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the  NAIC model act ) and the Dodd-Frank Act under  Regulation  in Item 1 of the   2015   Annual Report. 
  These new developments and significant changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws and regulations could make it more expensive for Kemper s insurance subsidiaries to conduct and grow their businesses. 
   
  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds    
  Information pertaining to purchases of Kemper common stock for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   follows.   

  (1) On August 6, 2014, Kemper s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $300 million   of Kemper s common stock. See MD A,  Liquidity and Capital Resources.  
  Total Number of Shares Purchased in the preceding table include   2,715   shares that were withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted stock awards under Kemper s long-term equity-based compensation plans during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .

  (c)  Employee has been paid all wages, benefits, and other compensation owed to Employee by Employer through the Separation Date, subject to the obligation of Employer for the payment of: (i) salary at Employee s current base rate through the Separation Date;     ii) expense reimbursement reports that are outstanding on the date hereof or which are submitted hereafter pursuant to Section 15; (iii) all paid time off ( PTO ), if any, that will be accrued but unpaid on the Separation Date.  Any such accrued and  
  
   1 

unpaid PTO will be paid to Employee no later than the next regularly scheduled payday after the Separation Date; and (iv) any amounts potentially payable to Employee as a cash bonus for 2016 under the multi-year incentive award granted to Employee in 2014, for the 2014-2016 performance period, under the Kemper Corporation 2009 Performance Incentive Plan, in accordance with such plan and the agreements governing such awards to which employee is a party.
