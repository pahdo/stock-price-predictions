1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

A summary of the significant accounting
policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements follows: 

Business and Basis of Presentation  

Investview, Inc. (the  Company )
was incorporated on August 10, 2005 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Voxpath Holding, Inc. On September 16, 2006, the Company
changed its name to TheRetirementSolution.Com, Inc., on October 1, 2008 to Global Investor Services, Inc. and on March 27, 2012
to Investview, Inc. The Company currently markets directly and through its marketing partners as well as online, certain investor
products and services that provide financial and educational information to its prospective customers and to its subscribers. 

In August 2014, the Company formed Vickrey
Brown Investments, LLC, a limited liability company under the laws of California with 51% membership interests specializing in
investment strategies which combine quantitative strategies, forensic accounting and volatility controls. At formation, the minority
members paid an aggregate of $1,000 as equity contribution. The Company contributed $120,000 as equity contribution and is contingently
obligated to issue 500,000 shares of common stock upon achieving certain milestones (as defined). Prior to all distributions, the
Company is to receive 25% of all revenue generated until at which time the $120,000 equity contribution of the Company has been
paid. 

On December 27, 2015, the Company entered
into a Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement whereby the Company surrendered its equity ownership in Vickrey Brown Investments
LLC and transferred ownership of SAFE Management LLC ( Safe ) in exchange for 25% of all revenue generated by Vickrey
Brown Investments, LLC until an aggregate of $120,000 has been paid and 30.6% of remaining and future revenue. As such, the Company
reclassified operating activities of Vickrey Brown Investments, LLC and Safe to discontinued operations. 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Investment Tools   Training, LLC ( ITT )
and Razor Data Corp ( Razor ). All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Interim Financial Statements  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations (Regulation S-X) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the  SEC ) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The
results of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results
that may be expected for the year ended March 31, 2017. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the March 31, 2016 consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K. 

Revenue Recognition  

For revenue from product sales and services,
the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10, Revenue Recognition ( ASC
605-10 ) which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable;
and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding
the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts
and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related
sales are recorded. 

INVESTVIEW, INC.  

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

The Company defers any revenue for which
the product or services has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly
determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required. 

Revenue arises from subscriptions to the
websites/software, workshops, online workshops and training and coaching/counseling services where the customers are charged a
monthly subscription fee for access to the online training and courses and website/data.  Revenues are recognized in
the month the product and services are delivered. 

The Company sells its products separately
and in various bundles that include website/data subscriptions, educational workshops, online workshops and training, one-on-one
coaching and counseling sessions, along with other products and services. The deferral policy for each of the different types
of revenues is summarized as follows: 

Product   
       
       Recognition Policy    
 
      Live Workshops and Workshop Certificates  
       
      Deferred and recognized as the workshop is provided or certificate expires   

Online training and courses  
       
      Deferred and recognized a.) as the services are delivered, or b.) when usage thresholds are met, or c.) on a straight-line basis over the initial product period   

Coaching/Counseling services  
       
      Deferred and recognized as services are delivered, or on a straight-line basis over the life of the customer s contract   

Website/data fees (monthly)  
       
      Not deferred, recognized in the month delivered   

Website/data fees (pre-paid subscriptions)   
       
      Deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the subscription period   

Cost of Sales and Service  

The cost of sales and service consists
of the cost of the data feeds that supply twenty minute delayed stock market data to the Company s stock analysis software
based tool, external partner commissions and other costs associated with the repair or maintenance of the website. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of these unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

Fair value estimates discussed herein are
based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016 and March 31,
2016. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial
instruments include cash, notes payable, convertible notes payable, derivative liabilities and accounts payable. Fair values were
assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate
fair values or they are payable on demand. 

INVESTVIEW, INC.  

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

Reliance on Key Personnel and Consultants  

The Company is heavily dependent on the
continued active participation of these current executive officers, employees and key consultants. The loss of any of the senior
management or key consultants could significantly and negatively impact the business until adequate replacements can be identified
and put in place. 

Derivative Liability  

The Company accounts for derivatives in
accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives
on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the
derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated
are based on the exposures hedged. At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company did not have any derivative instruments
that were designated as hedges. See Note 8 for discussion of the Company s derivative liabilities. 

Net Loss per Share  

The Company follows Accounting Standards
Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260-10 ) specifying the computation, presentation and disclosure
requirements of earnings per share information. Basic loss per share has been calculated based upon the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding. Convertible debt, stock options and warrants have been excluded as common stock equivalents in the
diluted loss per share because their effect is anti-dilutive on the computation. In determining the discontinued operations fully
diluted earnings per share, the Company did not allocate any common stock equivalents, therefore the basic and fully diluted per
share amounts are the same. 

Potentially dilutive securities excluded
from the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share are as follows: 

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company accounts for its stock based
awards in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 718-10, Compensation ( ASC 718-10 ), which requires
a fair value measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to its employees and directors,
including employee stock options and restricted stock awards. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using
the Black-Scholes valuation model. This model requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions including, among other things,
estimates regarding the length of time an employee will retain vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility
of our common stock price and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to vesting. The fair value is then amortized on
a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. 

Changes in these estimates and assumptions
can materially affect the determination of the fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized
in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

For the six months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company did not grant stock options to employees.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

Segment Information  

Accounting Standards Codification subtopic
Segment Reporting 280-10 ( ASC 280-10 ) establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments
in annual financial statements and requires selected information for those segments to be presented in interim financial reports
issued to stockholders. ASC 280-10 also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services and geographic
areas. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is
available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions how to allocate resources
and assess performance. The information disclosed herein materially represents all of the financial information related to the
Company s only material principal operating segment after the discontinued operations of Instilend (See Note 11). 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

There are various updates recently issued,
most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not
expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

2. GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT S LIQUIDITY PLANS  

The Company s unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which
contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred
significant recurring losses which have resulted in an accumulated deficit of $101,631,459 and net loss of $1,009,671 for the six
months ended September 30, 2016 which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

During the six
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company raised $47,500 in cash proceeds from the issuance of notes.  The Company believes
that its current cash on hand will not be sufficient to fund its projected operating requirements currently. 

The Company's
primary source of operating funds since inception has been cash proceeds from the private placements of common stock and proceeds
from private placements of convertible and other debt.  The Company intends to raise additional capital through private placements
of debt and equity securities, but there can be no assurance that these funds will be available on terms acceptable to the Company,
or will be sufficient to enable the Company to fully complete its development activities or sustain operations. If the Company
is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables, reduce
overhead, or scale back its current business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations.
There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful. 

Accordingly, the
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern
and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values.
The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

3. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES  

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities
consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016: 

As of September 30, 2016 and March 31,
2016, accrued payroll taxes included the effects of an estimated payroll tax liability for stock based compensation issued to an
officer. 

4. SETTLEMENT PAYABLE  

On August 12, 2013, Evenflow Funding, LLC
( Evenflow ) commenced a civil action (the  NJ Action ) against the Company in the Superior Court of New
Jersey, Law Division, Monmouth County (the  Court ) bearing Docket No. Mon-L-3105-13 in collection of a promissory note
issued January 20, 2009 and related accrued interest. 

On October 13, 2014, the Company and Evenflow
agreed to a settlement and a Stipulation of Settlement (the  Settlement ) was filed with the Court, in connection with
the NJ Action. Pursuant to the Settlement, the Company agreed to pay to Evenflow a total of $425,000 (the  Settlement Amount )
in quarterly payments (the  Quarterly Payments ) equal to 10% of the net revenue (revenue less allowances, returns and
payments to revenue sharing agreements) of the Company as reported in the Company's periodic reports filed on Form 10-Q or Form
10-K (collectively, the  Periodic Reports ) commencing with the Company's December 31, 2014 Periodic Report. The Quarterly
Payments are due and payable by the Company on the tenth day following the filing of each Periodic Report. In addition to the Quarterly
Payments, the Company agreed to make an initial payment in the amount of $25,000 upon the filing of the Settlement with the Court,
as well as a payment in the amount of $25,000 due on the 12 month anniversary of the initial payment. The aggregate total of all
payments including the upfront $25,000, the one year anniversary $25,000, and the quarterly payments is to be $425,000. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company reclassified
the promissory note and accrued interest to settlement payable. No material gain or loss was recorded in connection with the settlement.
The unpaid balance as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 was $344,392. The Company is currently renegotiating the payment
terms and is currently in default. 

5. NOTES PAYABLE  

On September 30, 2010, the Company issued
an aggregate of $120,000 in unsecured promissory notes due five years from issuance at 8% per annum payable at maturity in exchange
for the cancellation of 15,000 previously issued warrants.  The fair value of the exchanged warrants, approximately equaled
the fair value of the issued notes at the date of the exchange. In September 2015, the Company extended one note for $33,333 till
December 31, 2015 and four, in aggregate of $86,667 till December 31, 2016. 

On October 29, 2015, the Company entered
into revenue based factoring agreement and received $44,010 in exchange for $54,573 of future receipts relating to monies collected
from customers or other third party payors. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is required to make daily payments equal
to 19% of the Company s daily cash or monetary sales receipts over the term of the agreement (approximately 11 months). The
Company has recorded a debt discount which is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the agreement.

prior to conversion. 

Azoth Funding LLC  

On May 31, 2016, the Company entered into
a Securities Purchase Agreement with Azoth Fund LLC, for the sale of a 8% convertible note in the principal amount of $73,500 (the
 Note ). The total net proceeds the Company received from this Offering was $32,500, net of fees of $3,500 and payoff
of a previously outstanding convertible note. 

The Note bears interest at the rate of
8% per annum. All interest and principal must be repaid on May 31, 2017 and is convertible into common stock, at Azoth Funding
LLC  s option, at a 50% discount to the lowest trading price of the common stock during the 20 trading day period prior to
conversion. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance was $-0-. 

Convertible Promissory Notes dated April
5, 2016  

On April 5, 2016, the Company issued a
$15,000 convertible promissory notes bearing interest at 12% per annum due upon maturity along with principal on August 31, 2016. 

The convertible promissory note is convertible,
at the holders  option, at $0.10 per share at any time, the due date or the time of a $5 million equity event, as defined. 

In connection with the issuance of the
convertible promissory notes, the Company issued detachable warrants granting the holder the right to acquire 30,000 shares of
the Company s common stock at $0.50 per share and expire 2 years from the date of issuance. 

Due to the nature of the previously issued
notes described above, the Company determined that the conversion feature requires classification as an embedded derivative. The
accounting treatment requires that the Company record at fair value at inception as a liability. The determined fair value (see
below) exceeded the net proceeds received, therefore no value were assigned to the issued detachable warrants as described in ASC
470-20. 

Summary:  

The Company has identified the embedded
derivatives related to the above described Notes. These embedded derivatives included certain conversion features and reset provisions.
The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record fair value of the derivatives as
of the inception date of the Notes and to fair value as of each subsequent reporting date. 

In connection with the Azoth financing,
the Company paid off a previously issued convertible debt. At the date(s) of payoff or exchange, the Company determined fair value
of the embedded derivatives of $72,174, using the Binominal Option Pricing Model with the following assumptions: contractual terms
of 0.45 years, an average risk free interest rate of 0.49%, a dividend yield of 0%, and volatility of 426.69%, was reclassified
to additional paid in capital. At final payoff of the Azoth financing, the Company determined fair value of the embedded derivatives
of $165,124, using the Binominal Option Pricing Model with the following assumptions: contractual terms of 0.68 years, an average
risk free interest rate of 0.40%, a dividend yield of 0%, and volatility of 386.02%, was reclassified to additional paid in capital

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

At the inception of the 2016 Notes, the
Company determined the aggregate fair value of $286,330 of embedded derivatives. The fair value of the embedded derivatives was
determined using the Binomial Option Pricing Model based on the following assumptions: (1) dividend yield of 0%; (2) expected volatility
of 412.78% to 451.23%, (3) weighted average risk-free interest rate of 0.36 % to 0.68%, (4) expected life of 0.41 to 1.00 year,
and (5) estimated fair value of the Company s common stock of $0.02 to $0.10 per share. 

The determined fair value of the debt derivatives
of $286,330 was charged as a debt discount up to the net proceeds of the notes with the remainder of $159,121 charged to current
period operations as non-cash interest expense 

At September 30, 2016, the Company marked
to market the fair value of the debt derivatives and determined a fair value of $110,971. The Company recorded a gain from change
in fair value of debt derivatives of $108,440 and $64,722 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016. The fair value
of the embedded derivatives was determined using Binomial Option Pricing Model based on the following assumptions: (1) dividend
yield of 0%, (2) expected volatility of 361.23%, (3) weighted average risk-free interest rate of 0.29% to 0.59%, (4) expected life
of 0.25 to 1.00 years, and (5) estimated fair value of the Company s common stock of $0.0057 per share. 

The charge of the amortization and write-off
of debt discounts and costs for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 was $152,468 and $270,376 which was accounted
for as interest expense. 

8. DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES  

As described in Note 7 and 13, the Company
issued convertible notes that contain conversion features and reset provision. The accounting treatment of derivative financial
instruments requires that the Company record fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date and to fair value as of each
subsequent reporting date.

On May 2, 2013, the Company, its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Instilend Technologies Inc. ( Instilend ) and Fortified Management Group, LLC ( Fortified ) entered
into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  APA ), pursuant to which Instilend sold all of its assets, including its proprietary
Matador, Locate Stock and LendEQS platforms, to Fortified in consideration of $3,000,000 (the  Purchase Price ) consisting
of 250,000 shares of common stock of the Company which were returned to the Company for cancellation in March of 2013, $2,500 per

13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

ASC 825-10 defines fair value as the price
that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded
at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions
that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk
of nonperformance. ASC 825-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825-10 establishes three levels of inputs that may be
used to measure fair value: 

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;   

Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; or   

Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and are unobservable.   

To the extent that valuation is based on
models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases,
for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is disclosed and is determined
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

Upon adoption of ASC 825-10, there was
no cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings and no impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

The carrying value of the Company s
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term borrowings (including convertible notes payable),
and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term maturity.

Corporate History  

Investview, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as
the  Company ,  Investview  or  INVU ) was formed in the State of Nevada on August 19, 2005.
Effective September 16, 2006, the Company changed its name to TheRetirementSolution.com, Inc., on October 1, 2008 the Company changed
its name to Global Investor Services, Inc. and on March 27, 2012, the Company changed its name to Investview, Inc. In June 2011
a new Chief Executive Officer was appointed. The stock symbol is INVU. 

Overview  

Investview is a New Jersey-based financial
services organization. The Company operates primarily through its wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries, to provide financial
products and services to accredited investors, self-directed investors and select financial institutions. Investview, Inc. also
provides investor education products. 

Through our wholly owned subsidiaries we (1)

Results of Operations  

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to three months ended September 30, 2015:  

Revenues:  

We realized a decrease in our recognized revenues
of 62% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from the prior year period due in part to a number of subscribers who elected
to pay for annual subscriptions which decreased the revenue that could be recognized in the quarter and in turn was reduced deferred
revenue. We proactively introduced both new products and a new marketing strategy to improve the lifetime value of our accounts.
We are now emphasizing our online based business model which provides subscription based services including trading ideas, tools
and education through live and recorded webinars and is marketed through a number of online media channels. Our trading and education
tools are located at  www.investview.com  whereas our 7 minute products have their own websites: www.7minute trader.com,
7minuteoptions.com, 7minutestocks.com and 7minuteinvestor.com . 

As we measured the attrition rates of the trading
and education offerings we determined that their lifetime value was approximating our cost of acquisition. As clients move through
the education modules they tend to exhaust their interest and either attrite or shift to the lower priced trading modules. Introduction
of the 7 minute trader has resulted in a better adoption rate, an improved retention rate and significantly lower acquisition costs. 

Operating Costs and Expenses:  

A summary of significant operating costs and
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2015 follows: 

As a percentage of revenues, the operating
margin increased to 99% in the current quarter from 81% in the same quarter last year due to the reduced operating costs and expenses. 

During the three months ended September 30,
2016, our  cost of sales  and service decreased to $295 as compared to $20,300 during the three months ended
September 30, 2015, primarily from the decrease in data feed costs of approximately 90%. 

Our  selling, general and administrative
expenses  decreased from $692,993 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $359,513 in current 2017 period or $333,480
(48%). Last year, the Company incurred approximately $66,000 in stock based compensation expense as compared to $-0- for the current
period. In addition, we have significantly reduced our operating and other costs in the current period as compared to the same
period, last year. 

Other:  

A summary of significant other income (expenses)
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2015 follows: 

Interest expense  decreased from $299,118
to $249,069, a $50,049 or 17% decrease.  The decrease primarily due to the a non-cash interest charge relating to issued
convertible debt of $261,810 during the three months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to $36,990 for the current period, net
with an increase in debt discount amortization which increased from $15,029 during the three months ended September 30, 2015 as
compared to $152,468 in the current period. 

Gain (loss) on change in fair value of derivative
liabilities  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had outstanding convertible promissory notes with
an embedded derivative, all requiring us to fair value the derivatives each reporting period and mark to market as a non-cash adjustment
to our current period operations. This resulted in a gain of $108,440 on change in fair value of derivative liabilities for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a loss of $265,332 for the same period last year. 

Six months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to six months ended September 30, 2015:  

Revenues:  

We realized a decrease in our recognized revenues
of 62% for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from the prior year period due in part to a number of subscribers who elected
to pay for annual subscriptions which decreased the revenue that could be recognized in the quarter and in turn was reduced deferred
revenue. We proactively introduced both new products and a new marketing strategy to improve the lifetime value of our accounts.

Operating Costs and Expenses:  

A summary of significant operating costs and
expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and the six months ended September 30, 2015 follows: 

As a percentage of revenues, the operating
margin increased to 98% in the current quarter from 83% in the same quarter last year due to the reduced operating costs and expenses. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2016,
our  cost of sales  and service decreased to $1,500 as compared to $38,727 during the six months ended September
30, 2015, primarily from the decrease in data feed costs of approximately 90%. 

Our  selling, general and administrative
expenses  decreased from $1,410,817 for the six months ended September 30, 2015 to $623,701 in current 2017 period or $787,116
(56%). Last year, the Company incurred approximately $58,235 in stock based compensation expense as compared to $28,650 for the
current period. In addition, we have significantly reduced our operating and other costs in the current period as compared to the
same period, last year. 

Other:  

A summary of significant other income (expenses)
for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and the six months ended September 30, 2015 follows: 

Interest expense  increased from $335,116
to $536,755, a $201,639 or 60% increase.  The increase primarily due to an increase in debt discount amortization which
increased from $15,029 during the six months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to $270,376 in the current period, net with a
decrease in non-cash interest charge relating to issued convertible debt from $261,810 during the six months ended September30,
2015 to $159,121 for the 2017 period. 

Gain (loss) on change in fair value of derivative
liabilities  During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had outstanding convertible promissory notes with an
embedded derivative, all requiring us to fair value the derivatives each reporting period and mark to market as a non-cash adjustment
to our current period operations. This resulted in a gain of $64,722 on change in fair value of derivative liabilities for the
six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a loss of $265,332 for the same period last year. 

Cash Used in Operating Activities:  

During the six months ended September 30, 2016,
our rate of usage of cash on a monthly basis from operations to a positive approximate $3,000 as compared to approximately $145,000
usage in the same period last year. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

During the six months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company incurred a loss from operations of $1,009,671. However, only minimal was cash related. The cash flow was funded by
existing cash and borrowing on convertible notes. As a result, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1,101 to $6,596 from
the beginning of the fiscal year of $7,697. 

The Company's current liabilities exceeded
its current assets (working capital deficit) by $4,683,474 as of September 30, 2016 as compared to $2,823,549 at March 31, 2016.
The increase in the working capital deficit is primarily due to the maturing of our convertible debt. 

Auditor s Opinion Expresses Doubt
About the Company s Ability to Continue as a  Going Concern   

The independent auditor s report on our
March 31, 2016 consolidated financial statements states that the Company's historical losses and accumulated deficiency raise
substantial doubts about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, due to the losses incurred and deficiency. If we
are unable to develop our business, we will have to reduce, discontinue operations or cease to exist, which would be detrimental
to the value of the Company's common stock. We can make no assurances that our business operations will develop and provide us
with significant cash to continue operations. 

In order to improve the Company's liquidity,
the Company's management is actively pursuing additional financing through discussions with investment bankers, financial institutions
and private investors. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its effort to secure additional financing. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of our financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base
our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Future events, however, may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions. While there are a number of significant
accounting policies affecting our consolidated financial statements; we believe the following critical accounting policy involves
the most complex, difficult and subjective estimates and judgments. 

Revenue Recognition  

For revenue from product sales and services,
the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10, Revenue Recognition ( ASC
605-10 ) which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable;
and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding
the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. 

Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers,
estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The
Company defers any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company
and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required. 

Revenue arises from subscriptions to the websites/software,
workshops, online workshops and training and coaching/counseling services where the customers are charged a monthly subscription
fee for access to the online training and courses and website/data.  All revenues are recognized in the month the products
and services are delivered. 

We sell our products separately and in various
bundles that contain multiple deliverables that include website/data subscriptions, educational workshops, online workshops and
training, one-on-one coaching and counseling sessions, along with other products and services.  The deferral policy for each
of the different types of revenues is summarized as follows: 

Product   
       
       Recognition Policy    

Live Workshops and Workshop Certificates  
       
      Deferred and recognized as the workshop is provided or certificate expires   

Online training and courses  
       
      Deferred and recognized a.) as the services are delivered, or b.) when usage thresholds are met, or c.) on a straight-line basis over the initial product period   

Coaching/Counseling services  
       
      Deferred and recognized as services are delivered, or on a straight-line basis over the term of the service contract   

Website/data fees (monthly)  
       
      Not deferred, recognized in the month delivered   

Website/data fees (pre-paid subscriptions)  
       
      Deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the subscription period   

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company has adopted Accounting Standards
Codification subtopic 718-10, Compensation-Stock Compensation ( ASC 718-10 ) which requires the measurement and recognition
of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees, directors and key consultants including employee
stock options and employee stock purchases related to an Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on the estimated fair values. 

For the periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, the Company did not grant stock options to employees. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

Fair value estimates discussed herein are based
upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016.
The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial
instruments include cash, notes payable, convertible notes payable, derivative liabilities and accounts payable. Fair values were
assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate
fair values or they are payable on demand. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

There were various updates recently issued,
most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not
expected to a have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company does not have any off balance sheet
arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, and results of
operations, liquidity or capital expenditures. 

ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK  

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this item. 

ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures  

Our management, with
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible
controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Our disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system
are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer
have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective. 

Control Deficiencies
and Remediation Plan  

Management
has identified control deficiencies regarding the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger internal control environment.
Management of the Company believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the Company s accounting staff
and reliance on outside consultants for external reporting.  The small size of the Company s accounting staff may
prevent adequate controls in the future, such as segregation of duties, due to the cost/benefit of such remediation.  

To
mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along
with the use of outside legal and accounting professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will
enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework.  

These
control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of account balances that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement to our consolidated financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, we have
determined that these control deficiencies as described above together constitute a material weakness.  

Changes in Internal
Controls  

Other than mentioned
above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

On August 21, 2013, Evenflow Funding, LLC ( Evenflow ),
a creditor of the Company due to the Company s issuance of a promissory note dated January 20, 2009 for $200,000, filed a
complaint against the Company, and certain officers that personally guaranteed the original note, in the Supreme Court of the State
of New Jersey (the  Court ) for payment of the promissory note, accrued interest and penalties in aggregate of $931,521. 

On October 13, 2014, Evenflow filed a Stipulation
of Settlement (the  Settlement ) with the Court, in connection with the NJ Action. Pursuant to the Settlement, the Company
agreed to pay to Evenflow $425,000 (the  Settlement Amount ) in quarterly payments (the  Quarterly Payments )
equal to 10% of the net revenue (revenue less allowances, returns and payments to revenue sharing agreements) of the Company as
reported in the Company's periodic reports filed on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K (collectively, the  Periodic Reports ) commencing
with the Company's September 30, 2014 Periodic Report. The Quarterly Payments are due and payable by the Company on the tenth day
following the filing of each Periodic Report. In addition to the Quarterly Payments, the Company agreed to make an initial payment
in the amount of $25,000 upon the filing of the Settlement with the Court, as well as a payment in the amount of $25,000 due on
the 12 month anniversary of the Initial Payment. We are currently renegotiating the payment terms of this  Settlement . 

The Company may be subject to other legal proceedings
and claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur,
the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on its financial position,
results of operations or liquidity. The Company had no other pending legal proceedings or claims other than described above as
of September 30, 2016. 

None of our directors, officers, or affiliates
is involved in a proceeding adverse to our business or has a material interest adverse to our business.
