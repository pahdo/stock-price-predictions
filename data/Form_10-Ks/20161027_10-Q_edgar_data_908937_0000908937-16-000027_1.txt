    Business   Basis of Presentation 
     Business 
  We transmit music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, as well as infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis through our   two   proprietary satellite radio systems.  Subscribers can also receive music and other channels, plus features such as SiriusXM On Demand and MySXM, over our Internet radio service, including through applications for mobile devices.  We are also a leader in providing connected vehicle services.  Our connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers. 
  We have agreements with every major automaker ( OEMs ) to offer satellite radio in their vehicles. We also acquire subscribers through marketing to owners and lessees of previously owned vehicles that include factory-installed satellite radios that are not currently subscribing to our services.  Additionally, we distribute our satellite radios through retailers online and at locations nationwide and through our website.  Satellite radio services are also offered to customers of certain rental car companies. 
  Our primary source of revenue is subscription fees, with most of our customers subscribing on an annual, semi-annual, quarterly or monthly plan.  We offer discounts for prepaid, longer term subscription plans, as well as a multiple subscription discount.  We also derive revenue from activation and other fees, the sale of advertising on select non-music channels, the direct sale of satellite radios and accessories, and other ancillary services, such as our weather, traffic and data services. 
  In certain cases, a subscription to our radio services is included in the sale or lease price of new or previously owned vehicles. The length of these subscriptions varies but is typically   three   to   twelve months  .  We receive payments for these subscriptions from certain automakers.  We also reimburse various automakers for certain costs associated with satellite radios installed in new vehicles. 
  As of September 30, 2016, Liberty Media Corporation ( Liberty Media ) beneficially owned, directly and indirectly, approximately   65%   of the outstanding shares of our common stock.  As a result, we are a  controlled company  for the purposes of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.  Liberty Media owns interests in a range of media, communications and entertainment businesses. 
  Recent Development 
  Recapitalization of Sirius XM Canada 
  On May 12, 2016, our subsidiary, Sirius XM Radio Inc. ( Sirius XM ), entered into an arrangement agreement (the  Arrangement Agreement ) with Sirius XM Canada Holdings Inc. ("Sirius XM Canada"), an entity in which Sirius XM currently holds an approximate   37%   economic interest and   25%   voting interest.  Pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement, Sirius XM and certain Canadian shareholders will form a new company to acquire shares of Sirius XM Canada not already owned by them pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the  Transaction ). In connection with the Transaction, Sirius XM Canada s shareholders will be entitled to elect to receive, for each share of Sirius XM Canada held, C  $4.50   (U.S.   $3.50   as of May 12, 2016) in (i) cash, (ii) shares of our common stock, (iii) a security exchangeable for shares of our common stock, or (iv) a combination thereof; provided that no more than   50%   of the total consideration in the Transaction (or up to   35,000   shares) will be issued in our common stock and exchangeable shares.  All of the obligations of Sirius XM under the Arrangement Agreement are guaranteed by us. 
  Following the Transaction, Sirius XM is expected to hold a   70%   economic interest and   33%   voting interest in Sirius XM Canada, with the remainder of the voting power and economic interest held by Slaight Communications and Obelysk Media,   two   of Sirius XM Canada s current Canadian shareholders. Sirius XM expects to contribute to Sirius XM Canada approximately U.S.   $275,000   in connection with the Transaction (assuming that all shareholders elect to receive cash in connection with the Transaction), which amount is expected to be used to pay the cash consideration to Sirius XM Canada s shareholders and will be decreased proportionately if shareholders elect to receive consideration in shares of our common stock or securities exchangeable for our common stock.

The Transaction has been approved by the stockholders of Sirius XM Canada and has received the required court approval.  The Transaction remains subject to receipt of Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission approval.  Pending receipt of this approval, the Transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q presents information for Sirius XM Holdings Inc. ( Holdings ).  Holdings has no operations independent of its wholly-owned subsidiary Sirius XM. 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Holdings and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial reporting.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. 
  Certain numbers in our prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to our current period presentation.  All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  In the opinion of our management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   have been made. 
  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year.  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read together with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the SEC on February 2, 2016. 
  Public companies are required to disclose certain information about their reportable operating segments.  Operating segments are defined as significant components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision makers in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance of the segment. We have determined that we have   one   reportable segment as our chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, assesses performance and allocates resources based on the consolidated results of operations of our business. 
  We have evaluated events subsequent to the balance sheet date and prior to the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and have determined that no events have occurred that would require adjustment to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.  For a discussion of subsequent events that do not require adjustment to our unaudited consolidated financial statements refer to Note 15. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes.  Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include asset impairment, depreciable lives of our satellites, share-based payment expense, and income taxes. 

(2) 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     Fair Value Measurements 
  For assets and liabilities required to be reported at fair value, GAAP provides a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.  Level 1 inputs are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.  Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted market prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable approximated fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value were as follows: 

(b) 
    The fair value for non-publicly traded instruments is based upon estimates from a market maker and brokerage firm.  Refer to Note 10 for information related to the carrying value of our debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
     Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  The areas for simplification in this ASU involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, forfeiture calculations, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted.  An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. 
  We elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 in the third quarter of 2016, which required that any adjustments be reflected as of January 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption.  The primary impact of adoption of ASU 2016-09 was the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of   $1,101   and   $1,950   for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  The adoption of this ASU impacted our previously reported quarterly results during fiscal year 2016 as follows: 

Additionally, we recognized net operating losses related to excess share-based compensation tax return deductions that were previously tracked off balance sheet but not recorded in our financial statements.  As of January 1, 2016, the cumulative effect in the amount of   $293,896  , net of a   $1,946   reserve for an uncertain tax position, was recorded as an increase to our Deferred tax assets and decrease to our Accumulated deficit in our unaudited consolidated balance sheets as a result of this cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. 
  Additional amendments to this ASU related to income taxes and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to accumulated deficit, where the cumulative effect of these changes are required to be recorded.  Further, there was no impact to our classification of awards as either equity or liabilities.  We also elected to true-up forfeitures in the period of adoption and in the future will recognize forfeitures as they occur. 
  This ASU also required excess tax benefits to be separated from other income tax cash flows and classified as an operating activity, however there was no impact to the consolidated statement of cash flows as we have not had any excess tax

benefits (windfalls) recorded for book purposes.  The presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows as such cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  .  This ASU requires a company to recognize lease assets and liabilities arising from operating leases in the statement of financial position.  This ASU does not significantly change the previous lease guidance for how a lessee should recognize the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease.  Additionally, the criteria for classifying a finance lease versus an operating lease are substantially the same as the previous guidance.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted.  This ASU must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.  We plan to adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .  This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which amended the effective date of this ASU to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted only for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  We plan to adopt this ASU on January 1, 2018.  In 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance which clarified principal versus agent considerations, identification of performance obligations and the implementation guidance for licensing.  In addition, the FASB issued guidance regarding practical expedients related to disclosures of remaining performance obligations, as well as other amendments to guidance on transition, collectibility, non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes.  Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.

    Earnings per Share 
     Basic net income per common share is calculated by dividing the income available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during each reporting period.  Diluted net income per common share adjusts the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the potential dilution that could occur if common stock equivalents (stock options and restricted stock units) were exercised or converted into common stock, calculated using the treasury stock method.  We had   no   participating securities during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Common stock equivalents of   192,134   and   162,433   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   239,205   and   127,231   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per common share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. 

(4) 
    Receivables, net 
     Receivables, net, includes customer accounts receivable, receivables from distributors and other receivables. 
  Customer accounts receivable, net, includes receivables from our subscribers and advertising customers and is stated at amounts due, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of various factors.  We consider historical experience, the age of the receivable balances, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect the counterparty s ability to pay.  Bad debt expense is included in Customer service and billing expense in our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
  Receivables from distributors primarily include billed and unbilled amounts due from OEMs for services included in the sale or lease price of vehicles, as well as billed amounts due from wholesale distributors of our satellite radios.  Other receivables primarily include amounts due from manufacturers of our radios, modules and chipsets where we are entitled to subsidies and royalties based on the number of units produced.  We have not established an allowance for doubtful accounts for our receivables from distributors or other receivables as we have historically not experienced any significant collection issues with OEMs or other third parties. 
  Receivables, net, consists of the following: 

(5) 
    Inventory, net 
     Inventory consists of finished goods, refurbished goods, chipsets and other raw material components used in manufacturing radios. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market.  We record an estimated allowance for inventory that is considered slow moving or obsolete or whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value.  The provision related to

products purchased for resale in our direct to consumer distribution channel and components held for resale by us is reported as a component of Cost of equipment in our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  The provision related to inventory consumed in our OEM and retail distribution channel is reported as a component of Subscriber acquisition costs in our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
  Inventory, net, consists of the following: 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations.  Our annual impairment assessment of our single reporting unit is performed as of the fourth quarter of each year, and an assessment is performed at other times if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.  If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no indicators of impairment, and   no   impairment loss was recorded for goodwill during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the cumulative balance of goodwill impairments recorded since the July 2008 merger (the  Merger ) between our wholly owned subsidiary, Vernon Merger Corporation, and XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. ( XM ), was   $4,766,190  , which was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Indefinite Life Intangible Assets 
  We have identified our FCC licenses and the XM trademark as indefinite life intangible assets after considering the expected use of the assets, the regulatory and economic environment within which they are used and the effects of obsolescence on their use. 
  We hold FCC licenses to operate our satellite digital audio radio service and provide ancillary services. The following table outlines the years in which each of our satellite licenses expires: 

* As of April 7, 2016, this satellite was no longer being used to transmit satellite radio.  We plan to complete the deorbiting of this satellite during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  Prior to expiration of our FCC licenses, we are required to apply for a renewal of our FCC licenses.  The renewal and extension of our licenses is reasonably certain at minimal cost, which is expensed as incurred.  Each of the FCC licenses authorizes us to use the radio spectrum, which is a renewable, reusable resource that does not deplete or exhaust over time. 
  Our annual impairment assessment of our identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets is performed as of the fourth quarter of each year.  An assessment is performed at other times if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value.  If the carrying value of the intangible assets exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.

Our debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following:   

           (a) 
    The carrying value of the obligations is net of any remaining unamortized original issue discount. 
              (b) 
    Substantially all of our domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries have guaranteed these notes. 
               (d) 
    The liens securing the   5.25%   Notes are equal and ratable to the liens granted to secure the Credit Facility.   
              (e) 
    Sirius XM's obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of its material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a lien on substantially all of Sirius XM's assets and the assets of its material domestic subsidiaries.  Interest on borrowings is payable on a monthly basis and accrues at a rate based on LIBOR plus an applicable rate.  Sirius XM is also required to pay a variable fee on the average daily unused portion of the Credit Facility which is payable on a quarterly basis.  The variable rate for the unused portion of the Credit Facility was   0.25%   per annum as of   September 30, 2016  .  Sirius XM's outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as Long-term debt within our unaudited consolidated balance sheets due to the long-term maturity of this debt.  For a discussion of subsequent events refer to Note 15. 
      Covenants and Restrictions 
  Under the Credit Facility, Sirius XM, our wholly-owned subsidiary, must comply with a debt maintenance covenant that it not exceed a total leverage ratio, calculated as consolidated total debt to consolidated operating cash flow, of   5.0   to 1.0.

  The indentures governing Sirius XM's notes restrict Sirius XM's non-guarantor subsidiaries' ability to create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness without such non-guarantor subsidiary guaranteeing each such series of notes on a pari passu basis.  The indentures governing the notes also contain covenants that, among other things, limit Sirius XM's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to create certain liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and merge or consolidate. 
  Under Sirius XM's debt agreements, the following generally constitute an event of default: (i) a default in the payment of interest; (ii) a default in the payment of principal; (iii) failure to comply with covenants; (iv) failure to pay other indebtedness after final maturity or acceleration of other indebtedness exceeding a specified amount; (v) certain events of bankruptcy; (vi) a judgment for payment of money exceeding a specified aggregate amount; and (vii) voidance of subsidiary guarantees, subject to grace periods where applicable.  If an event of default occurs and is continuing, our debt could become immediately due and payable. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we were in compliance with our debt covenants.

We recognized share-based payment expense of   $30,020   and   $23,393   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $77,890   and   $62,334   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  2015 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan 
  In May 2015, our stockholders approved the Sirius XM Holdings Inc. 2015 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ).  Employees, consultants and members of our board of directors are eligible to receive awards under the 2015 Plan.  The 2015 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards that the compensation committee of our board of directors deem appropriate.  Stock-based awards granted under the 2015 Plan are generally subject to a graded vesting requirement, which is generally   three   to   four years   from the grant date, and may include performance requirements.  Stock options generally expire   ten years   from the date of grant.  Each restricted stock unit entitles the holder to receive   one   share of common stock upon vesting.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   181,711   shares of common stock were available for future grants under the 2015 Plan. 
  Other Plans 
  We maintain   four   other share-based benefit plans   the Sirius XM Radio Inc. 2009 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, the XM 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, the Amended and Restated Sirius Satellite Radio 2003 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan and the XM 1998 Shares Award Plan. No further awards may be made under these plans.   
  The following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions used to compute the fair value of options granted to employees and members of our board of directors: 

There were no options granted to third parties during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Since we have not historically paid dividends on our common stock, the dividend yield used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option value was zero for all periods. 
  The following table summarizes stock option activity under our share-based plans for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

The weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.83  .  The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $59,531   and   $85,387  , respectively.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the number of net settled shares which were issued as a result of stock option exercises was   8,171  .

We recognized share-based payment expense associated with stock options of   $21,484   and   $19,418   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $59,510   and   $52,662   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The following table summarizes the restricted stock unit, including performance-based restricted stock units ("PRSUs"), and stock award activity under our share-based plans for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

The total intrinsic value of restricted stock units and stock awards vesting during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $16,890   and   $9,565  , respectively.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the number of net settled shares which were issued as a result of restricted stock units vesting and the number of shares issued from stock awards granted totaled   2,387  . 
  On August 5, 2016, we granted   3,036   PRSUs to certain employees, the vesting of which is subject to the employee's continuing employment and our achievement of certain performance goals.  The awards cliff vest on the   three  -year anniversary of the grant date.  We believe it is probable that the performance target applicable to these PRSUs will be achieved. 
  We recognized share-based payment expense associated with restricted stock units and stock awards of   $8,536   and   $3,975   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $18,380   and   $9,672   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   included   $669   of compensation expense related to PRSUs. 
  Total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested share-based payment awards for stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees, members of our board of directors and third parties at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $281,678   and   $261,628  , respectively.  The total unrecognized compensation costs at   September 30, 2016   are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.7   years. 
  401(k) Savings Plan 
  Sirius XM sponsors the Sirius XM Radio Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan (the  Sirius XM Plan ) for eligible employees. The Sirius XM Plan allows eligible employees to voluntarily contribute from   1%   to   50%   of their pre-tax eligible earnings, subject to certain defined limits. We match   50%   of an employee s voluntary contributions per pay period on the first   6%   of an employee s pre-tax salary up to a maximum of   3%   of eligible compensation.  We may also make additional discretionary matching, true-up matching and non-elective contributions to the Sirius XM Plan.  Employer matching contributions under the Sirius XM Plan vest at a rate of   33.33%   for each year of employment and are fully vested after   three years   of employment for all current and future contributions.  Our cash employer matching contributions are not used to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market, unless the employee elects our common stock as their investment option for this contribution.  We recognized   $1,640   and   $1,486   in expense during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $4,857   and   $6,026   in expense during   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan 
  In 2015, we adopted the Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the  DCP ).  The DCP allows members of our board of directors and certain eligible employees to defer all or a portion of their base salary, cash incentive compensation and/or board of directors  compensation, as applicable, each plan year starting in 2016.  Pursuant to the terms of the DCP, we may elect to make additional contributions beyond amounts deferred by participants, but we are under no obligation to do so.  We have established a grantor (or  rabbi ) trust to facilitate the payment of our obligations under the DCP.

    Commitments and Contingencies    
     The following table summarizes our expected contractual cash commitments as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    The table does not include our reserve for uncertain tax positions, which at   September 30, 2016   totaled   $5,427  , as the specific timing of any cash payments cannot be projected with reasonable certainty. 
     Debt obligations.      Debt obligations include principal payments on outstanding debt and capital lease obligations. 
  Cash interest payments.      Cash interest payments include interest due on outstanding debt and capital lease payments through maturity. 
  Satellite and transmission.      We have entered into agreements with third parties to operate and maintain the off-site satellite telemetry, tracking and control facilities and certain components of our terrestrial repeater networks.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we entered into an agreement with Space Systems/Loral to design and build   two   replacement satellites, SXM-7 and SXM-8, for our service. 
  Programming and content.      We have entered into various programming agreements. Under the terms of these agreements, our obligations include fixed payments, advertising commitments and revenue sharing arrangements. Our future revenue sharing costs are dependent upon many factors and are difficult to estimate; therefore, they are not included in our minimum contractual cash commitments. 
  Marketing and distribution.      We have entered into various marketing, sponsorship and distribution agreements to promote our brand and are obligated to make payments to sponsors, retailers, automakers and radio manufacturers under these agreements. Certain programming and content agreements also require us to purchase advertising on properties owned or controlled by the licensors. We also reimburse automakers for certain engineering and development costs associated with the incorporation of satellite radios into new vehicles they manufacture. 
  Satellite incentive payments.      Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc., the manufacturer of certain of our in-orbit satellites, may be entitled to future in-orbit performance payments with respect to XM-3 and XM-4 meeting their   fifteen  -year design life, which we expect to occur.  Boeing may also be entitled to additional incentive payments up to   $10,000   if our XM-4 satellite continues to operate above baseline specifications during the   five years   beyond the satellite s   fifteen  -year design life. 
  Space Systems/Loral, the manufacturer of certain of our in-orbit satellites, may be entitled to future in-orbit performance payments with respect to XM-5, FM-5 and FM-6 meeting their   fifteen  -year design life, which we expect to occur.

Operating lease obligations.      We have entered into both cancelable and non-cancelable operating leases for office space, equipment and terrestrial repeaters. These leases provide for minimum lease payments, additional operating expense charges, leasehold improvements and rent escalations that have initial terms ranging from   one   to   fifteen years  , and certain leases have options to renew. The effect of the rent holidays and rent concessions are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods. 
  Other.      We have entered into various agreements with third parties for general operating purposes. In addition to the minimum contractual cash commitments described above, we have entered into agreements with other variable cost arrangements. These future costs are dependent upon many factors and are difficult to anticipate; however, these costs may be substantial. We may enter into additional programming, distribution, marketing and other agreements that contain similar variable cost provisions.  The cost of our stock acquired but not paid for as of     September 30, 2016     is     also     included in this category. 
  We do not have any other significant off-balance sheet financing arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
  Legal Proceedings 
  In the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant or party to various claims and lawsuits, including those discussed below. 
  We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and make adjustments as appropriate.  Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of a loss or potential loss.  We may be unable to reasonably estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for a particular legal contingency for various reasons, including, among others, because: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the relative early stages; (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending proceedings (including motions and appeals); (iv) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of settlement and the outcome of any negotiations with respect thereto; (v) there remain significant factual issues to be determined or resolved; (vi) the relevant law is unsettled; or (vii) the proceedings involve novel or untested legal theories.  In such instances, there may be considerable uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss, if any. 
  Telephone Consumer Protection Act Suits  .  We are a defendant in several purported class action suits that allege that we, or call center vendors acting on our behalf, made calls which violate provisions of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the  TCPA ).  The plaintiffs in these actions allege, among other things, that we called mobile phones using an automatic telephone dialing system without the consumer s prior consent or, alternatively, after the consumer revoked his or her prior consent.  In one of the actions, the plaintiff also alleges that we violated the TCPA s call time restrictions and, in one of the other actions, the plaintiff also alleges that we violated the TCPA s do not call restrictions.  These purported class action cases are titled   Erik Knutson v. Sirius XM Radio Inc.  , No. 12-cv-0418-AJB-NLS (S.D. Cal.),   Francis W. Hooker v. Sirius XM Radio Inc.  , No. 4:13-cv-3 (E.D. Va.),   Yefim Elikman v. Sirius XM Radio Inc. and Career Horizons, Inc.  , No. 1:15-cv-02093 (N.D. Ill.), and   Anthony Parker v. Sirius XM Radio Inc.  , No. 8:15-cv-01710-JSM-EAJ (M.D. Fla), and are described in Item 3., Legal Proceedings, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  We have entered into an agreement to settle these purported class action suits.  The settlement is expected to resolve the claims of consumers beginning in February 2008 relating to telemarketing calls to their mobile telephones.  As part of this settlement, we have made a   $35,000   payment to a settlement fund (from which notice, administration and other costs and attorneys  fees will be paid), and are offering participating class members the option of receiving   three months   of our Select service for no charge, and will enter into agreements to make modifications to the practices of certain call center vendors.  The settlement is subject to final court approval, which cannot be assured.

In August 2013, SoundExchange, Inc. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we underpaid royalties for statutory licenses during the 2007-2012 period in violation of the regulations established by the Copyright Royalty Board for that period.  SoundExchange principally alleges that we improperly reduced our calculation of gross revenues, on which the royalty payments are based, by deducting non-recognized revenue attributable to pre-1972 recordings and Premier package revenue that is not  separately charged  as

required by the regulations.  SoundExchange is seeking compensatory damages of not less than   $50,000   and up to   $100,000   or more, payment of late fees and interest, and attorneys  fees and costs. 
  In August 2014, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted our motion to dismiss the complaint without prejudice on the grounds that the case properly should be pursued before the Copyright Royalty Board rather than the district court.  In December 2014, SoundExchange filed a petition with the Copyright Royalty Board requesting an order interpreting the applicable regulations.  We have submitted legal briefs and other evidence supporting our position that our payments and practices complied with the regulations established by the Copyright Royalty Board for statutory licenses during the 2007-2012 period or, in the event that the Judges should find that the applicable regulations were unclear, that the Judges should clarify the regulations and confirm that our payments and practices complied with the regulations for that period.  Briefing in this matter is complete and a decision from the Copyright Royalty Board is pending. 
  This matter is titled   SoundExchange, Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio, Inc.  , No.13-cv-1290-RJL (D.D.C.), and   Determination of Rates and Terms for Preexisting Subscription Services and Satellite Digital Audio Radio Services,   United States Copyright Royalty Board, No. 2006-1 CRB DSTRA.  Information concerning the action is publicly available in filings under the docket numbers.  The outcome of this matter is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  No provision was made for losses to the extent such are not probable and estimable.  We believe we have substantial defenses to the claims asserted, and intend to defend this action vigorously. 
  Other Matters  .  In the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant in various other lawsuits and arbitration proceedings, including derivative actions; actions filed by subscribers, both on behalf of themselves and on a class action basis; former employees; parties to contracts or leases; and owners of patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property.  None of these other matters, in our opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

We file a consolidated federal income tax return for all of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Sirius XM.  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , income tax expense was   $111,556   and   $112,543  , respectively.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , income tax expense was   $326,108   and   $296,893  , respectively. 
  Our effective tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   36.5%   and   37.6%  , respectively.  Our effective tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   40.3%   and   44.2%  , respectively.  Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   was impacted by tax law changes in the District of Columbia and New York City.  The tax law change in the District of Columbia will reduce our future tax and thus we will use less of certain net operating losses in the future which resulted in a   $44,392   increase in our valuation allowance during the three months ended March 31, 2015.  The tax law change in New York City will increase certain net operating losses to be utilized in the future which resulted in a   $14,831   increase in our deferred tax asset during the three months ended June 30, 2015. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets of   $49,257   and   $49,095  , respectively, that were not likely to be realized due to certain net operating loss limitations and acquired net operating losses that were not more likely than not going to be utilized. 

Debt Redemption 
  On October 1, 2016, we redeemed   $650,000   in principal amount of our outstanding   5.875%   Notes for an approximate purchase price of   $669,097  , including premium, which will result in the recognition of a Loss on extinguishment of debt and credit facilities, net, of approximately   $24,229   in the fourth quarter of 2016.  This redemption was funded with   $359,097   of Cash and cash equivalents and   $310,000   of additional borrowings under our Credit Facility.

Capital Return Program 
  For the period from October 1, 2016 to   October 25, 2016  , we repurchased   18,548   shares of our common stock on the open market for an aggregate purchase price of   $76,791  , including fees and commissions. 
  On October 26, 2016, our board of directors approved an additional   $2,000,000   for repurchase of our common stock.  The new approval increases the amount of common stock that we have been authorized to repurchase to an aggregate of   $10,000,000  .  Shares of common stock may be purchased from time to time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, including in accelerated stock repurchase transactions and transactions with Liberty Media and its affiliates.  We intend to fund the additional repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and future borrowings. 
  On October 26, 2016, our board of directors also declared the first quarterly dividend on our common stock in the amount of   $0.01   per share of common stock payable on November 30, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 9, 2016.  Our board of directors expects that this dividend will be the first of regular quarterly dividends, in an aggregate annual amount of   $0.04   per share of common stock.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
     All amounts referenced in this Item 2 are in thousands, except per subscriber and per installation amounts, unless otherwise stated. 
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
  The following cautionary statements identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other reports and documents published by us from time to time. Any statements about our beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations, assumptions, future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as  will likely result,   are expected to,   will continue,   is anticipated,   estimated,   intend,   plan,   projection  and  outlook.  Any forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other reports and documents published by us from time to time, particularly the risk factors described under  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations  herein and in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Among the significant factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are: 
             
    we face substantial competition and that competition is likely to increase over time; 
                
    our ability to attract and retain subscribers in the future is uncertain; 
                
    consumer protection laws and their enforcement could damage our business; 
                
    the unfavorable outcome of pending or future litigation; 
                
    the market for music rights is changing and is subject to significant uncertainties; 
                
    our business depends in large part upon the auto industry; 
                
    general economic conditions can affect our business; 
                
    if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer; 
                
    other existing or future government laws and regulations could harm our business; 
                
    failure of our satellites would significantly damage our business; 
                
    interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could negatively impact our results and our brand; 
                
    we may not realize the benefits of acquisitions or other strategic initiatives; 
                
    rapid technological and industry changes could adversely impact our services; 
                
    failure of third parties to perform could adversely affect our business; 
                
    our service may experience harmful interference from new and existing wireless operations; 
                
    failure to comply with FCC requirements could damage our business; 
                
    we may from time to time modify our business plan, and these changes could adversely affect us and our financial condition; 
                
    we have a significant amount of indebtedness, and our revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that restrict our current and future operations; 
     
   25 

     Table of Contents  

our studios, terrestrial repeater networks, satellite uplink facilities or other ground facilities could be damaged by natural catastrophes or terrorist activities; 
                
    our principal stockholder has significant influence, including over actions requiring stockholder approval, and its interests may differ from the interests of other holders of our common stock;  
                
    we are a  controlled company  within the meaning of the NASDAQ listing rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements; and 
                
    our business may be impaired by third-party intellectual property rights.  
       
  Because the risk factors referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. In addition, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made, to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or otherwise, except as required by law. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise or to assess with any precision the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  

Executive Summary 
  We transmit music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, as well as infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis through our two proprietary satellite radio systems.  Subscribers can also receive music and other channels, plus features such as SiriusXM On Demand and MySXM, over our Internet radio service, including through applications for mobile devices.  We are also a leader in providing connected vehicle services.  Our connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.   
  We have agreements with every major automaker ( OEMs ) to offer satellite radio in their vehicles.  We also acquire subscribers through marketing to owners and lessees of previously owned vehicles that include factory-installed satellite radios that are not currently subscribing to our services.  Additionally, we distribute our satellite radios through retailers online and at locations nationwide and through our website.  Satellite radio services are also offered to customers of certain rental car companies. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   31.0   million subscribers of which approximately   25.5   million were self-pay subscribers and approximately   5.5   million were paid promotional subscribers. Our subscriber totals include subscribers under our regular pricing plans; discounted pricing plans; subscribers that have prepaid, including payments either made or due from automakers for subscriptions included in the sale or lease price of a vehicle; subscribers to our Internet services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions; and certain subscribers to our weather, traffic, and data services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions.  Subscribers and subscription related revenues and expenses associated with our connected vehicle services and the Sirius XM Canada service are not included in our subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.  
  Our primary source of revenue is subscription fees, with most of our customers subscribing on an annual, semi-annual, quarterly or monthly plan.  We offer discounts for prepaid, longer term subscription plans, as well as a multiple subscription discount.  We also derive revenue from activation and other fees, the sale of advertising on select non-music channels, the direct sale of satellite radios and accessories, and other ancillary services, such as our weather, traffic and data services. 
  In certain cases, a subscription to our radio services is included in the sale or lease price of new vehicles or previously owned vehicles. The length of these subscriptions varies but is typically three to twelve months.  We receive payments for these subscriptions from certain automakers.  We also reimburse various automakers for certain costs associated with satellite radios installed in new vehicles. 
  As of September 30, 2016, Liberty Media beneficially owned, directly and indirectly, approximately   65%   of the outstanding shares of our common stock.  As a result, we are a  controlled company  for the purposes of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.  Liberty Media owns interests in a range of media, communications and entertainment businesses.

Recent Development 
  Recapitalization of Sirius XM Canada 
  On May 12, 2016, our subsidiary, Sirius XM Radio Inc. ( Sirius XM ), entered into an arrangement agreement (the  Arrangement Agreement ) with Sirius XM Canada Holdings Inc. ("Sirius XM Canada"), an entity in which Sirius XM currently holds an approximate   37%   economic interest and   25%   voting interest.  Pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement, Sirius XM and certain Canadian shareholders will form a new company to acquire shares of Sirius XM Canada not already owned by them pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the  Transaction ). In connection with the Transaction, Sirius XM Canada s shareholders will be entitled to elect to receive, for each share of Sirius XM Canada held, C  $4.50   (U.S.   $3.50   as of May 12, 2016) in (i) cash, (ii) shares of our common stock, (iii) a security exchangeable for shares of our common stock, or (iv) a combination thereof; provided that no more than   50%   of the total consideration in the Transaction (or up to   35,000   shares) will be issued in our common stock and exchangeable shares.  All of the obligations of Sirius XM under the Arrangement Agreement are guaranteed by us. 
  Following the Transaction, Sirius XM is expected to hold a   70%   economic interest and   33%   voting interest in Sirius XM Canada, with the remainder of the voting power and economic interest held by Slaight Communications and Obelysk Media,   two   of Sirius XM Canada s current Canadian shareholders. Sirius XM expects to contribute to Sirius XM Canada approximately U.S.   $275,000   in connection with the Transaction (assuming that all shareholders elect to receive cash in connection with the Transaction), which amount is expected to be used to pay the cash consideration to Sirius XM Canada s shareholders and will be decreased proportionately if shareholders elect to receive consideration in shares of our common stock or securities exchangeable for our common stock. 
  The Transaction has been approved by the stockholders of Sirius XM Canada and has received the required court approval.  The Transaction remains subject to receipt of Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission approval.  Pending receipt of this approval, the Transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Results of Operations 
  Set forth below are our results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 

Total Revenue 
  Subscriber Revenue   includes subscription, activation and other fees. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , subscriber revenue was   $1,069,746   and   $974,471  , respectively,   an increase   of   10%  , or   $95,275  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , subscriber revenue was   $3,112,712   and   $2,826,018  , respectively,   an increase   of   10%  , or   $286,694  .  The period over period increase was primarily attributable to a 7% and 8% increase in daily weighted average number of subscribers for the three and  
  
   28 

     Table of Contents  

nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as well as a 3% increase in average monthly revenue per subscriber resulting from our price changes and mix of plans. 
  We expect subscriber revenues to increase based on the growth of our subscriber base, the effects of increases in certain of our subscription rates and the sale of additional services to subscribers. 
  Advertising Revenue   includes the sale of advertising on certain non-music channels. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , advertising revenue was   $34,268   and   $33,131  , respectively,   an increase   of   3%  , or   $1,137  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , advertising revenue was   $99,330   and   $88,843  , respectively,   an increase   of   12%  , or   $10,487  .  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the increase was primarily due to a greater number of advertising spots sold and transmitted, partially offset by the loss of a significant advertiser due to state regulatory activities surrounding the fantasy sports industry.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the increase was primarily due to a greater number of advertising spots sold and transmitted as well as increased rates per spot. 
  We expect our advertising revenue to continue to grow as more advertisers are attracted to our national platform and growing subscriber base and as we launch additional non-music channels. 
  Equipment Revenue   includes revenue and royalties from the sale of satellite radios, components and accessories. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , equipment revenue was   $31,306   and   $25,875  , respectively,   an increase   of   21%  , or   $5,431  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , equipment revenue was   $86,285   and   $79,979  , respectively,   an increase   of   8%  , or   $6,306  .  The period over period increase for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was driven by an increase in OEM production and an increase in royalty revenue on certain modules starting early in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by lower sales through our aftermarket and direct to consumer businesses. 
  We expect equipment revenue to fluctuate based on OEM production for which we receive royalty payments for our technology and, to a lesser extent, on the volume of equipment sales in our aftermarket and direct to consumer businesses. 
  Other Revenue   includes amounts earned from subscribers for the U.S. Music Royalty Fee, and revenue from our connected vehicle services, our Canadian affiliate and ancillary revenues. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , other revenue was   $142,326   and   $136,235  , respectively, an increase of   4%  , or   $6,091  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , other revenue was   $415,895   and   $379,072  , respectively,   an increase   of   10%  , or   $36,823  .  The period over period increase was primarily driven by revenues from the U.S. Music Royalty Fee due to an increase in the number of subscribers and subscribers paying at a higher rate.  These increases were offset by lower activation revenues and a change in a programming contract in the third quarter of 2015 related to our Canadian affiliate and the timing of non-recurring engineering fees from our connected vehicle services. 
  We expect other revenue to increase as our growing subscriber base drives higher U.S. Music Royalty Fees. 
  Operating Expenses 
  Revenue Share and Royalties   include distribution and content provider revenue share, royalties for transmitting content and web streaming, and advertising revenue share. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , revenue share and royalties were   $272,823   and   $238,620  , respectively,   an increase   of   14%  , or   $34,203  , and   increased   as a percentage of total revenue.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , revenue share and royalties were   $788,952   and   $783,115  , respectively,   an increase   of   1%  , or   $5,837  , but   decreased   as a percentage of total revenue.  The increase for the three and nine month period was due to overall greater revenues subject to royalty and revenue sharing arrangements, and a 5% increase in the statutory royalty rate applicable to our use of post-1972 recordings.  The increase in the nine month period was mitigated by the impact of $116,639 in expense recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 for the portion of the $210,000 settlement of the   Capitol Records LLC et al. v. Sirius XM Radio Inc  . lawsuit related to our use of pre-1972 sound recordings through September 30, 2015.  We have recorded approximately $29,654 related to this settlement through the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

We expect our revenue share and royalty costs to increase as our revenues grow and as the statutory royalty rate applicable to post-1972 sound recordings increases.  For the remainder of 2016 and in 2017, we expect to recognize $10,154 and $43,442, respectively, in expense related to the settlement relating to the use of pre-1972 sound recordings.  As determined by the Copyright Royalty Board, we have paid or will pay royalties for the use of certain post-1972 sound recordings on our satellite radio service of 10.0%, 10.5% and 11% in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. 
  Programming and Content   includes costs to acquire, create, promote and produce content. We have entered into various agreements with third parties for music and non-music programming that require us to pay license fees and other amounts. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , programming and content expenses were   $89,015   and   $75,707  , respectively,   an increase   of   18%  , or   $13,308  , and   increased   as a percentage of total revenue.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , programming and content expenses were   $257,760   and   $216,223  , respectively,   an increase   of   19%  , or $  41,537  , and   increased   as a percentage of total revenue.  The period over period increases were primarily due to renewed programming licenses as well as increased personnel related costs. 
  We expect our programming and content expenses to increase as we offer additional programming, and renew or replace expiring agreements. 
  Customer Service and Billing   includes costs associated with the operation and management of internal and third party customer service centers, and our subscriber management systems as well as billing and collection costs, bad debt expense, and transaction fees. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , customer service and billing expenses were   $94,923   and   $94,492  , respectively,   an increase   of less than 1%, or   $431  , but   decreased   as a percentage of total revenue.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , customer services and billing expenses were   $285,502   and   $278,521  , respectively,   an increase   of   3%  , or   $6,981  , but   decreased   as a percentage of total revenue.  The period over period increases were primarily due to costs associated with a higher subscriber base driving greater bad debt expenses, transaction fees, and call center costs, partially offset by lower personnel related costs and classifying wireless transmission costs related to our connected vehicle services to Satellite and transmission expense in 2016. 
  We expect our customer service and billing expenses to increase as our subscriber base grows. 
  Satellite and Transmission   consists of costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our terrestrial repeater networks; satellites; satellite telemetry, tracking and control systems; satellite uplink facilities; studios; and delivery of our Internet streaming and connected vehicle services. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , satellite and transmission expenses were   $22,224   and   $22,743  , respectively,   a decrease   of   2%  , or   $519  , and   decreased   as a percentage of total revenue.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , satellite and transmission expenses were   $80,609   and   $65,761  , respectively,   an increase   of   23%  , or   $14,848  , and   increased   as a percentage of revenue.  The decrease in the three month period was driven primarily by lower web streaming costs from insourcing certain activities and repeater costs, offset by the inclusion of wireless transmission costs related to our connected vehicle services that were previously recorded to Customer service and billing expense in 2015.  The increase for the nine month period was primarily due to the loss on disposal of certain obsolete satellite parts of $12,912, recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2016. 
  We expect satellite and transmission expenses, net of losses on disposals of assets, to remain relatively flat. 
  Cost of Equipment   includes costs from the sale of satellite radios, components and accessories and provisions for inventory allowance attributable to products purchased for resale in our direct to consumer distribution channels. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , cost of equipment was   $9,674   and   $9,246  , respectively,   an increase   of 5%, or   $428  , but   decreased   as a percentage of equipment revenue.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , cost of equipment was   $29,181   and   $29,021  , respectively,   an increase   of   1%  , or   $160  , but   decreased   as a percentage of equipment revenue. 
  We expect cost of equipment to fluctuate with changes in sales and inventory valuations. 
  Subscriber Acquisition Costs   include hardware subsidies paid to radio manufacturers, distributors and automakers; subsidies paid for chipsets and certain other components used in manufacturing radios; device royalties for certain radios and

chipsets; commissions paid to automakers and retailers; product warranty obligations; freight; and provisions for inventory allowances attributable to inventory consumed in our OEM and retail distribution channels. The majority of subscriber acquisition costs are incurred and expensed in advance of, or concurrent with, acquiring a subscriber. Subscriber acquisition costs do not include advertising costs, marketing, loyalty payments to distributors and dealers of satellite radios or revenue share payments to automakers and retailers of satellite radios. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , subscriber acquisition costs were   $120,111   and   $133,009  , respectively,   a decrease   of   10%  , or   $12,898  , and   decreased   as a percentage of total revenue.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , subscriber acquisition costs were   $381,516   and $  391,773  , respectively,   a decrease   of   3%  , or   $10,257  , and   decreased   as a percentage of total revenue.  The period over period decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was driven by lower OEM hardware subsidies, a contractual reduction to a subsidy rate, and lower subsidized costs related to the transition of chipsets, partially offset by higher radio installations.  The period over period decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was driven by a contractual reduction to a subsidy rate, and lower subsidized costs related to the transition of chipsets, partially offset by higher radio installations and related OEM hardware subsidies. 
  We expect subscriber acquisition costs to fluctuate with OEM installations and aftermarket volume; however, the cost of subsidized radio components is expected to decline.  We intend to continue to offer subsidies, commissions and other incentives to acquire subscribers. 
  Sales and Marketing   includes costs for marketing, advertising, media and production, including promotional events and sponsorships; cooperative marketing; and personnel. Marketing costs include expenses related to direct mail, outbound telemarketing and email communications. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , sales and marketing expenses were   $99,194   and   $90,541  , respectively,   an increase   of   10%  , or   $8,653  , and   increased   as a percentage of total revenue.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , sales and marketing expenses were   $279,278   and   $255,778  , respectively,   an increase   of   9%  , or   $23,500  , but   decreased   as a percentage of total revenue.  The period over period increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily due to increased subscriber retention and acquisition campaigns related to our subscriber growth as well as higher personnel costs. 
  We anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase as we expand programs to retain our existing subscribers, win back former subscribers and attract new subscribers.  
  Engineering, Design and Development   consists primarily of compensation and related costs to develop chipsets and new products and services, including streaming and connected vehicle services, research and development for broadcast information systems and costs associated with the incorporation of our radios into new vehicles manufactured by automakers. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , engineering, design and development expenses were   $19,254   and   $16,132  , respectively,   an increase   of   19%  , or   $3,122  , and   increased   as a percentage of total revenue.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , engineering, design and development expenses were   $57,588   and   $47,180  , respectively,   an increase   of   22%  , or   $10,408  , and   increased   as a percentage of total revenue.  The period over period increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were driven primarily by the inclusion of personnel related costs from our connected vehicle services that were previously recorded in Sales and marketing and General and administrative expense in 2015, partially offset by lower research and development costs. 
  We expect engineering, design and development expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to develop our infrastructure, products and services. 
  General and Administrative   primarily consists of compensation and related costs for personnel and facilities, and include costs related to our finance, legal, human resources and information technologies departments. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , general and administrative expenses were   $90,369   and   $67,234  , respectively,   an increase   of   34%  , or   $23,135  , and   increased   as a percentage of total revenue.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , general and administrative expenses were   $249,052   and   $219,194  , respectively,   an increase   of   14%  , or   $29,858  , and   increased   as a percentage of total revenue.  The period over period increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily driven by higher consulting and legal costs.  Costs in the three months ended September 30, 2015, benefited from insurance recoveries related to a legal settlement.

     Table of Contents  

We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as a result of, among other things, enhanced information technology, on-going legal costs and personnel costs to support the growth of our business. 
  Depreciation and Amortization   represents the recognition in earnings of the cost of assets used in operations, including our satellite constellations, property, equipment and intangible assets, over their estimated service lives. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , depreciation and amortization expense was   $67,880   and   $70,404  , respectively,   a decrease   of   4%  , or   $2,524  , and   decreased   as a percentage of total revenue.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , depreciation and amortization expense was   $202,215   and   $202,527  , respectively,   a decrease   of less than 1%, or   $312  , and   decreased   as a percentage of total revenue.  The decrease for the three month period was driven by certain satellites and software reaching the end of their estimated lives in 2015, partially offset by additional software and terrestrial repeater assets placed in service. 
  Other Income (Expense) 
  Interest Expense   includes interest on outstanding debt. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest expense was   $89,092   and   $76,624  , respectively,   an increase   of   16%  , or   $12,468  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest expense was   $250,888   and   $221,912  , respectively,   an increase   of   13%  , or   $28,976  .  The increase was primarily due to higher average debt during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  We expect interest expense to increase in future periods to the extent our total debt outstanding increases. 
  Other Income   primarily     includes realized gains and losses, interest income, and our share of the income or loss of Sirius XM Canada. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest and investment income was   $2,370   and   $4,133  , respectively.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest and investment income was   $15,733   and   $9,077  , respectively.  The income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was driven by our share of Sirius XM Canada s net income.  The nine months ended September 30, 2016 also included dividends received from Sirius XM Canada in excess of our investment.  Pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement, Sirius XM Canada did not pay any dividends during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was driven by the dividends received from Sirius XM Canada in excess of our investment. 
  Income Taxes 
  Income Tax Expense   includes the change in our deferred tax assets, foreign withholding taxes and current federal and state tax expenses. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , income tax expense was   $111,556   and   $112,543  , respectively.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , income tax expense was   $326,108   and   $296,893  , respectively.  
  Our effective tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   36.5%   and   37.6%  , respectively.  We estimate our annual effective tax rate for the year ending   December 31, 2016   will be approximately   32%   as we expect to recognize a Federal R D tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2016 relating to the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015.  Our effective tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   40.3%   and   44.2%  , respectively.  Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   was impacted by tax law changes in the District of Columbia and New York City.  The tax law change in the District of Columbia will reduce our future tax and thus we will use less of certain net operating losses in the future which resulted in a   $44,392   increase in our valuation allowance during the three months ended March 31, 2015.  The tax law change in New York City will increase certain net operating losses to be utilized in the future which resulted in a   $14,831   increase in our deferred tax asset during the three months ended June 30, 2015. 
   
  Key Financial and Operating Performance Metrics 
  In this section, we present certain financial performance measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( Non-GAAP ), which include free cash flow and adjusted

EBITDA.  We also present certain operating performance measures, which include average monthly revenue per subscriber, or ARPU; customer service and billing expenses, per average subscriber; and subscriber acquisition cost, or SAC, per installation.  To the extent applicable, these measures exclude the impact of share-based payment expense and certain purchase price accounting adjustments related to the merger of Sirius and XM (the "Merger").  Additionally, when applicable, our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow metrics exclude the effect of significant items that do not relate to the on-going performance of our business.  We use these Non-GAAP financial and operating performance measures to manage our business, to set operational goals and as a basis for determining performance-based compensation for our employees.  See accompanying glossary on pages   39   through   41   for more details and for the reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure (where applicable). 
  We believe these Non-GAAP financial and operating performance measures provide useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations. We believe investors find these Non-GAAP financial and operating performance measures useful in evaluating our core trends because they provide a direct view of our underlying contractual costs. We believe investors use our adjusted EBITDA to estimate our current enterprise value and to make investment decisions. We believe free cash flow provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our cash available for future subscriber acquisition and capital expenditures, to repurchase or retire debt, to acquire other companies and to evaluate our ability to return capital to stockholders.  By providing these Non-GAAP financial and operating performance measures, together with the reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure (where applicable), we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business and our results of operations. 
  Our Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for or superior to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, our Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures by other companies.  Please refer to the glossary (pages   39   through   41  ) for a further discussion of such Non-GAAP financial and operating performance measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure (where applicable).    Subscribers and subscription related revenues and expenses associated with our connected vehicle services are not included in our subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.

    Amounts may not sum as a result of rounding. 
     The following table contains our Non-GAAP financial and operating performance measures which are based on our adjusted results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:     

(a) 
    Amounts may not sum as a result of rounding. 
     Subscribers.   At   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   31.0   million subscribers,   an increase   of   2.0   million subscribers, or   7%  , from the approximately   29.0   million subscribers as of   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in total subscribers was primarily due to growth in our self-pay subscriber base, which increased   1.7 million  .  The increase in self-pay subscribers is primarily from original and subsequent owner trial conversions and subscriber win back programs, partially offset by deactivations.  Our increase in paid promotional subscribers of   320 thousand   subscribers resulted from the shipment of additional vehicles by OEMs offering paid trials. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , net additions were   345   thousand and   525   thousand, respectively,   a decrease   of   34%  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , net additions were   1,397 thousand   and   1,649 thousand  , respectively,   a decrease   of   15%  .  The period over period decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to a decrease in net additions of paid promotional subscribers as a result of slower growth in vehicle sales.  Self-pay net additions increased slightly during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and decreased   4%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the decrease in self-pay net additions was due to increases in deactivations from our larger subscriber base which were largely offset by increases in trial conversions and subscriber win back programs. 
  Average Self-pay Monthly Churn   is derived by dividing the monthly average of self-pay deactivations for the period by the average number of self-pay subscribers for the period. (See accompanying glossary on pages   39   through   41   for more details.)

     Table of Contents  

For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our average self-pay monthly churn rate was   1.9%  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our average self-pay monthly churn rate was   1.8%  .  
  New Vehicle Consumer Conversion Rate   is the percentage of owners and lessees of new vehicles that receive our service and convert to become self-paying subscribers after an initial promotional period. The metric excludes rental and fleet vehicles.      (See accompanying glossary on pages   39   through   41   for more details). 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our new vehicle consumer conversion rate was   40%   and   41%  , respectively.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our new vehicle consumer conversion rate was   39%   and   41%  , respectively.  The period over period   decrease   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increased vehicle penetration rate as well as lower conversion of first-time buyers and lessees of satellite radio enabled cars.  
  ARPU   is derived from total earned subscriber revenue (excluding revenue derived from our connected vehicle services), net advertising revenue and other subscription-related revenue, divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the daily weighted average number of subscribers for the period. (See the accompanying glossary on pages   39   through   41   for more details.) 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , ARPU was   $13.04   and   $12.67  , respectively.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , ARPU was   $12.83   and   $12.45  , respectively.  The period over period   increase   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was driven primarily by increases in certain of our subscription and other subscription-related rates, partially offset by growth in subscription discounts offered through customer acquisition and retention programs. 
  SAC, Per Installation,   is derived from subscriber acquisition costs and margins from the sale of radios, components and accessories, divided by the number of satellite radio installations in new vehicles and shipments of aftermarket radios for the period. (See the accompanying glossary on pages   39   through   41   for more details.) 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , SAC, per installation, was   $28   and   $34  , respectively.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , SAC, per installation, was   $31   and   $33  , respectively.  The period over period decrease for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was driven by lower OEM hardware subsidy rates as well as lower subsidized costs related to the transition of chipsets.  Additionally, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, subscriber acquisition costs benefited approximately $2.00 per installation from a contractual reduction to a subsidy rate. 
  Customer Service and Billing Expenses, Per Average Subscriber,   is derived from total customer service and billing expenses, excluding connected vehicle customer service and billing expenses and share-based payment expense, divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the daily weighted average number of subscribers for the period. (See the accompanying glossary on pages   39   through   41   for more details.) 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , customer service and billing expenses, per average subscriber, was   $0.97   and   $1.00  , respectively.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , customer service and billing expenses, per average subscriber, was   $0.98   and   $1.00  , respectively. The period over period decrease for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily related to efficiencies achieved from call center process enhancements and lower personnel related costs, partially offset by increased bad debt expense and transaction fees per subscriber. 
  Adjusted EBITDA.   EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization.  Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of other income, other non-cash charges, such as certain purchase price accounting adjustments, share-based payment expense, and loss on disposal of assets and settlements related to the historical use of pre-1972 sound recordings. (See the accompanying glossary on pages   39   through   41   for a reconciliation to GAAP and for more details.) 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , adjusted EBITDA was   $491,892   and   $447,194  , respectively,   an increase   of   10%  , or   $44,698  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , adjusted EBITDA was   $1,401,024   and   $1,261,382  , respectively,   an increase   of   11%  , or   $139,642  .  The increase was due to growth in revenues primarily as a result of the increase in our subscriber base and certain of our subscription rates, partially offset by higher revenue share and royalties costs due to growth in our revenues, higher programming and content costs associated with renewed agreements, higher sales and marketing costs associated with growth in our subscriber base, and higher general and administrative costs.

Free Cash Flow   includes cash provided by operations, net of additions to property and equipment, and restricted and other investment activity, and excluding the $210,000 pre-1972 sound recordings legal settlement payment made in 2015. (See the accompanying glossary on pages   39   through   41   for a reconciliation to GAAP and for more details.) 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , free cash flow was   $356,527   and   $368,899  , respectively,   a decrease   of   $12,372  , or   3%  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , free cash flow was   $1,079,690   and   $1,016,045  , respectively,   an increase   of   $63,645   or   6%  .  The decrease for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was driven by additions to property and equipment resulting primarily from new satellite construction, and a payment of approximately $22,400, net of insurance recoveries, in connection with the settlement of class action suits alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, partially offset by higher net cash provided by operating activities.  The increase for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was primarily driven by higher net cash provided by operating activities resulting from higher collections from subscribers; partially offset by an increase in additions to property and equipment resulting primarily from new satellite construction and the payment of approximately $22,400, net of insurance recoveries, in connection with the settlement of class action suits alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 
  The following table presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the periods set forth below: 

Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 
  Cash flows provided by operating activities   increased   by   $315,150   to   $1,216,104   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $900,954   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Our largest source of cash provided by operating activities is generated by subscription and subscription-related revenues.  We also generate cash from the sale of advertising on certain non-music channels and the sale of satellite radios, components and accessories.  Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include revenue share and royalty payments to distributors, programming and content providers, and payments to radio manufacturers, distributors and automakers. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include payments to vendors to service, maintain and acquire subscribers, general corporate expenditures, and compensation and related costs. 
  Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
  Cash flows used in investing activities are primarily additional spending to construct replacement satellites, improve our terrestrial repeater network and for capitalized software.  In 2015, our cash flows used in investing activities also included an increase to our letters of credit issued for the benefit of lessors of certain of our office space. 
  Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities 
  Cash flows used in financing activities consists of the issuance and repayment of long-term debt, cash used in our stock option program and the purchase of common stock under our share repurchase program.  Proceeds from long-term debt, related party debt and equity issuances have been used to fund our operations, construct and launch new satellites and invest in other infrastructure improvements. 
  Cash flows provided by financing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were due to the issuance of $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2026 and borrowings under the Credit Facility.  Cash flows used in financing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were primarily due to the purchase and

retirement of shares of our common stock under our repurchase program for   $1,225,284   and repayments of borrowings under the Credit Facility.  Cash flows provided by financing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were due to the issuance of $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2025 and borrowings under the Credit Facility.  Cash flows used in financing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were primarily due to the purchase and retirement of shares of our common stock under our repurchase program for   $1,647,728   and repayments of borrowings under the Credit Facility. 
  Future Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements 
  Based upon our current business plans, we expect to fund operating expenses, capital expenditures, including the construction of replacement satellites, working capital requirements, legal settlements, interest payments, taxes and scheduled maturities of our debt with existing cash, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $1,750,000   was available for future borrowing under our Credit Facility.  On October 3, 2016, we redeemed   $650,000   in principal amount of our outstanding   5.875%   Notes for an approximate purchase price of   $669,097  , including premium.  This redemption was funded with   $359,097   of Cash and cash equivalents and   $310,000   of borrowings under our Credit Facility.  We believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents as well as debt capacity to cover our estimated short-term and long-term funding needs, as well as fund stock repurchases and strategic opportunities. 
  Our ability to meet our debt and other obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors. We continually review our operations for opportunities to adjust the timing of expenditures to ensure that sufficient resources are maintained. 
  We regularly evaluate our business plans and strategy. These evaluations often result in changes to our business plans and strategy, some of which may be material and significantly change our cash requirements. These changes in our business plans or strategy may include: the acquisition of unique or compelling programming; the development and introduction of new features or services; significant new or enhanced distribution arrangements; investments in infrastructure, such as satellites, equipment or radio spectrum; and acquisitions, including acquisitions that are not directly related to our satellite radio business. 
  Capital Return Program 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our board of directors had approved for repurchase an aggregate of $8,000,000 of our common stock.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our cumulative repurchases since December 2012 under our stock repurchase program totaled   2,098,548   shares for   $7,515,223  , and   $484,777   remained available under our stock repurchase program.  
  On October 26, 2016, our board of directors approved an additional   $2,000,000   for repurchase of our common stock.  The new approval increases the amount of common stock that we have been authorized to repurchase to an aggregate of   $10,000,000  .  Shares of common stock may be purchased from time to time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, including in accelerated stock repurchase transactions and transactions with Liberty Media and its affiliates.  We intend to fund the additional repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and future borrowings. 
  On October 26, 2016, our board of directors also declared the first quarterly dividend on our common stock in the amount of   $0.01   per share of common stock payable on November 30, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 9, 2016.  Our board of directors expects that this dividend will be the first of regular quarterly dividends, in an aggregate annual amount of   $0.04   per share of common stock. 
  Debt Covenants 
  The indentures governing Sirius XM's senior notes, and the agreement governing the Credit Facility include restrictive covenants.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with such covenants.  For a discussion of our  Debt Covenants,  refer to Note 10 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed in Note 13 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Glossary 
  Adjusted EBITDA     - EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. We adjust EBITDA to exclude the impact of other income as well as certain other charges discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary Non-GAAP financial measures we use to (i) evaluate the performance of our on-going core operating results period over period, (ii) base our internal budgets and (iii) compensate management. Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial measure that excludes (if applicable):  (i) certain adjustments as a result of the purchase price accounting for the   Merger,   (ii) share-based payment expense and (iii) other significant operating expense (income) that do not relate to the on-going performance of our business.  We believe adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the underlying trend of our operating performance, which provides useful information about our business apart from the costs associated with our capital structure and purchase price accounting. We believe investors find this Non-GAAP financial measure useful when analyzing our results and comparing our operating performance to the performance of other communications, entertainment and media companies. We believe investors use adjusted EBITDA to estimate our current enterprise value and to make investment decisions. Because of large capital investments in our satellite radio system our results of operations reflect significant charges for depreciation expense. We believe the exclusion of share-based payment expense is useful as it is not directly related to the operational conditions of our business.  We also believe the exclusion of settlements related to the historical use of pre-1972 sound recordings and loss on disposal of assets is useful as it does not represent an expense incurred as part of our normal operations for the period.    
  Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our statements of comprehensive income of certain expenses, including share-based payment expense and certain purchase price accounting for the   Merger.   We endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the Non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the Non-GAAP measure.  Investors that wish to compare and evaluate our operating results after giving effect for these costs, should refer to net income as disclosed in our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Since adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial performance measure, our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be susceptible to varying calculations; may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies; and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to the adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows:

ARPU     - is derived from total earned subscriber revenue, advertising revenue and other subscription-related revenue, excluding revenue associated with our connected vehicle services, divided by     the number of months in the period, divided by the daily weighted average number of subscribers for the period. Other subscription-related revenue includes the U.S. Music Royalty Fee.  ARPU is calculated as follows:    

Average self-pay monthly churn     - is defined as the monthly average of self-pay deactivations for the period divided by the average number of self-pay subscribers for the period.    
  Customer service and billing expenses, per average subscriber     - is derived from total customer service and billing expenses, excluding connected vehicle customer service and billing expenses and share-based payment expense, divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the daily weighted average number of subscribers for the period. We believe the exclusion of share-based payment expense in our calculation of customer service and billing expenses, per average subscriber, is useful as share-based payment expense is not directly related to the operational conditions that give rise to variations in the components of our customer service and billing expenses. Customer service and billing expenses, per average subscriber, is calculated as follows:

Free cash flow     -  is derived from cash flow provided by operating activities, net of additions to property and equipment, restricted and other investment activity and the return of capital from investment in unconsolidated entity.   Free cash flow is a metric that our management and board of directors use to evaluate the cash generated by our operations, net of capital expenditures and other investment activity and significant items that do not relate to the on-going performance of our business.  In a capital intensive business, with significant investments in satellites, we look at our operating cash flow, net of these investing cash outflows, to determine cash available for future subscriber acquisition and capital expenditures, to repurchase or retire debt, to acquire other companies and to evaluate our ability to return capital to stockholders. We believe free cash flow is an indicator of the long-term financial stability of our business.  Free cash flow, which is reconciled to  Net cash provided by operating activities,  is a Non-GAAP financial measure.  This measure can be calculated by deducting amounts under the captions  Additions to property and equipment  and deducting or adding Restricted and other investment activity from  Net cash provided by operating activities  from the unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows, adjusted for any significant legal settlements.  We have excluded the     $210,000     payment related to the pre-1972 sound recordings legal settlement from our free cash flow calculation in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Free cash flow should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial performance measures and may not be comparable to free cash flow measures presented by other companies.  Free cash flow should be viewed as a supplemental measure rather than an alternative measure of cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP.  Free cash flow is limited and does not represent remaining cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt maturities. We believe free cash flow provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our current cash flow, along with other GAAP measures (such as cash flows from operating and investing activities), to determine our financial condition, and to compare our operating performance to other communications, entertainment and media companies.  Free cash flow is calculated as follows:    

New vehicle consumer conversion rate     - is defined as the percentage of owners and lessees of new vehicles that receive our satellite radio service and convert to become self-paying subscribers after the initial promotion period. At the time satellite radio enabled vehicles are sold or leased, the owners or lessees generally receive trial subscriptions ranging from three to twelve months. We measure conversion rate three months after the period in which the trial service ends. The metric excludes rental and fleet vehicles.    
  Subscriber acquisition cost, per installation     - or SAC, per installation, is derived from subscriber acquisition costs and margins from the sale of radios and accessories, divided by the number of satellite radio installations in new vehicles and shipments of aftermarket radios for the period.  SAC, per installation, is calculated as follows:

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not hold or issue any free-standing derivatives.  We hold investments in money market funds and certificates of deposit.  These securities are consistent with the objectives contained within our investment policy.  The basic objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of capital, maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements and maximizing yield. 
  Our debt includes fixed rate instruments and the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Sirius XM's borrowings under the Credit Facility carry a variable interest rate based on LIBOR plus an applicable rate based on its debt to operating cash flow ratio.  We currently do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
   
           ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.  The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including James E. Meyer, our Chief Executive Officer, and David J. Frear, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  .  
       
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
           ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     In the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant or party to various claims and lawsuits, including those discussed below. 
  Telephone Consumer Protection Act Suits  .  We are a defendant in several purported class action suits that allege that we, or call center vendors acting on our behalf, made calls which violate provisions of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the  TCPA ).  The plaintiffs in these actions allege, among other things, that we called mobile phones using an automatic telephone dialing system without the consumer s prior consent or, alternatively, after the consumer revoked his or her prior consent.  In one of the actions, the plaintiff also alleges that we violated the TCPA s call time restrictions and, in one of the other actions, the plaintiff, also alleges that we violated the TCPA s do not call restrictions.  These purported class action cases are titled   Erik Knutson v. Sirius XM Radio Inc.  , No. 12-cv-0418-AJB-NLS (S.D. Cal.),   Francis W. Hooker v. Sirius XM Radio Inc.  , No. 4:13-cv-3 (E.D. Va.),   Yefim Elikman v. Sirius XM Radio Inc. and Career Horizons, Inc.  , No. 1:15-cv-02093 (N.D. Ill.), and   Anthony Parker v. Sirius XM Radio Inc.  , No. 8:15-cv-01710-JSM-EAJ (M.D. Fla), and are described in Item 3., Legal Proceedings, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  We have entered into an agreement to settle these purported class action suits.  The settlement is expected to resolve the claims of consumers beginning in February 2008 relating to telemarketing calls to their mobile telephones.  As part of this settlement, we have made a   $35 million   payment to a settlement fund (from which notice, administration and other costs and attorneys  fees will be paid), and are offering participating class members the option of receiving three months of our Select service for no charge, and will enter into agreements to make modifications to the practices of certain call center vendors.  The settlement is subject to final court approval, which cannot be assured. 
  Pre-1972 Sound Recording Matters  .  In August 2013, SoundExchange, Inc. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we underpaid royalties for statutory licenses during the 2007-2012 period in violation of the regulations established by the Copyright Royalty Board for that period.  SoundExchange principally alleges that we improperly reduced our calculation of gross revenues, on which the royalty payments are based, by deducting non-recognized revenue attributable to pre-1972 recordings and Premier package revenue that is not  separately charged  as required by the regulations.  SoundExchange is seeking compensatory damages of not less than   $50 million   and up to   $100 million   or more, payment of late fees and interest, and attorneys  fees and costs. 
  In August 2014, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted our motion to dismiss the complaint without prejudice on the grounds that the case properly should be pursued before the Copyright Royalty Board rather than the district court.  In December 2014, SoundExchange filed a petition with the Copyright Royalty Board requesting an order interpreting the applicable regulations.  We have submitted legal briefs and other evidence supporting our position that our payments and practices complied with the regulations established by the Copyright Royalty Board for statutory licenses during the 2007-2012 period or, in the event that the Judges should find that the applicable regulations were unclear, that the Judges should clarify the regulations and confirm that our payments and practices complied with the regulations for that period.  Briefing in this matter is complete and a decision from the Copyright Royalty Board is pending. 
  This matter is titled   SoundExchange, Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio, Inc.  , No.13-cv-1290-RJL (D.D.C.), and   Determination of Rates and Terms for Preexisting Subscription Services and Satellite Digital Audio Radio Services,   United States Copyright Royalty Board, No. 2006-1 CRB DSTRA.  Information concerning the action is publicly available in filings under the docket numbers.  The outcome of this matter is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  No provision was made for losses to the extent such are not probable and estimable.  We believe we have substantial defenses to the claims asserted, and intend to defend this action vigorously. 
  Other Matters  .  In the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant in various other lawsuits and arbitration proceedings, including derivative actions; actions filed by subscribers, both on behalf of themselves and on a class action basis; former employees; parties to contracts or leases; and owners of patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property.  None of these other matters, in our opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 2.    
    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
          
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our board of directors had approved for repurchase an aggregate of   $8.0 billion   of our common stock.  On October 26, 2016, our board of directors approved an additional   $2.0 billion   for repurchase of our common stock.  Our board of directors did not establish an end date for this stock repurchase program.  Shares of common stock may be purchased from time to time on the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, in privately negotiated transactions, including transactions with Liberty Media and its affiliates, or otherwise.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our cumulative repurchases since December 2012 under our stock repurchase program totaled   2.1 billion   shares for   $7.5 billion  , and   $0.5 billion   remained available under our stock repurchase program.  The size and timing of these purchases will be based on a number of factors, including price and business and market conditions.

  ACT OF 2002 
  In connection with the Quarterly Report of Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (the  Company ) on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016   as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the  Report ), I, James E.
