As used in this Form 10-Q,  MLIC,  the  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, a New York corporation incorporated in 1868, and its subsidiaries. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (MetLife, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates,  MetLife ). 
  Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe  and other words and terms of similar meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results. 
  Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the actual future results of MLIC. These statements are based on current expectations and the current economic environment. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that might cause such differences include the risks, uncertainties and other factors identified in Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These factors include: (1) difficult conditions in the global capital markets; (2) increased volatility and disruption of the global capital and credit markets, which may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and access capital, including through credit facilities, generate fee income and market-related revenue and finance statutory reserve requirements and may require us to pledge collateral or make payments related to declines in value of specified assets, including assets supporting risks ceded to certain affiliated captive reinsurers or hedging arrangements associated with those risks; (3) exposure to global financial and capital market risks, including as a result of the pending withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, other disruption in Europe and possible withdrawal of one or more countries from the Euro zone; (4) impact on us of comprehensive financial services regulation reform, including potential regulation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank systemically important financial institution, or otherwise; (5) numerous rulemaking initiatives required or permitted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which may impact how we conduct our business, including those compelling the liquidation of certain financial institutions; (6) regulatory, legislative or tax changes relating to our insurance or other operations that may affect the cost of, or demand for, our products or services, or increase the cost or administrative burdens of providing benefits to employees; (7) adverse results or other consequences from litigation, arbitration or regulatory investigations; (8) our ability to address difficulties, unforeseen liabilities, asset impairments, or rating agency actions arising from (a) business acquisitions and integrating and managing the growth of such acquired businesses, (b) dispositions of businesses via sale, initial public offering, spin-off or otherwise, including failure to achieve projected operational benefit from such transactions; (c) entry into joint ventures, or (d) legal entity reorganizations; (9) potential liquidity and other risks resulting from our participation in a securities lending program and other transactions; (10) investment losses and defaults, and changes to investment valuations; (11) changes in assumptions related to investment valuations, deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements, value of business acquired or goodwill; (12) impairments of goodwill and realized losses or market value impairments to illiquid assets; (13) defaults on our mortgage loans; (14) the defaults or deteriorating credit of other financial institutions that could adversely affect us; (15) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (16) downgrades in our claims paying ability, financial strength or credit ratings, or MetLife, Inc. s credit ratings; (17) a deterioration in the experience of the closed block established in connection with the reorganization of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company; (18) availability and effectiveness of reinsurance, hedging or indemnification arrangements, as well as any default or failure of counterparties to perform; (19) differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserving assumptions; (20) ineffectiveness of MetLife s risk management policies and procedures; (21) catastrophe losses; (22) increasing cost and limited market capacity for statutory life insurance reserve financings; (23) heightened competition, including with respect to pricing, entry of new competitors, consolidation of distributors, the development of new products by new and existing competitors, and for personnel; (24) exposure to losses related to variable annuity guarantee benefits, including from significant and sustained downturns or extreme volatility in equity markets, reduced interest rates, unanticipated policyholder behavior, mortality or longevity, and any adjustment for nonperformance risk; (25) changes in accounting standards, practices and/or policies; (26) increased expenses relating to pension and postretirement benefit plans for employees and retirees of MetLife, as well as health care and other employee benefits; (27) inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others; (28) difficulties in marketing and distributing products through our distribution channels; (29) the effects of business disruption or economic contraction due to disasters such as terrorist attacks, cyberattacks, other hostilities, or natural

catastrophes, including any related impact on the value of our investment portfolio, MetLife s disaster recovery systems, cyber- or other information security systems and management continuity planning; (30) any failure to protect the confidentiality of client information; (31) the effectiveness of MetLife s programs and practices in avoiding giving associates incentives to take excessive risks; and (32) other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
  Metropolitan Life Insurance Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-looking statement if Metropolitan Life Insurance Company later becomes aware that such statement is not likely to be achieved. Please consult any further disclosures Metropolitan Life Insurance Company makes on related subjects in reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
   
  Business 
  Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries (collectively,  MLIC  or the  Company ) is a provider of life insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (MetLife, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates,  MetLife ). In anticipation of MetLife, Inc. s plan to separate a substantial portion of its former Retail segment, as well as certain portions of its former Corporate Benefit Funding segment and Corporate   Other (the  Separation ), in the third quarter of 2016, the Company reorganized its businesses into   two   segments: U.S. and MetLife Holdings. See Note 2 for further information on the reorganization of the Company s segments in the third quarter of 2016, which was applied retrospectively. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to the Company s business and operations. Actual results could differ from estimates. 
  Consolidation 
  The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, as well as partnerships and joint ventures in which the Company has control, and variable interest entities ( VIEs ) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
  The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity securities when it has significant influence or at least 20% interest and for real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests ( investees ) when it has more than a minor ownership interest or more than a minor influence over the investee s operations, but does not have a controlling financial interest. The Company generally recognizes its share of the investee s earnings on a three-month lag in instances where the investee s financial information is not sufficiently timely or when the investee s reporting period differs from the Company s reporting period. The Company uses the cost method of accounting for investments in which it has virtually no influence over the investee s operations. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain amounts in the prior year periods  interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes thereto have been reclassified to conform with the   2016   presentation as discussed throughout the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Since the Company is a member of a controlled group of affiliated companies, its results may not be indicative of those of a stand-alone entity. 
  The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented in conformity with GAAP. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of full year performance. The   December 31, 2015   consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements included in Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  2015 Annual Report ), which include all disclosures required by GAAP. Therefore, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the   2015   Annual Report.

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement 
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company retrospectively adopted new guidance relating to the consolidation of certain entities. The objective of the new standard is to improve targeted areas of the consolidation guidance and to reduce the number of consolidation models. The new consolidation standard provides guidance on how a reporting entity (i) evaluates whether the entity should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (ii) assesses whether the fees paid to a decisionmaker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (iii) assesses the variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting entity. The new guidance also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities. The adoption of the new guidance did not impact which entities are consolidated by the Company. The consolidated VIE assets and liabilities and unconsolidated VIE carrying amounts and maximum exposure to loss as of September 30, 2016, disclosed in Note   6  , reflect the application of the new guidance. 
  Future Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance on consolidation evaluation for entities under common control (Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-17,     Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control)  . The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and should be applied on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance does not change the characteristics of a primary beneficiary under current GAAP. It changes how a reporting entity evaluates whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decisionmaker of a VIE handles indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on tax accounting for intra-entity transfers of assets (ASU 2016  -  16,     Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  ). The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted in the first interim or annual reporting period. Current guidance prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The new guidance requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Also, the guidance eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on cash flow statement presentation (ASU 2016-15,     Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ). The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. This ASU addresses diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (ASU 2016-13,     Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments)  . The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. This ASU replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with one that reflects expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses should be based on historical loss information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on leasing transactions (ASU 2016-02,     Leases - Topic 842  ). The new guidance is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and requires a modified retrospective transition approach which includes a number of optional practical expedients. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current guidance, leases would be classified as finance or operating leases. However, unlike current guidance, the new guidance will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Lessor accounting will remain largely unchanged from current guidance except for certain targeted changes. The new guidance will also require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

  Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)   (continued) 
  1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)  

In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance (ASU 2016-01,     Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities)     on the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for the instrument-specific credit risk provision. The new guidance changes the current accounting guidance related to (i) the classification and measurement of certain equity investments, (ii) the presentation of changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option ( FVO ) that are due to instrument-specific credit risk, and (iii) certain disclosures associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on short-duration insurance contracts (ASU 2015-09,     Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts  ). The amendments in this new guidance are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new guidance should be applied retrospectively by providing comparative disclosures for each period presented, except for those requirements that apply only to the current period. The new guidance requires insurance entities to provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about initial claim estimates and subsequent adjustments to these estimates, including information on: (i) reconciling from the claim development table to the balance sheet liability, (ii) methodologies and judgments in estimating claims, and (iii) the timing, and frequency of claims. The adoption will not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements other than expanded disclosures in Note   3  . 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard (ASU 2014-09,     Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years and should be applied retrospectively. In August 2015, the FASB amended the guidance to defer the effective date by one year, effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The new guidance will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP; however, it will not impact the accounting for insurance contracts, leases, financial instruments and guarantees. For those contracts that are impacted by the new guidance, the guidance will require an entity to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled, in exchange for those goods or services. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
  2. Segment Information 
   
  In anticipation of the Separation, in the third quarter of 2016, the Company reorganized its businesses into   two   segments: U.S. and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate   Other. These changes were applied retrospectively and did not have an impact on total consolidated net income (loss) or operating earnings in the prior periods. 
  On January 12, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced its plan to pursue the Separation. Additionally, on July 21, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced that following the Separation, the separated business will be rebranded as  Brighthouse Financial.  On October 5, 2016, Brighthouse Financial, Inc., a subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. ( Brighthouse ), filed a registration statement on Form 10 (the  Form 10 ) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The information statement filed as an exhibit to the Form 10, disclosed that MetLife, Inc. intends to include MetLife Insurance Company USA ( MetLife USA ), New England Life Insurance Company ( NELICO ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, First MetLife Investors Insurance Company     ( First MetLife )  , MetLife Advisers, LLC and certain captive reinsurance companies in the proposed separated business and distribute at least 80.1% of the shares of Brighthouse s common stock on a     pro rata     basis to the holders of MetLife, Inc. common stock.    
   The ultimate form and timing of the Separation will be influenced by a number of factors, including regulatory considerations and economic conditions. MetLife continues to evaluate and pursue structural alternatives for the proposed Separation. The Separation remains subject to certain conditions, including among others, obtaining final approval from the MetLife, Inc.

  2. Segment Information (continued) 

U.S  . 
  The U.S. segment offers a broad range of protection products and services aimed at serving the financial needs of customers throughout their lives. These products are sold to corporations and their respective employees, other institutions and their respective members, as well as individuals. The U.S. segment is organized into two businesses: Group Benefits and Retirement and Income Solutions. 
             
    The Group Benefits business offers insurance products and services which include life, dental, group short- and long-term disability, individual disability, accidental death and dismemberment, critical illness, vision and accident   health coverages, as well as prepaid legal plans. This business also sells administrative services-only arrangements to some employers. 
                
    The Retirement and Income Solutions business offers a broad range of annuity and investment products, including guaranteed interest contracts and other stable value products, income annuities and separate account contracts for the investment management of defined benefit and defined contribution plan assets. This business also includes structured settlements and certain products to fund postretirement benefits and company-, bank- or trust-owned life insurance used to finance nonqualified benefit programs for executives. 
     MetLife Holdings 
  The MetLife Holdings segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses no longer actively marketed by the Company in the U.S. These products and businesses include variable life, universal life, term life, whole life, variable annuities, fixed annuities and index-linked annuities. The MetLife Holdings segment also includes the Company s discontinued long-term care businesses.  
  Corporate   Other 
  Corporate   Other contains the excess capital, as well as certain charges and activities, not allocated to the segments, including enterprise-wide strategic initiative restructuring charges and various start-up businesses (including the investment management business through which the Company offers fee-based investment management services to institutional clients, as well as the direct to consumer portion of the U.S. Direct business). Corporate   Other also includes the Company s ancillary international operations, the businesses of the Company that MetLife, Inc. plans to separate and include in Brighthouse Financial and interest expense related to the majority of the Company s outstanding debt, as well as expenses associated with certain legal proceedings and income tax audit issues. In addition, Corporate   Other includes the elimination of intersegment amounts, which generally relate to intersegment loans, which bear interest rates commensurate with related borrowings. 
  Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies 
  Operating earnings is used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is also the Company s GAAP measure of segment performance and is reported below. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). The Company believes the presentation of operating earnings as the Company measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings allows analysis of the Company s performance and facilitates comparisons to industry results. 
  Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. 
  The financial measures of operating revenues and operating expenses focus on the Company s primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends, and revenues and costs related to non-core products and divested businesses and certain entities required to be consolidated under GAAP. Also, these measures exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife and are referred to as divested businesses. Operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses).

The following additional adjustments are made to revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues: 
             
    Universal life and investment-type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses) and certain variable annuity guaranteed minimum income benefits ( GMIBs ) fees ( GMIB Fees  and 
                
    Net investment income: (i) includes investment hedge adjustments which represent earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (ii) excludes post-tax operating earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method and (iii) excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP. 
     The following additional adjustments are made to expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating expenses: 
             
    Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends excludes: (i) changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets, (iii) benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs ( GMIB Costs ) and (iv) market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts ( Market Value Adjustments  
                
    Interest credited to policyholder account balances includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; 
                
    Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ( DAC ) and value of business acquired ( VOBA ) excludes amounts related to: (i) net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) GMIB Fees and GMIB Costs and (iii) Market Value Adjustments; 
                
    Interest expense on debt excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP; and 
                
    Other expenses excludes costs related to noncontrolling interests and goodwill impairments. 
     The tax impact of the adjustments mentioned above are calculated net of the U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate, which could differ from the Company s effective tax rate. 
  Set forth in the tables below is certain financial information with respect to the Company s segments, as well as Corporate   Other, for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016     and     2015  . The segment accounting policies are the same as those used to prepare the Company s consolidated financial statements, except for operating earnings adjustments as defined above. In addition, segment accounting policies include the method of capital allocation described below. 
  Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in MetLife s and the Company s business. 
  MetLife s economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. MetLife s management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards. 
  Segment net investment income is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact the Company s consolidated net investment income, net income (loss) or operating earnings. 
  Net investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment s specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company s product pricing.

  Guarantees 
  As discussed in Notes   1   and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2015 Annual Report, the Company issues variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits. Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ( GMABs ), the non-life-contingent portion of guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ( GMWBs ) and the portion of certain GMIBs that do not require annuitization are accounted for as embedded derivatives in policyholder account balances and are further discussed in Note   7  . 
  The Company also issues other annuity contracts that apply a lower rate on funds deposited if the contractholder elects to surrender the contract for cash and a higher rate if the contractholder elects to annuitize. These guarantees include benefits that are payable in the event of death, maturity or at annuitization. Certain other annuity contracts contain guaranteed annuitization benefits that may be above what would be provided by the current account value of the contract. Additionally, the Company issues universal and variable life contracts where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder a secondary guarantee or a guaranteed paid-up benefit.

__________________ 
           (1) 
    The Company s annuity and life contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract. Therefore, the amounts listed above may not be mutually exclusive. 
              (2) 
    Includes the contractholder s investments in the general account and separate account, if applicable. 
              (3) 
    Defined as the death benefit less the total account value, as of the balance sheet date. It represents the amount of the claim that the Company would incur if death claims were filed on all contracts on the balance sheet date and includes any additional contractual claims associated with riders purchased to assist with covering income taxes payable upon death. 
              (4) 
    Defined as the amount (if any) that would be required to be added to the total account value to purchase a lifetime income stream, based on current annuity rates, equal to the minimum amount provided under the guaranteed benefit. This amount represents the Company s potential economic exposure to such guarantees in the event all contractholders were to annuitize on the balance sheet date, even though the contracts contain terms that allow annuitization of the guaranteed amount only after the 10th anniversary of the contract, which not all contractholders have achieved. 
              (5) 
    Defined as either the excess of the upper tier, adjusted for a profit margin, less the lower tier, as of the balance sheet date or the amount (if any) that would be required to be added to the total account value to purchase a lifetime income stream, based on current annuity rates, equal to the minimum amount provided under the guaranteed benefit. These amounts represent the Company s potential economic exposure to such guarantees in the event all contractholders were to annuitize on the balance sheet date. 
              (6) 
    Defined as the guarantee amount less the account value, as of the balance sheet date. It represents the amount of the claim that the Company would incur if death claims were filed on all contracts on the balance sheet date.

5. Closed Block 
   
  On April 7, 2000 (the  Demutualization Date ), Metropolitan Life Insurance Company converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New York Superintendent of Insurance approving Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s plan of reorganization, as amended (the  Plan of Reorganization ). On the Demutualization Date, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company established a closed block for the benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. 
  Experience within the closed block, in particular mortality and investment yields, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses, directly impact the policyholder dividend obligation. Amortization of the closed block DAC, which resides outside of the closed block, is based upon cumulative actual and expected earnings within the closed block. Accordingly, the Company s net income continues to be sensitive to the actual performance of the closed block. 
  Closed block assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are combined on a line-by-line basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular item.

  Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Available-for-Sale by Sector 
  The following table presents the fixed maturity and equity securities available-for-sale ( AFS ) by sector. Redeemable preferred stock is reported within U.S. corporate and foreign corporate fixed maturity securities and non-redeemable preferred stock is reported within equity securities. Included within fixed maturity securities are structured securities including residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ), commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) and asset-backed securities ( ABS ) (collectively,  Structured Securities ). 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    The noncredit loss component of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) losses for RMBS was in an unrealized gain position of   $6 million   at   September 30, 2016   due to increases in estimated fair value subsequent to initial recognition of noncredit losses on such securities. See also    Net Unrealized Investment Gains (Losses).  
     The Company held non-income producing fixed maturity securities with an estimated fair value of   $38 million   and   $3 million   with unrealized gains (losses) of   ($2) million   and less than   $1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Maturities of Fixed Maturity Securities 
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities, by contractual maturity date, were as follows at   September 30, 2016  :

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to the exercise of call or prepayment options. Fixed maturity securities not due at a single maturity date have been presented in the year of final contractual maturity. Structured Securities are shown separately, as they are not due at a single maturity. 
   
  Continuous Gross Unrealized Losses for Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities AFS by Sector 
  The following table presents the estimated fair value and gross unrealized losses of fixed maturity and equity securities AFS in an unrealized loss position, aggregated by sector and by length of time that the securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at: 

Evaluation of AFS Securities for OTTI and Evaluating Temporarily Impaired AFS Securities 
  As described more fully in Notes   1   and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report, the Company performs a regular evaluation of all investment classes for impairment, including fixed maturity securities, equity securities and perpetual hybrid securities, in accordance with its impairment policy, in order to evaluate whether such investments are other-than-temporarily impaired. 
  Current Period Evaluation 
  Based on the Company s current evaluation of its AFS securities in an unrealized loss position in accordance with its impairment policy, and the Company s current intentions and assessments (as applicable to the type of security) about holding, selling and any requirements to sell these securities, the Company concluded that these securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . Future OTTI will depend primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance (including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected), changes in credit ratings, collateral valuation, interest rates and credit spreads. If economic fundamentals deteriorate or if there are adverse changes in the above factors, OTTI may be incurred in upcoming periods. 
  Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities decreased   $2.1 billion   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to   $1.6 billion  . The decrease in gross unrealized losses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, narrowing credit spreads.

  6. Investments (continued)  

At   September 30, 2016  ,   $239 million   of the total   $1.6 billion   of gross unrealized losses were from   56   fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss position of   20%   or more of amortized cost for six months or greater. 
  Investment Grade Fixed Maturity Securities 
  Of the   $239 million   of gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss of   20%   or more of amortized cost for six months or greater,   $140 million  , or   59%  , were related to gross unrealized losses on   24   investment grade fixed maturity securities. Unrealized losses on investment grade fixed maturity securities are principally related to widening credit spreads and, with respect to fixed-rate fixed maturity securities, rising interest rates since purchase. 
  Below Investment Grade Fixed Maturity Securities 
  Of the   $239 million   of gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss of   20%   or more of amortized cost for six months or greater,   $99 million  , or   41%  , were related to gross unrealized losses on   32   below investment grade fixed maturity securities. Unrealized losses on below investment grade fixed maturity securities are principally related to U.S. and foreign corporate securities (primarily industrial securities) and are the result of significantly wider credit spreads resulting from higher risk premiums since purchase, largely due to economic and market uncertainties including concerns over lower oil prices in the energy sector. Management evaluates U.S. and foreign corporate securities based on factors such as expected cash flows and the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issuers. 
  Equity Securities 
  Gross unrealized losses on equity securities decreased   $91 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to   $50 million  . Of the   $50 million  ,   $32 million   were from   six   securities with gross unrealized losses of   20%   or more of cost for 12 months or greater. Of the   $32 million  ,   66%   were rated A or better, and all were from financial services industry investment grade non-redeemable preferred stock.

The cash collateral liability by loaned security type and remaining tenor of the agreements were as follows at: 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    The related loaned security could be returned to the Company on the next business day which would require the Company to immediately return the cash collateral. 
     If the Company is required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice and is forced to sell securities to meet the return obligation, it may have difficulty selling such collateral that is invested in securities in a timely manner, be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than what otherwise would have been realized under normal market conditions, or both. The estimated fair value of the securities on loan related to the cash collateral on open at   September 30, 2016   was   $4.8 billion  , all of which were U.S. government and agency securities which, if put back to the Company, could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirement.  
  The reinvestment portfolio acquired with the cash collateral consisted principally of fixed maturity securities (including U.S. government and agency, agency RMBS, ABS, short-term investments and U.S. corporate securities) with   65%   invested in U.S. government and agency securities, agency RMBS, short-term investments, or held in cash and cash equivalents. If the securities on loan or the reinvestment portfolio become less liquid, the Company has the liquidity resources of most of its general account available to meet any potential cash demands when securities on loan are put back to the Company.  
   
  Invested Assets on Deposit and Pledged as Collateral 
  Invested assets on deposit and pledged as collateral are presented below at estimated fair value for all asset classes, except mortgage loans, which are presented at carrying value at:

    The Company has pledged invested assets in connection with various agreements and transactions, including funding agreements (see Note   4   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report) and derivative transactions (see Note   7  ). 
     See    Securities Lending  for information regarding securities on loan and Note   5   for information regarding investments designated to the closed block. 
   
  Variable Interest Entities 
  The Company is involved with certain legal entities that are VIEs. In certain instances, the Company holds both the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity, as well as an economic interest in the entity and, as such, is deemed to be the primary beneficiary or consolidator of the entity. The determination of the VIE s primary beneficiary requires an evaluation of the contractual and implied rights and obligations associated with each party s relationship with or involvement in the entity.

Consolidated VIEs 
  Creditors or beneficial interest holders of VIEs where the Company is the pr  imary beneficiary have no recourse to the general credit of the Company, as the Company s obligation to the VIEs is limited to the amount of its committed investment. 
  The following table presents the total assets and total liabilities re  lating to VIEs for which the Company has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary and which are consolidated at: 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    The Company consolidates certain affiliated real estate joint ventures. At     September 30, 2016  , the Company and its affiliates invested     $428 million     and     $64 million  , respectively, in these affiliated real estate joint ventures. 
              (2) 
    The Company consolidated certain fixed maturity securities purchased in an investment structure which was partially funded with affiliated long-term debt. These investments were sold in June 2016. The long-term debt bore interest primarily at variable rates, payable on a bi-annual basis. 
              (3) 
    Other investments is primarily comprised of other invested assets and other limited partnership interests. The Company consolidates entities that are structured as collateralized debt obligations. The assets of these entities can only be used to settle their respective liabilities, and under no circumstances is the Company liable for any principal or interest shortfalls should any arise. The Company s exposure was limited to that of its remaining investment in these entities of less than   $1 million   at estimated fair value at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
     Unconsolidated VIEs 
  The carrying amount and maximum exposure to loss relating to VIEs in which the Company holds a significant variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary and which have not been consolidated were as follows at:

(1) 
    The maximum exposure to loss relating to fixed maturity securities AFS is equal to their carrying amounts or the carrying amounts of retained interests. The maximum exposure to loss relating to other limited partnership interests and real estate joint ventures is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded commitments. For certain of its investments in other invested assets, the Company s return is in the form of income tax credits which are guaranteed by creditworthy third parties. For such investments, the maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded commitments, reduced by income tax credits guaranteed by third parties of   $151 million   and   $179 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Such a maximum loss would be expected to occur only upon bankruptcy of the issuer or investee. 
              (2) 
    For these variable interests, the Company s involvement is limited to that of a passive investor in mortgage-backed or asset backed securities issued by trusts that do not have substantial equity. 
     As described in Note   12  , the Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in the normal course of business. Excluding these commitments, the Company did not provide financial or other support to investees designated as VIEs during both the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
  Net Investment Income 
  The components of net investment income were as follows:

  The table below presents a rollforward of the cumulative credit loss component of OTTI loss recognized in earnings on fixed maturity securities still held for which a portion of the OTTI loss was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ): 

Related Party Investment Transactions 
  The Company transfers invested assets, primarily consisting of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans to and from affiliates. Invested assets transferred to and from affiliates were as follows: 

In April 2016, the Company transferred investments and cash and cash equivalents with an amortized cost and fair value of   $4.0 billion   and   $4.3 billion  , respectively, for the recapture of risks related to certain single premium deferred annuity contracts previously reinsured to   MetLife USA  , an affiliate, which are included in the table above. See Note   13   for additional information related to the transfer.  
  Below is a summary of certain affiliated loans, which are more fully described in Note 8 of the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  The Company had affiliated loans outstanding to MetLife, Inc., which are included in other invested assets, totaling     $2.0 billion     at both     September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  . During the three months ended September 30, 2016, an affiliated loan for     $250 million     matured and, subsequently, a new loan was issued for     $250 million  , which bears interest, payable semiannually, at a fixed rate of     3.03%  , and matures on     September 30, 2020  . Net investment income from affiliated loans was     $23 million     and     $70 million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and     $24 million     and     $72 million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.    
  As a structured settlements assignment company, the Company purchases annuities from affiliates to fund the periodic structured settlement claim payment obligations it assumes. Each annuity purchased is contractually designated to the assumed claim obligation it funds. The aggregate annuity contract values recorded, for which the Company has also recorded an unpaid claim obligation of equal amounts, were     $1.3 billion     at both     September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  . The related net investment income and corresponding policyholder benefits and claims recognized were     $17 million     and     $46 million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and     $17 million     and     $48 million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.    
  The Company holds a surplus note from American Life Insurance Company, an affiliate, which is included in other invested assets, totaling     $100 million     at both     September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  . Net investment income from this surplus note was     $1 million     and     $3 million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and     $1 million     and     $3 million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.    
  The Company provides investment administrative services to certain affiliates. The related investment administrative service charges to these affiliates were   $42 million   and   $127 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $40 million   and   $119 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The Company also earned additional affiliated net investment income of   $2 million   and   $4 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $1 million   and   $3 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.

7. Derivatives 
   
  Accounting for Derivatives 
  Freestanding Derivatives 
  Freestanding derivatives are carried on the Company s balance sheet either as assets within other invested assets or as liabilities within other liabilities at estimated fair value. The Company does not offset the estimated fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement. 
  Accruals on derivatives are generally recorded in accrued investment income or within other liabilities. However, accruals that are not scheduled to settle within one year are included with the derivatives carrying value in other invested assets or other liabilities. 
  If a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge or its use in managing risk does not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative are reported in net derivative gains (losses) except as follows: 
                   Statement of Operations Presentation: 
    Derivative: 
      Policyholder benefits and claims 
       
    Economic hedges of variable annuity guarantees included in 
  future policy benefits 
      Net investment income 
       
    Economic hedges of equity method investments in joint 
  ventures 

All derivatives held in relation to trading portfolios 

Hedge Accounting 
  To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge. Hedge designation and financial statement presentation of changes in estimated fair value of the hedging derivatives are as follows: 
             
    Fair value hedge (a hedge of the estimated fair value of a recognized asset or liability) - in net derivative gains (losses), consistent with the change in estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the designated risk being hedged. 
                
    Cash flow hedge (a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability) - effectiveness in OCI (deferred gains or losses on the derivative are reclassified into the statement of operations when the Company s earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged item); ineffectiveness in net derivative gains (losses). 
     The changes in estimated fair values of the hedging derivatives are exclusive of any accruals that are separately reported on the statement of operations within interest income or interest expense to match the location of the hedged item. 
  In its hedge documentation, the Company sets forth how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the designated risks related to the hedged item and sets forth the method that will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedging instrument s effectiveness and the method that will be used to measure ineffectiveness. A derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risk of the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and at least quarterly throughout the life of the designated hedging relationship. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness are also subject to interpretation and estimation and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income. 
  The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (i) it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated fair value or cash flows of a hedged item; (ii) the derivative expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised; (iii) it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur; or (iv) the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument.

  (A Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of MetLife, Inc.) 
  Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)   (continued) 
  7. Derivatives (continued)  

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative is not highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in net derivative gains (losses). The carrying value of the hedged recognized asset or liability under a fair value hedge is no longer adjusted for changes in its estimated fair value due to the hedged risk, and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying value is amortized into income over the remaining life of the hedged item. Provided the hedged forecasted transaction is still probable of occurrence, the changes in estimated fair value of derivatives recorded in OCI related to discontinued cash flow hedges are released into the statement of operations when the Company s earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged item. 
  When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transactions will occur on the anticipated date or within two months of that date, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized currently in net derivative gains (losses). Deferred gains and losses of a derivative recorded in OCI pursuant to the discontinued cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction that is no longer probable are recognized immediately in net derivative gains (losses). 
  In all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative is carried at its estimated fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in its estimated fair value recognized in the current period as net derivative gains (losses). 
  Embedded Derivatives 
  The Company sells variable annuities and issues certain insurance products and investment contracts and is a party to certain reinsurance agreements that have embedded derivatives. The Company assesses each identified embedded derivative to determine whether it is required to be bifurcated. The embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for as a freestanding derivative if: 
             
    the combined instrument is not accounted for in its entirety at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value recorded in earnings; 
                
    the terms of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract; and 
                
    a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument. 
     Such embedded derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at estimated fair value with the host contract and changes in their estimated fair value are generally reported in net derivative gains (losses). If the Company is unable to properly identify and measure an embedded derivative for separation from its host contract, the entire contract is carried on the balance sheet at estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in the current period in net investment gains (losses) or net investment income. Additionally, the Company may elect to carry an entire contract on the balance sheet at estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in the current period in net investment gains (losses) or net investment income if that contract contains an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation. At inception, the Company attributes to the embedded derivative a portion of the projected future guarantee fees to be collected from the policyholder equal to the present value of projected future guaranteed benefits. Any additional fees represent  excess  fees and are reported in universal life and investment-type product policy fees. 
  See Note   8   for information about the fair value hierarchy for derivatives. 
   
  Derivative Strategies 
  The Company is exposed to various risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. The Company uses a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives. 
  Derivatives are financial instruments with values derived from interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and/or other financial indices. Derivatives may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ( OTC ) market. Certain of the Company s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties ( OTC-cleared ), while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties ( OTC-bilateral ). The types of derivatives the Company uses include swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. To a lesser extent, the Company uses credit default swaps and structured interest rate swaps to synthetically replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily available in the cash market.

  7. Derivatives (continued)  

Interest Rate Derivatives 
  The Company uses a variety of interest rate derivatives to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps, interest rate total return swaps, caps, floors, swaptions, futures and forwards. 
  Interest rate swaps are used by the Company primarily to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (duration mismatches). In an interest rate swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts as calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. The Company utilizes interest rate swaps in fair value, cash flow and nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  The Company uses structured interest rate swaps to synthetically create investments that are either more expensive to acquire or otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions are a combination of a derivative and a cash instrument such as a U.S. government and agency, or other fixed maturity security. Structured interest rate swaps are included in interest rate swaps and are not designated as hedging instruments. 
  Interest rate total return swaps are swaps whereby the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward of an asset or a market index and the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. No cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by the counterparty at each due date. Interest rate total return swaps are used by the Company to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (duration mismatches). The Company utilizes interest rate total return swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  The Company purchases interest rate caps and floors primarily to protect its floating rate liabilities against rises in interest rates above a specified level, and against interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, as well as to protect its minimum rate guarantee liabilities against declines in interest rates below a specified level, respectively. In certain instances, the Company locks in the economic impact of existing purchased caps and floors by entering into offsetting written caps and floors. The Company utilizes interest rate caps and floors in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  Swaptions are used by the Company to hedge interest rate risk associated with the Company s long-term liabilities and invested assets. A swaption is an option to enter into a swap with a forward starting effective date. In certain instances, the Company locks in the economic impact of existing purchased swaptions by entering into offsetting written swaptions. The Company pays a premium for purchased swaptions and receives a premium for written swaptions. The Company utilizes swaptions in nonqualifying hedging relationships. Swaptions are included in interest rate options. 
  The Company enters into interest rate forwards to buy and sell securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at a specified future date. The Company utilizes interest rate forwards in cash flow hedging relationships. 
  To a lesser extent, the Company uses exchange-traded interest rate futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships  . 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Derivatives 
  The Company uses foreign currency exchange rate derivatives, including foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards, to reduce the risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with its assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. 
  In a foreign currency swap transaction, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between one currency and another at a fixed exchange rate, generally set at inception, calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount. The notional amount of each currency is exchanged at the inception and termination of the currency swap by each party. The Company utilizes foreign currency swaps in fair value, cash flow and nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  In a foreign currency forward transaction, the Company agrees with another party to deliver a specified amount of an identified currency at a specified future date. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at the specified future date. The Company utilizes foreign currency forwards in nonqualifying hedging relationships.

  7. Derivatives (continued)  

Credit Derivatives 
  The Company enters into purchased credit default swaps to hedge against credit-related changes in the value of its investments. In a credit default swap transaction, the Company agrees with another party to pay, at specified intervals, a premium to hedge credit risk. If a credit event occurs, as defined by the contract, the contract may be cash settled or it may be settled gross by the delivery of par quantities of the referenced investment equal to the specified swap notional amount in exchange for the payment of cash amounts by the counterparty equal to the par value of the investment surrendered. Credit events vary by type of issuer but typically include bankruptcy, failure to pay debt obligations, repudiation, moratorium, involuntary restructuring or governmental intervention. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA ) deems that a credit event has occurred. The Company utilizes credit default swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  The Company enters into written credit default swaps to synthetically create credit investments that are either more expensive to acquire or otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions are a combination of a derivative and one or more cash instruments, such as U.S. government and agency securities, or other fixed maturity securities. These credit default swaps are not designated as hedging instruments. 
  The Company also enters into certain purchased and written credit default swaps held in relation to trading portfolios for the purpose of generating profits on short-term differences in price. These credit default swaps are not designated as hedging instruments. 
  The Company enters into forwards to lock in the price to be paid for forward purchases of certain securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for the contract is made at a specified future date. When the primary purpose of entering into these transactions is to hedge against the risk of changes in purchase price due to changes in credit spreads, the Company designates these transactions as credit forwards. The Company utilizes credit forwards in cash flow hedging relationships. 
  Equity Derivatives 
  The Company uses a variety of equity derivatives to reduce its exposure to equity market risk, including equity index options, equity variance swaps, exchange-traded equity futures and equity total return swaps. 
  Equity index options are used by the Company primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products offered by the Company. To hedge against adverse changes in equity indices, the Company enters into contracts to sell the equity index within a limited time at a contracted price. The contracts will be net settled in cash based on differentials in the indices at the time of exercise and the strike price. Certain of these contracts may also contain settlement provisions linked to interest rates. In certain instances, the Company may enter into a combination of transactions to hedge adverse changes in equity indices within a pre-determined range through the purchase and sale of options. The Company utilizes equity index options in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  Equity variance swaps are used by the Company primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products offered by the Company. In an equity variance swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange amounts in the future, based on changes in equity volatility over a defined period. The Company utilizes equity variance swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  In exchange-traded equity futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the value of which is determined by the different classes of equity securities, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange. Exchange-traded equity futures are used primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products offered by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded equity futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  In an equity total return swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward of an asset or a market index and LIBOR, calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. No cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. The Company uses equity total return swaps to hedge its equity market guarantees in certain of its insurance products. Equity total return swaps can be used as hedges or to synthetically create investments. The Company utilizes equity total return swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.

Primary Risks Managed by Derivatives 
  The following table presents the gross notional amount, estimated fair value and primary underlying risk exposure of the Company s derivatives, excluding embedded derivatives, held at: 

Based on gross notional amounts, a substantial portion of the Company s derivatives was not designated or did not qualify as part of a hedging relationship at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Company s use of derivatives includes (i) derivatives that serve as macro hedges of the Company s exposure to various risks and that generally do not qualify for hedge accounting due to the criteria required under the portfolio hedging rules; (ii) derivatives that economically hedge insurance liabilities that contain mortality or morbidity risk and that generally do not qualify for hedge accounting because the lack of these risks in the derivatives cannot support an expectation of a highly effective hedging relationship; (iii) derivatives that economically hedge embedded derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting because the changes in estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are already recorded in net income; and (iv) written credit default swaps that are used to synthetically create credit investments and that do not qualify for hedge accounting because they do not involve a hedging relationship. For these nonqualified derivatives, changes in market factors can lead to the recognition of fair value changes on the statement of operations without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged.

In certain instances, the Company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting because the forecasted transactions were no longer probable of occurring. Because certain of the forecasted transactions also were not probable of occurring within two months of the anticipated date, the Company reclassified amounts from AOCI into net derivative gains (losses). These amounts were   $7 million   and   $10 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. For the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  , the amounts reclassified from AOCI into net derivative gains (losses) were   not significant  , and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , these amounts were   $4 million  . 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the maximum length of time over which the Company was hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions did not exceed   six years   and   five years  , respectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the balance in AOCI associated with cash flow hedges was   $2.7 billion   and   $2.2 billion  , respectively.  
  The following table presents the effects of derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and the consolidated statements of equity: 

All components of each derivative s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
  At     September 30, 2016  ,     the Company expects to reclassify   ($82) million     of deferred net gains (losses) on derivatives in AOCI to earnings within the next 12 months.

Credit Derivatives 
  In connection with synthetically created credit investment transactions and credit default swaps held in relation to the trading portfolio, the Company writes credit default swaps for which it receives a premium to insure credit risk. Such credit derivatives are included within the nonqualifying derivatives and derivatives for purposes other than hedging table. If a credit event occurs, as defined by the contract, the contract may be cash settled or it may be settled gross by the Company paying the counterparty the specified swap notional amount in exchange for the delivery of par quantities of the referenced credit obligation. The Company s maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of all referenced credit obligations is zero, was   $7.3 billion   and   $6.6 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company can terminate these contracts at any time through cash settlement with the counterparty at an amount equal to the then current estimated fair value of the credit default swaps. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company would have received   $81 million   and   $40 million  , respectively, to terminate all of these contracts. 
  The following table presents the estimated fair value, maximum amount of future payments and weighted average years to maturity of written credit default swaps at:

The Company has also entered into credit default swaps to purchase credit protection on certain of the referenced credit obligations in the table above. As a result, the maximum amounts of potential future recoveries available to offset the   $7.3 billion   and   $6.6 billion   from the table above were   $27 million   and   $70 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  At September 30, 2016, there were no written credit default swaps held in relation to the trading portfolio. At   December 31, 2015  , written credit default swaps held in relation to the trading portfolio amounted to   $20 million   in gross notional amount and   ($2) million   in estimated fair value. 
   
  Credit Risk on Freestanding Derivatives 
  The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Generally, the current credit exposure of the Company s derivatives is limited to the net positive estimated fair value of derivatives at the reporting date after taking into consideration the existence of master netting or similar agreements and any collateral received pursuant to such agreements. 
  The Company manages its credit risk related to derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties and establishing and monitoring exposure limits. The Company s OTC-bilateral derivative transactions are generally governed by ISDA Master Agreements which provide for legally enforceable set-off and close-out netting of exposures to specific counterparties in the event of early termination of a transaction, which includes, but is not limited to, events of default and bankruptcy. In the event of an early termination, the Company is permitted to set off receivables from the counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. Substantially all of the Company s ISDA Master Agreements also include Credit Support Annex provisions which require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in connection with its OTC-bilateral derivatives. 
  The Company s OTC-cleared derivatives are effected through central clearing counterparties and its exchange-traded derivatives are effected through regulated exchanges. Such positions are marked to market and margined on a daily basis (both initial margin and variation margin), and the Company has minimal exposure to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such derivatives. 
  See Note   8   for a description of the impact of credit risk on the valuation of derivatives.

The estimated fair values of the Company s net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral were as follows at: 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    At     September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  , derivative assets included income or expense accruals reported in accrued investment income or in other liabilities of     $178 million     and     $146 million  , respectively, and derivative liabilities included income or expense accruals reported in accrued investment income or in other liabilities of     ($19) million     and   $24 million  , respectively. 
              (2) 
    Estimated fair value of derivatives is limited to the amount that is subject to set-off and includes income or expense accruals. 
              (3) 
    Cash collateral received by the Company for OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives is included in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments or in fixed maturity securities, and the obligation to return it is included in payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions on the balance sheet.  
              (4) 
    The receivable for the return of cash collateral provided by the Company is inclusive of initial margin on exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives and is included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the balance sheet. The amount of cash collateral offset in the table above is limited to the net estimated fair value of derivatives after application of netting agreements. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company received excess cash collateral of   $57 million   and   $17 million  , respectively, and provided excess cash collateral of   $7 million   and   $58 million  , respectively, which is not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation.

    Securities collateral received by the Company is held in separate custodial accounts and is not recorded on the balance sheet. Subject to certain constraints, the Company is permitted by contract to sell or re-pledge this collateral, but at   September 30, 2016  ,   none   of the collateral had been sold or re-pledged. Securities collateral pledged by the Company is reported in fixed maturity securities on the balance sheet. Subject to certain constraints, the counterparties are permitted by contract to sell or re-pledge this collateral. The amount of securities collateral offset in the table above is limited to the net estimated fair value of derivatives after application of netting agreements and cash collateral. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company received excess securities collateral with an estimated fair value of   $38 million   and   $71 million  , respectively, for its OTC-bilateral derivatives, which are not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company provided excess securities collateral with an estimated fair value of   $76 million   and   $81 million  , respectively, for its OTC-bilateral derivatives, and   $404 million   and   $239 million  , respectively, for its OTC-cleared derivatives, and   $84 million   and   $15 million  , respectively, for its exchange-traded derivatives, which are not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation. 
     The Company s collateral arrangements for its OTC-bilateral derivatives generally require the party in a net liability position, after considering the effect of netting agreements, to pledge collateral when the estimated fair value of that party s derivatives reaches a minimum transfer amount. A small number of these arrangements also include financial strength or credit rating contingent provisions that include a threshold above which collateral must be posted. Such agreements provide for a reduction of these thresholds (on a sliding scale that converges toward zero) in the event of downgrades in the financial strength or credit ratings of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, or its subsidiaries, as applicable, and/or the credit ratings of the counterparty. In addition, substantially all of the Company s netting agreements for derivatives contain provisions that require both Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, or its subsidiaries, as applicable, and the counterparty to maintain a specific investment grade financial strength or credit rating from each of Moody s and S P. If a party s financial strength or credit ratings were to fall below that specific investment grade financial strength or credit rating, that party would be in violation of these provisions, and the other party to the derivatives could terminate the transactions and demand immediate settlement and payment based on such party s reasonable valuation of the derivatives. 
  The following table presents the estimated fair value of the Company s OTC-bilateral derivatives that are in a net liability position after considering the effect of netting agreements, together with the estimated fair value and balance sheet location of the collateral pledged. The table also presents the incremental collateral that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, or its subsidiaries, as applicable, would be required to provide if there was a one-notch downgrade in such companies  financial strength or credit rating, as applicable, at the reporting date or if such companies  financial strength or credit rating, as applicable, sustained a downgrade to a level that triggered full overnight collateralization or termination of the derivative position at the reporting date. OTC-bilateral derivatives that are not subject to collateral agreements are excluded from this table.

    The valuation of direct and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits includes a nonperformance risk adjustment. The amounts included in net derivative gains (losses) in connection with this adjustment were     ($47) million     and     $173 million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and     $37 million     and     $33 million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. In addition, the valuation of ceded guaranteed minimum benefits includes a nonperformance risk adjustment. The amounts included in net derivative gains (losses) in connection with this adjustment were     $9 million     and     ($64) million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and     ($11) million     and     ($8) million     for the     three months     and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.

  Valuation Controls and Procedures 
  On behalf of the Company and MetLife, Inc. s Chief Investment Officer and Chief Financial Officer, a pricing and valuation committee that is independent of the trading and investing functions and comprised of senior management, provides oversight of control systems and valuation policies for securities, mortgage loans and derivatives. On a quarterly basis, this committee reviews and approves new transaction types and markets, ensures that observable market prices and market-based parameters are used for valuation, wherever possible, and determines that judgmental valuation adjustments, when applied, are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time. This committee also provides oversight of the selection of independent third-party pricing providers and the controls and procedures to evaluate third-party pricing. Periodically, the Chief Accounting Officer reports to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of each of MetLife, Inc. and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company regarding compliance with fair value accounting standards. 
  The Company reviews its valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and revises those methodologies when necessary based on changing market conditions. Assurance is gained on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of input assumptions, valuation methodologies and compliance with fair value accounting standards through controls designed to ensure valuations represent an exit price. Several controls are utilized, including certain monthly controls, which include, but are not limited to, analysis of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns, comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates, comparing fair value estimates to management s knowledge of the current market, reviewing the bid/ask spreads to assess activity, comparing prices from multiple independent pricing services and ongoing due diligence to confirm that independent pricing services use market-based parameters. The process includes a determination of the observability of inputs used in estimated fair values received from independent pricing services or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data. The Company ensures that prices received from independent brokers, also referred to herein as  consensus pricing,  represent a reasonable estimate of fair value by considering such pricing relative to the Company s knowledge of the current market dynamics and current pricing for similar financial instruments. While independent non-binding broker quotations are utilized, they are not used for a significant portion of the portfolio. For example, fixed maturity securities priced using independent non-binding broker quotations represent less than   1%   of the total estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities and   3%   of the total estimated fair value of Level 3 fixed maturity securities at   September 30, 2016  .

The Company also applies a formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value. If prices received from independent pricing services are not considered reflective of market activity or representative of estimated fair value, independent non-binding broker quotations are obtained, or an internally developed valuation is prepared. Internally developed valuations of current estimated fair value, which reflect internal estimates of liquidity and nonperformance risks, compared with pricing received from the independent pricing services, did not produce material differences in the estimated fair values for the majority of the portfolio; accordingly, overrides were not material. This is, in part, because internal estimates of liquidity and nonperformance risks are generally based on available market evidence and estimates used by other market participants. In the absence of such market-based evidence, management s best estimate is used. 
  Securities, Short-term Investments, Long-term Debt, Long-term Debt of CSEs   FVO and Trading Liabilities 
  When available, the estimated fair value of these financial instruments is based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. Generally, these are the most liquid of the Company s securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not involve management s judgment. 
  When quoted prices in active markets are not available, the determination of estimated fair value is based on market standard valuation methodologies, giving priority to observable inputs. The significant inputs to the market standard valuation methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. When observable inputs are not available, the market standard valuation methodologies rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. These unobservable inputs can be based in large part on management s judgment or estimation and cannot be supported by reference to market activity. Even though these inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such securities and are considered appropriate given the circumstances. 
  The estimated fair value of FVO securities held by CSEs, long-term debt, long-term debt of CSEs   FVO and trading liabilities is determined on a basis consistent with the methodologies described herein for securities.  
  The valuation of most instruments listed below is determined using independent pricing sources, matrix pricing, discounted cash flow methodologies or other similar techniques that use either observable market inputs or unobservable inputs.

__________________ 
           (1) 
    Estimated fair value equals carrying value, based on the value of the underlying assets, including: mutual fund interests, fixed maturity securities, equity securities, derivatives, hedge funds, other limited partnership interests, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents. Fixed maturity securities, equity securities, derivatives, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents are similar in nature to the instruments described under    Securities, Short-term Investments, Long-term Debt, Long-term Debt of CSEs   FVO and Trading Liabilities  and    Derivatives   Freestanding Derivatives.  
      
  Derivatives 
  The estimated fair value of derivatives is determined through the use of quoted market prices for exchange-traded derivatives, or through the use of pricing models for OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives. The determination of estimated fair value, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. The valuation controls and procedures for derivatives are described in    Investments.  
  The significant inputs to the pricing models for most OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Certain OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives may rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. These unobservable inputs may involve significant management judgment or estimation. Even though unobservable, these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments.

  8. Fair Value (continued) 

Most inputs for OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives are mid-market inputs but, in certain cases, liquidity adjustments are made when they are deemed more representative of exit value. Market liquidity, as well as the use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs, may have a material effect on the estimated fair values of the Company s derivatives and could materially affect net income. 
  The credit risk of both the counterparty and the Company are considered in determining the estimated fair value for all OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives, and any potential credit adjustment is based on the net exposure by counterparty after taking into account the effects of netting agreements and collateral arrangements. The Company values its OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives using standard swap curves which may include a spread to the risk-free rate, depending upon specific collateral arrangements. This credit spread is appropriate for those parties that execute trades at pricing levels consistent with similar collateral arrangements. As the Company and its significant derivative counterparties generally execute trades at such pricing levels and hold sufficient collateral, additional credit risk adjustments are not currently required in the valuation process. The Company s ability to consistently execute at such pricing levels is in part due to the netting agreements and collateral arrangements that are in place with all of its significant derivative counterparties. An evaluation of the requirement to make additional credit risk adjustments is performed by the Company each reporting period  . 
  Freestanding Derivatives 
  Level 2 Valuation Techniques and Key Inputs: 
  This level includes all types of derivatives utilized by the Company with the exception of exchange-traded derivatives included within Level 1 and those derivatives with unobservable inputs as described in Level 3. 
  Level 3 Valuation Techniques and Key Inputs: 
  These valuation methodologies generally use the same inputs as described in the corresponding sections for Level 2 measurements of derivatives. However, these derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 
  Freestanding derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. Valuations of non-option-based derivatives utilize present value techniques, whereas valuations of option-based derivatives utilize option pricing models. Key inputs are as follows: 
                               Instrument

Embedded Derivatives 
  Embedded derivatives principally include certain direct, assumed and ceded variable annuity guarantees, certain affiliated ceded reinsurance agreements related to such variable annuity guarantees, equity or bond indexed crediting rates within certain funding agreements and those related to funds withheld on ceded reinsurance agreements. Embedded derivatives are recorded at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value reported in net income. 
  The Company issues certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits. GMWBs, GMABs and certain GMIBs contain embedded derivatives, which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). These embedded derivatives are classified within policyholder account balances on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  The Company s actuarial department calculates the fair value of these embedded derivatives, which are estimated as the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees using actuarial and capital market assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. The calculation is based on in-force business, and is performed using standard actuarial valuation software which projects future cash flows from the embedded derivative over multiple risk neutral stochastic scenarios using observable risk-free rates. 
  Capital market assumptions, such as risk-free rates and implied volatilities, are based on market prices for publicly traded instruments to the extent that prices for such instruments are observable. Implied volatilities beyond the observable period are extrapolated based on observable implied volatilities and historical volatilities. Actuarial assumptions, including mortality, lapse, withdrawal and utilization, are unobservable and are reviewed at least annually based on actuarial studies of historical experience. 
  The valuation of these guarantee liabilities includes nonperformance risk adjustments and adjustments for a risk margin related to non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance adjustment is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc. s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. 
  Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions as annuitization, premium persistency, partial withdrawal and surrenders. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees. These guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in nonperformance risk; and variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. 
  The Company ceded the risk associated with certain of the GMIBs, GMABs and GMWBs previously described. In addition to ceding risks associated with guarantees that are accounted for as embedded derivatives, the Company also ceded directly written GMIBs that are accounted for as insurance (i.e., not as embedded derivatives) but where the reinsurance agreement contains an embedded derivative. These embedded derivatives are included within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by the Company with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. 
  The estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance is determined based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying assets held by the Company in a reference portfolio backing the funds withheld liability. The estimated fair value of the underlying assets is determined as previously described in    Investments   Securities, Short-term Investments, Long-term Debt, Long-term Debt of CSEs   FVO and Trading Liabilities.  The estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives is included, along with their funds withheld hosts, in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). Changes in the credit spreads on the underlying assets, interest rates and market volatility may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives that could materially affect net income.

  8. Fair Value (continued) 

The estimated fair value of the embedded equity and bond indexed derivatives contained in certain funding agreements is determined using market standard swap valuation models and observable market inputs, including a nonperformance risk adjustment. The estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives are included, along with their funding agreements host, within policyholder account balances with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). Changes in equity and bond indices, interest rates and the Company s credit standing may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives that could materially affect net income. 
  Embedded Derivatives Within Asset and Liability Host Contracts 
  Level 3 Valuation Techniques and Key Inputs: 
  Direct and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits 
  These embedded derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. Valuations are based on option pricing techniques, which utilize significant inputs that may include swap yield curves, currency exchange rates and implied volatilities. These embedded derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Significant unobservable inputs generally include: the extrapolation beyond observable limits of the swap yield curves and implied volatilities, actuarial assumptions for policyholder behavior and mortality and the potential variability in policyholder behavior and mortality, nonperformance risk and cost of capital for purposes of calculating the risk margin. 
  Reinsurance ceded on certain guaranteed minimum benefits 
  These embedded derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. The valuation techniques and significant market standard unobservable inputs used in their valuation are similar to those described above in    Direct and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits  and also include counterparty credit spreads. 
  Embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance 
  These embedded derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. The valuations are based on present value techniques, which utilize significant inputs that may include the swap yield curves and the fair value of assets within the reference portfolio. These embedded derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Significant unobservable inputs generally include the fair value of certain assets within the reference portfolio which are not observable in the market and cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 
   
  Transfers between Levels 
  Overall, transfers between levels occur when there are changes in the observability of inputs and market activity. Transfers into or out of any level are assumed to occur at the beginning of the period. 
  Transfers between Levels 1 and 2: 
  For assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value and still held at   September 30, 2016  , there were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2. For assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value and still held at   December 31, 2015  , transfers between Levels 1 and 2 were not significant. 
  Transfers into or out of Level 3: 
  Assets and liabilities are transferred into Level 3 when a significant input cannot be corroborated with market observable data. This occurs when market activity decreases significantly and underlying inputs cannot be observed, current prices are not available, and/or when there are significant variances in quoted prices, thereby affecting transparency. Assets and liabilities are transferred out of Level 3 when circumstances change such that a significant input can be corroborated with market observable data. This may be due to a significant increase in market activity, a specific event, or one or more significant input(s) becoming observable.

              (2) 
    The impact of a decrease in input would have the opposite impact on estimated fair value. For embedded derivatives, changes to direct and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits are based on liability positions; changes to ceded guaranteed minimum benefits are based on asset positions.

(6) 
    Changes in the assumptions used for the probability of default is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumptions used for prepayment rates. 
              (7) 
    Ranges represent the rates across different yield curves and are presented in basis points. The swap yield curves are utilized among different types of derivatives to project cash flows, as well as to discount future cash flows to present value. Since this valuation methodology uses a range of inputs across a yield curve to value the derivative, presenting a range is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation. 
              (8) 
    Changes in estimated fair value are based on long U.S. dollar net asset positions and will be inversely impacted for short U.S. dollar net asset positions. 
              (9) 
    Ranges represent different repurchase rates utilized as components within the valuation methodology and are presented in basis points. 
              (10) 
    Represents the risk quoted in basis points of a credit default event on the underlying instrument. Credit derivatives with significant unobservable inputs are primarily comprised of written credit default swaps. 
              (11) 
    At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , independent non-binding broker quotations were used in the determination of less than 1% of the total net derivative estimated fair value. 
              (12) 
    Ranges represent the underlying equity volatility quoted in percentage points. Since this valuation methodology uses a range of inputs across multiple volatility surfaces to value the derivative, presenting a range is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation. 
              (13) 
    Ranges represent the different correlation factors utilized as components within the valuation methodology. Presenting a range of correlation factors is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation. Increases (decreases) in correlation in isolation will increase (decrease) the significance of the change in valuations. 
              (14) 
    Mortality rates vary by age and by demographic characteristics such as gender. Mortality rate assumptions are based on company experience. A mortality improvement assumption is also applied. For any given contract, mortality rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. 
              (15) 
    Base lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on a comparison of the actuarially calculated guaranteed values and the current policyholder account value, as well as other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. A dynamic lapse function reduces the base lapse rate when the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value as in the money contracts are less likely to lapse. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower in periods when a surrender charge applies. For any given contract, lapse rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. 
              (16) 
    The utilization rate assumption estimates the percentage of contract holders with a GMIB or lifetime withdrawal benefit who will elect to utilize the benefit upon becoming eligible. The rates may vary by the type of guarantee, the amount by which the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value, the contract s withdrawal history and by the age of the policyholder. For any given contract, utilization rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. 
              (17) 
    The withdrawal rate represents the percentage of account balance that any given policyholder will elect to withdraw from the contract each year. The withdrawal rate assumption varies by age and duration of the contract, and also by other factors such as benefit type. For any given contract, withdrawal rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. For GMWBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees. For GMABs and GMIBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value. 
              (18) 
    Long-term equity volatilities represent equity volatility beyond the period for which observable equity volatilities are available. For any given contract, long-term equity volatility rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. 
              (19) 
    Nonperformance risk spread varies by duration and by currency. For any given contract, multiple nonperformance risk spreads will apply, depending on the duration of the cash flow being discounted for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative.

Generally, all other classes of securities classified within Level 3, including those within separate account assets and embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance, use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3 securities. This includes matrix pricing and discounted cash flow methodologies, inputs such as quoted prices for identical or similar securities that are less liquid and based on lower levels of trading activity than securities classified in Level 2, as well as independent non-binding broker quotations. The residential mortgage loans   FVO, long-term debt and long-term debt of CSEs   FVO are valued using independent non-binding broker quotations and internal models including matrix pricing and discounted cash flow methodologies using current interest rates. The sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in the significant unobservable inputs for these other assets and liabilities is similar in nature to that described in the preceding table. The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement for the more significant assets measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis and determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are summarized in    Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The following table presents information for assets measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the periods and still held at the reporting dates (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). The estimated fair values for these assets were determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    Estimated fair values for impaired mortgage loans are based on independent broker quotations or valuation models using unobservable inputs or, if the loans are in foreclosure or are otherwise determined to be collateral dependent, are based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows. 
              (2) 
    For these cost method investments, estimated fair value is determined from information provided on the financial statements of the underlying entities including net asset value ( NAV ) data. These investments include private equity and debt funds that typically invest primarily in various strategies including domestic and international leveraged buyout funds; power, energy, timber and infrastructure development funds; venture capital funds; and below investment grade debt and mezzanine debt funds. Distributions will be generated from investment gains, from operating income from the underlying investments of the funds and from liquidation of the underlying assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated over the next   two   to   10 years  . Unfunded commitments for these investments at both   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were not significant. 
              (3) 
    During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized an impairment of computer software in connection with the   sale to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company ( MassMutual ) of MetLife, Inc. s U.S. retail advisor force and certain assets associated with the MetLife Premier Client Group, including all of the issued and outstanding shares of MetLife s affiliated broker-dealer, MetLife Securities, Inc. ( MSI ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. See Note   13  . 
      
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carried at Other Than Fair Value 
  The following tables provide fair value information for financial instruments that are carried on the balance sheet at amounts other than fair value. These tables exclude the following financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income, payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions, short-term debt and those short-term investments that are not securities, such as time deposits, and therefore are not included in the three level hierarchy table disclosed in the    Recurring Fair Value Measurements  section. The estimated fair value of the excluded financial instruments, which are primarily classified in Level 2, approximates carrying value as they are short-term in nature such that the Company believes there is minimal risk of material changes in interest rates or credit quality. All remaining balance sheet amounts excluded from the tables below are not considered financial instruments subject to this disclosure.

The carrying values and estimated fair values for such financial instruments, and their corresponding placement in the fair value hierarchy, are summarized as follows at: 

The methods, assumptions and significant valuation techniques and inputs used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are summarized as follows: 
  Mortgage Loans 
  The estimated fair value of mortgage loans is primarily determined by estimating expected future cash flows and discounting them using current interest rates for similar mortgage loans with similar credit risk, or is determined from pricing for similar loans.

  Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)   (continued) 
  8. Fair Value (continued) 

Policy Loans 
  Policy loans with fixed interest rates are classified within Level 3. The estimated fair values for these loans are determined using a discounted cash flow model applied to groups of similar policy loans determined by the nature of the underlying insurance liabilities. Cash flow estimates are developed by applying a weighted-average interest rate to the outstanding principal balance of the respective group of policy loans and an estimated average maturity determined through experience studies of the past performance of policyholder repayment behavior for similar loans. These cash flows are discounted using current risk-free interest rates with no adjustment for borrower credit risk, as these loans are fully collateralized by the cash surrender value of the underlying insurance policy. Policy loans with variable interest rates are classified within Level 2 and the estimated fair value approximates carrying value due to the absence of borrower credit risk and the short time period between interest rate resets, which presents minimal risk of a material change in estimated fair value due to changes in market interest rates. 
  Real Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership Interests 
  The estimated fair values of these cost method investments are generally based on the Company s share of the NAV as provided on the financial statements of the investees. In certain circumstances, management may adjust the NAV by a premium or discount when it has sufficient evidence to support applying such adjustments. 
  Other Invested Assets 
  These other invested assets are principally comprised of loans to affiliates. The estimated fair value of loans to affiliates is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using market interest rates currently available for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities. 
  Premiums, Reinsurance and Other Receivables 
  Premiums, reinsurance and other receivables are principally comprised of certain amounts recoverable under reinsurance agreements, amounts on deposit with financial institutions to facilitate daily settlements related to certain derivatives and amounts receivable for securities sold but not yet settled.  
  Amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance agreements, which the Company has determined do not transfer significant risk such that they are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting, have been classified as Level 3. The valuation is based on discounted cash flow methodologies using significant unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value is determined using interest rates determined to reflect the appropriate credit standing of the assuming counterparty. 
  The amounts on deposit for derivative settlements, classified within Level 2, essentially represent the equivalent of demand deposit balances and amounts due for securities sold are generally received over short periods such that the estimated fair value approximates carrying value. 
  Policyholder Account Balances 
  These policyholder account balances include investment contracts which primarily include certain funding agreements, fixed deferred annuities, modified guaranteed annuities, fixed term payout annuities and total control accounts ( TCA ). The valuation of these investment contracts is based on discounted cash flow methodologies using significant unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value is determined using current market risk-free interest rates adding a spread to reflect the nonperformance risk in the liability. 
  Long-term Debt 
  The estimated fair value of long-term debt is principally determined using market standard valuation methodologies. 
  Valuations of instruments are based primarily on quoted prices in markets that are not active or using matrix pricing that use standard market observable inputs such as quoted prices in markets that are not active and observable yields and spreads in the market. Instruments valued using discounted cash flow methodologies use standard market observable inputs including market yield curve, duration, call provisions, observable prices and spreads for similar publicly traded or privately traded issues.

Other Liabilities 
  Other liabilities consist primarily of interest payable, amounts due for securities purchased but not yet settled, funds withheld amounts payable, which are contractually withheld by the Company in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreements, and amounts payable under certain assumed reinsurance agreements, which are recorded using the deposit method of accounting. The Company evaluates the specific terms, facts and circumstances of each instrument to determine the appropriate estimated fair values, which are not materially different from the carrying values, with the exception of certain deposit type reinsurance payables. For such payables, the estimated fair value is determined as the present value of expected future cash flows, which are discounted using an interest rate determined to reflect the appropriate credit standing of the assuming counterparty. 
  Separate Account Liabilities 
  Separate account liabilities represent those balances due to policyholders under contracts that are classified as investment contracts. 
  Separate account liabilities classified as investment contracts primarily represent variable annuities with no significant mortality risk to the Company such that the death benefit is equal to the account balance, funding agreements related to group life contracts and certain contracts that provide for benefit funding. 
  Since separate account liabilities are fully funded by cash flows from the separate account assets which are recognized at estimated fair value as described in the section    Recurring Fair Value Measurements,  the value of those assets approximates the estimated fair value of the related separate account liabilities. The valuation techniques and inputs for separate account liabilities are similar to those described for separate account assets.

  Contingencies 
  Litigation 
  The Company is a defendant in a large number of litigation matters. In some of the matters, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Modern pleading practice in the U.S. permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with the actual experience of the Company in litigating or resolving through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of time, demonstrates to management that the monetary relief which may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to its merits or disposition value. 
  Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may normally be difficult to ascertain. Uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal. Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law. 
  The Company establishes liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been established for a number of the matters noted below. It is possible that some of the matters could require the Company to pay damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated at   September 30, 2016  . While the potential future charges could be material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on information currently known to management, management does not believe any such charges are likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial position. 
  Matters as to Which an Estimate Can Be Made 
  For some of the matters disclosed below, the Company is able to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss. For such matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, no accrual has been made. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued for these matters to be   $0   to   $400 million  . 
  Matters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made 
  For other matters disclosed below, the Company is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company is often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by the court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts, and the progress of settlement negotiations. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to litigation contingencies and updates its accruals, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews.

Asbestos-Related Claims 
  Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is and has been a defendant in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and seek both actual and punitive damages. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has never engaged in the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products nor has Metropolitan Life Insurance Company issued liability or workers  compensation insurance to companies in the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products. The lawsuits principally have focused on allegations with respect to certain research, publication and other activities of one or more of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s employees during the period from the 1920 s through approximately the 1950 s and allege that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company learned or should have learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health risks. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company believes that it should not have legal liability in these cases. The outcome of most asbestos litigation matters, however, is uncertain and can be impacted by numerous variables, including differences in legal rulings in various jurisdictions, the nature of the alleged injury and factors unrelated to the ultimate legal merit of the claims asserted against Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company employs a number of resolution strategies to manage its asbestos loss exposure, including seeking resolution of pending litigation by judicial rulings and settling individual or groups of claims or lawsuits under appropriate circumstances. 
  Claims asserted against Metropolitan Life Insurance Company have included negligence, intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the health risks associated with asbestos. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s defenses (beyond denial of certain factual allegations) include that: (i) Metropolitan Life Insurance Company owed no duty to the plaintiffs   it had no special relationship with the plaintiffs and did not manufacture, produce, distribute or sell the asbestos products that allegedly injured plaintiffs; (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any actions of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company; (iii) Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s conduct was not the cause of the plaintiffs  injuries; (iv) plaintiffs  exposure occurred after the dangers of asbestos were known; and (v) the applicable time with respect to filing suit has expired. During the course of the litigation, certain trial courts have granted motions dismissing claims against Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, while other trial courts have denied Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s motions. There can be no assurance that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company will receive favorable decisions on motions in the future. While most cases brought to date have settled, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company intends to continue to defend aggressively against claims based on asbestos exposure, including defending claims at trials. 
  As reported in the   2015   Annual Report, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company received approximately   3,856   asbestos-related claims in   2015  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Metropolitan Life Insurance Company received approximately   3,267   and   2,971   new asbestos-related claims, respectively. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report for historical information concerning asbestos claims and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s increase in its recorded liability at December 31,   2014  . The number of asbestos cases that may be brought, the aggregate amount of any liability that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company may incur, and the total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain and may vary significantly from year to year.  
  The ability of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure is subject to considerable uncertainty, and the conditions impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to change. The availability of reliable data is limited and it is difficult to predict the numerous variables that can affect liability estimates, including the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against Metropolitan Life Insurance Company when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts. 
  The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years further in the future. In the Company s judgment, there is a future point after which losses cease to be probable and reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that the Company s total exposure to asbestos claims may be materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued and that future charges to income may be necessary. While the potential future charges could be material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on information currently known by management, management does not believe any such charges are likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial position.

  12. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees (continued)  

The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related claims. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s recorded asbestos liability is based on its estimation of the following elements, as informed by the facts presently known to it, its understanding of current law and its past experiences: (i) the probable and reasonably estimable liability for asbestos claims already asserted against Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, including claims settled but not yet paid; (ii) the probable and reasonably estimable liability for asbestos claims not yet asserted against Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, but which Metropolitan Life Insurance Company believes are reasonably probable of assertion; and (iii) the legal defense costs associated with the foregoing claims. Significant assumptions underlying Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s analysis of the adequacy of its recorded liability with respect to asbestos litigation include: (i) the number of future claims; (ii) the cost to resolve claims; and (iii) the cost to defend claims. 
  Metropolitan Life Insurance Company reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure from asbestos litigation, including studying its claims experience, reviewing external literature regarding asbestos claims experience in the United States, assessing relevant trends impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous variables that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an overall or per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies of other companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative and judicial developments, the number of pending claims involving serious disease, the number of new claims filed against it and other defendants and the jurisdictions in which claims are pending. Based upon its regular reevaluation of its exposure from asbestos litigation, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has updated its liability analysis for asbestos-related claims through   September 30, 2016  . 
  Regulatory Matters 
  The Company receives and responds to subpoenas or other inquiries seeking a broad range of information from state regulators, including state insurance commissioners; state attorneys general or other state governmental authorities; federal regulators, including the SEC; federal governmental authorities, including congressional committees; and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ). The issues involved in information requests and regulatory matters vary widely. The Company cooperates in these inquiries. 
  In the Matter of Chemform, Inc. Site, Pompano Beach, Broward County, Florida 
  In July 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) advised Metropolitan Life Insurance Company that it believed payments were due under   two   settlement agreements, known as  Administrative Orders on Consent,  that New England Mutual Life Insurance Company signed in 1989 and 1992 with respect to the cleanup of a Superfund site in Florida (the  Chemform Site ). The EPA is requesting payment of an amount under   $1 million   from Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and such third party for past costs and an additional amount for future environmental testing costs at the Chemform Site. In September 2012, the EPA, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and the third party executed an Administrative Order on Consent under which Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and the third party have agreed to be responsible for certain environmental testing at the Chemform Site. The Company estimates that its costs for the environmental testing will not exceed   $100,000  . The September 2012 Administrative Order on Consent does not resolve the EPA s claim for past clean-up costs. The EPA may seek additional costs if the environmental testing identifies issues. The Company estimates that the aggregate cost to resolve this matter will not exceed   $1 million  . 
  Sales Practices Regulatory Matters 
  Regulatory authorities in a number of states and FINRA, and occasionally the SEC, have had investigations or inquiries relating to sales of individual life insurance policies or annuities or other products by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, NELICO and General American Life Insurance Company ( GALIC ). These investigations often focus on the conduct of particular financial services representatives and the sale of unregistered or unsuitable products or the misuse of client assets. Over the past several years, these and a number of investigations by other regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments and certain other relief, including restitution payments. The Company may continue to resolve investigations in a similar manner. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for these sales practices-related investigations or inquiries.

Unclaimed Property Litigation 
  West Virginia Lawsuits 
  On September 20, 2012, the West Virginia Treasurer filed an action against Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in West Virginia state court   (West Virginia ex rel. John D. Perdue v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, Circuit Court of Putnam County, Civil Action No. 12-C-295)     alleging that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company violated the West Virginia Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (the  Act ), seeking to compel compliance with the Act, and seeking payment of unclaimed property, interest, and penalties. On November 21, 2012 and January 9, 2013, the Treasurer filed substantially identical suits against NELICO and GALIC, respectively. On August 17, 2016, these companies and the West Virginia Treasurer reached an agreement in principle to resolve these actions. 
  Total Control Accounts Litigation 
  Owens v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (N.D. Ga., filed April 17, 2014) 
  Plaintiff filed this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of all persons for whom Metropolitan Life Insurance Company established a retained asset account, known as a TCA, to pay death benefits under an Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ) plan. The action alleges that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s use of the TCA as the settlement option for life insurance benefits under some group life insurance policies violates Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s fiduciary duties under ERISA. As damages, plaintiff seeks disgorgement of profits that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company realized on accounts owned by members of the putative class. On September 27, 2016, the court denied Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s summary judgment motion in full and granted plaintiff s partial summary judgment motion. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously. 
  Reinsurance Litigation 
  Robainas, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (S.D.N.Y., December 16, 2014) 
  Plaintiffs filed this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all persons and entities who, directly or indirectly, purchased, renewed or paid premiums on life insurance policies issued by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company from 2009 through 2014 (the  Policies ). Two similar actions were subsequently filed,     Yale v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (S.D.N.Y., January 12, 2015) and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge 15 v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (E.D.N.Y., February 2, 2015)  . Both of these actions were consolidated with the Robainas action. The consolidated complaint alleges that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company inadequately disclosed in its statutory annual statements that certain reinsurance transactions with affiliated reinsurance companies were collateralized using  contractual parental guarantees,  and thereby allegedly misrepresented its financial condition and the adequacy of its reserves. The lawsuit sought recovery under Section 4226 of the New York Insurance Law of a statutory penalty in the amount of the premiums paid for the Policies. On October 9, 2015, the court granted Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, finding that plaintiffs lacked Article III standing because they did not allege any concrete injury as a result of the alleged conduct. Plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. 
  Intoccia v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (S.D.N.Y., April 20, 2015) 
  Plaintiffs filed this putative class action on behalf of themselves and all persons and entities who, directly or indirectly, purchased, renewed or paid premiums for Guaranteed Benefits Insurance Riders attached to variable annuity contracts with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company from 2009 through 2015 (the  Annuities ). The court consolidated     Weilert v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.   (S.D.N.Y., April 30, 2015) with the     Intoccia     case, and the consolidated, amended complaint alleges that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company inadequately disclosed in its statutory annual statements that certain reinsurance transactions with affiliated reinsurance companies were collateralized using  contractual parental guarantees,  and thereby allegedly misrepresented its financial condition and the adequacy of its reserves. The lawsuits seek recovery under Section 4226 of the New York Insurance Law of a statutory penalty in the amount of the premiums paid for Guaranteed Benefits Insurance Riders attached to the Annuities. The Court granted Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s motion to dismiss, adopting the reasoning of the     Robainas   decision  . Plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

Diversified Lending Group Litigations 
  Hartshorne v. MetLife Inc., et al. (Los Angeles County Superior Court, filed March 25, 2015) 
  Plaintiffs have named MetLife, Inc., MSI and NELICO in 12 related lawsuits in California state court alleging various causes of action including multiple negligence and statutory claims relating to a Ponzi scheme involving the Diversified Lending Group. In August 2016, a trial of claims by one of the plaintiffs, Christine Ramirez, resulted in a verdict against MetLife, Inc., MSI and NELICO for approximately   $200 thousand   in compensatory damages and   $15 million   in punitive damages. These companies intend to appeal this verdict. 
  Other Litigation 
  McGuire v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (E.D. Mich., filed February 22, 2012) 
  The fiduciary for the Union Carbide Employees  Pension Plan alleged that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which issued annuity contracts to fund some of the benefits the Plan provides, engaged in transactions that ERISA prohibits and violated duties under ERISA and federal common law by determining that no dividends were payable with respect to the contracts from and after 1999. The parties have resolved this matter, and the court has dismissed the action. 
  Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada Indemnity Claim 
  In 2006, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada ( Sun Life ), as successor to the purchaser of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s Canadian operations, filed a lawsuit in Toronto, seeking a declaration that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company remains liable for  market conduct claims  related to certain individual life insurance policies sold by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company that were subsequently transferred to Sun Life. In January 2010, the court found that Sun Life had given timely notice of its claim for indemnification but, because it found that Sun Life had not yet incurred an indemnifiable loss, granted Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s motion for summary judgment. Both parties agreed to consider the indemnity claim through arbitration. In September 2010, Sun Life notified Metropolitan Life Insurance Company that a purported class action lawsuit was filed against Sun Life in Toronto alleging sales practices claims regarding the policies sold by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and transferred to Sun Life. On August 30, 2011, Sun Life notified Metropolitan Life Insurance Company that another purported class action lawsuit was filed against Sun Life in Vancouver, BC alleging sales practices claims regarding certain of the same policies sold by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and transferred to Sun Life. Sun Life contends that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is obligated to indemnify Sun Life for some or all of the claims in these lawsuits. These sales practices cases against Sun Life are ongoing, and the Company is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss arising from this litigation. 
  Fauley v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, et al. (Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial Circuit, Lake County, Ill., July 3, 2014) 
  Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against defendants, including Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and a former MetLife financial services representative, alleging that the defendants sent unsolicited fax advertisements to plaintiff and others in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, as amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act, 47 U.S.C.   227. The court issued a final order certifying a nationwide settlement class and approving a settlement under which Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has agreed to pay up to   $23 million   to resolve claims as to fax advertisements sent between August 23, 2008 and August 7, 2014. On March 23, 2016, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the trial court s order. On September 28, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court denied an objector s petition for leave to appeal. 
  Voshall v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, April 8, 2015) 
  Plaintiff filed this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of himself and all persons covered under a long-term group disability income insurance policy issued by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to public entities in California between April 8, 2011 and April 8, 2015. Plaintiff alleges that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company improperly reduced benefits by including cost of living adjustments and employee paid contributions in the employer retirement benefits and other income that reduces the benefit payable under such policies. Plaintiff asserts causes of action for declaratory relief, violation of the California Business   Professions Code, breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously.

Martin v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (Superior Court of the State of California, County of Contra Costa, filed December 17, 2015) 
  Plaintiffs filed this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all California persons who have been charged compound interest by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in life insurance policy and/or premium loan balances within the last four years. Plaintiffs allege that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has engaged in a pattern and practice of charging compound interest on life insurance policy and premium loans without the borrower authorizing such compounding, and that this constitutes an unlawful business practice under California law. Plaintiff asserts causes of action for declaratory relief, violation of California s Unfair Competition Law and Usury Law, and unjust enrichment. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, restitution of interest, and damages in an unspecified amount. On April 12, 2016, the court granted Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs have filed a notice appealing this ruling. 
  Lau v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (S.D.N.Y. filed, December 3, 2015) 
  This putative class action lawsuit was filed by a single defined contribution plan participant on behalf of all ERISA plans whose assets were invested in Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s  Group Annuity Contract Stable Value Funds  within the past six years. The suit alleges breaches of fiduciary duty under ERISA and challenges the  spread  with respect to the stable value fund group annuity products sold to retirement plans. The allegations focus on the methodology Metropolitan Life Insurance Company uses to establish and reset the crediting rate, the terms under which plan participants are permitted to transfer funds from a stable value option to another investment option, the procedures followed if an employer terminates a contract, and the level of disclosure provided. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages in an unspecified amount. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously. 
  Newman v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (N.D. Ill., filed March 23, 2016) 
  Plaintiff filed this putative class action alleging causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, and violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, based on Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s class-wide increase in premiums charged for long-term care insurance policies. Plaintiff alleges a class consisting of herself and all persons over age 65 who selected a Reduced Pay at Age 65 payment feature and whose premium rates were increased after age 65. Plaintiff asserts that premiums could not be increased for these class members and/or that marketing material was misleading as to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s right to increase premiums. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory, statutory and punitive damages as well as recessionary and injunctive relief. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously. 
  Sales Practices Claims 
  Over the past several years, the Company has faced numerous claims, including class action lawsuits, alleging improper marketing or sales of individual life insurance policies, annuities, mutual funds, other products or the misuse of client assets. Some of the current cases seek substantial damages, including punitive and treble damages and attorneys  fees. The Company continues to defend vigorously against the claims in these matters. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for sales practices matters. 
  Summary 
  Putative or certified class action litigation and other litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in addition to those discussed previously and those otherwise provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of the Company s business, including, but not limited to, in connection with its activities as an insurer, investor and taxpayer. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning the Company s compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations.

  12. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees (continued)  

It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. In some of the matters referred to previously, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material effect upon the Company s financial position, based on information currently known by the Company s management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect. However, given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. 
   
  Commitments 
  Mortgage Loan Commitments 
  The Company commits to lend funds under mortgage loan commitments. The amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were   $3.7 billion   and   $4.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Commitments to Fund Partnership Investments, Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private Corporate Bond Investments 
  The Company commits to fund partnership investments and to lend funds under bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. The amounts of these unfunded commitments were   $4.9 billion   and   $4.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
   
  Guarantees 
  In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties such that it may be required to make payments now or in the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition, investment and other transactions, the Company has provided indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax, environmental and other specific liabilities and other indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Company provides indemnifications to counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as third-party lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to time limitations that vary in duration, including contractual limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than   $1 million   to   $127 million  , with a cumulative maximum of   $411 million  , while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future. Management believes that it is unlikely the Company will have to make any material payments under these indemnities, guarantees, or commitments. 
  In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of their representation of the Company s interests. Since these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these indemnities in the future. 
  The Company s recorded liabilities were   $5 million   and   $4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, for indemnities, guarantees and commitments.

Typical services provided under these agreements include management, policy administrative functions, investment advice and distribution services. Expenses incurred by the Company related to these agreements, included in other expenses, were   $304 million   and   $1.1 billion   for the   three months   and   nine months ended   September 30, 2016, respectively, and   $444 million   and   $1.2 billion   for the   three months   and   nine months ended   September 30, 2015, respectively, and were reimbursed to the Company by these affiliates. 
  The Company had net payables to affiliates, related to the items discussed above, of   $106 million   and   $282 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  See Notes   6   and   11   for additional information on related party transactions. 
  Sales Distribution Services 
  In July 2016, MetLife, Inc. completed the sale to MassMutual of MetLife, Inc. s U.S. retail advisor force and certain assets associated with the MetLife Premier Client Group, including all of the issued and outstanding shares of MSI. MassMutual   assumed all of the liabilities related to such assets and that arise or occur after the closing of the sale.

  13. Related Party Transactions (continued)  

Information regarding the significant effects of affiliated reinsurance included on the consolidated balance sheets was as follows at: 

The Company ceded two blocks of business to an affiliate on a   75%   coinsurance with funds withheld basis. Certain contractual features of these agreements qualify as embedded derivatives, which are separately accounted for at estimated fair value on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The embedded derivatives related to the funds withheld associated with these reinsurance agreements are included within other liabilities and increased the funds withheld balance by   $25 million   and   $8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Net derivative gains (losses) associated with these embedded derivatives were less than   ($1) million   and   ($17) million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and less than   $1 million   and   $10 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  The Company ceded risks to an affiliate related to guaranteed minimum benefit guarantees written directly by the Company. These ceded reinsurance agreements contain embedded derivatives and changes in their estimated fair value are also included within net derivative gains (losses). The embedded derivatives associated with the cessions are included within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables and were     $993 million     and     $712 million     at     September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  , respectively. Net derivative gains (losses) associated with the embedded derivatives were     ($33) million     and     $275 million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and     $155 million     and     $98 million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.    
  Certain contractual features of the closed block agreement with MRC create an embedded derivative, which is separately accounted for at estimated fair value on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The embedded derivative related to the funds withheld associated with this reinsurance agreement was included within other liabilities and increased the funds withheld balance by     $1.2 billion     and     $694 million     at     September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  , respectively. Net derivative gains (losses) associated with the embedded derivative were     ($3) million     and     ($512) million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and     ($5) million     and     $255 million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.    
  Th  e Company assumes risks from affiliates related to guaranteed minimum benefit guarantees written directly by the affiliates. These assumed reinsurance agreements contain embedded derivatives and changes in their estimated fair value are also included within net derivative gains (losses). The embedded derivatives associated with these agreements are included within policyholder account balances and were     $262 million     and     $126 million     at     September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  , respectively. Net derivative gains (losses) associated with the embedded derivatives were     $6 million     and     ($136) million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and     ($87) million     and     ($75) million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  In April 2016, the Company recaptured risks related to certain single premium deferred annuity contracts from MetLife USA. As a result of this recapture, the significant effects to the Company were a decrease in investments and cash and cash equivalents of   $4.3 billion   and a decrease in DAC of   $87 million  , offset by a decrease in other liabilities of   $4.0 billion  . The Company recognized a loss of   $95 million  , net of income tax, as a result of this reinsurance termination.

The Company expects to distribute such dividends in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to certain regulatory approvals. At the dividend effective date, the Company s stockholder s equity will be reduced by the aggregate carrying amount of GALIC and NELICO s assets in excess of their liabilities. The aggregate carrying amount of GALIC and NELICO s assets in excess of their liabilities was   $3.1 billion   at September 30, 2016.

Forward-Looking Statements and Other Financial Information 
  For purposes of this discussion,  MLIC,  the  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, a New York corporation incorporated in 1868, and its subsidiaries. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (MetLife, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates,  MetLife ). Management s narrative analysis of the Company s results of operations is presented pursuant to General Instruction H(2)(a) of Form 10-Q. This narrative analysis should be read in conjunction with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Annual Report ), the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements included below, the  Risk Factors  set forth in Part II, Item 1A, and the additional risk factors referred to therein, and the Company's interim condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. 
  This narrative analysis may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe  and other words and terms of similar meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results. Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. See  Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.  
  This narrative analysis includes references to our performance measure, operating earnings, that is not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). This measure is used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is also our GAAP measure of segment performance. Operating earnings allows analysis of our performance and facilitates comparisons to industry results. Forward-looking guidance provided on a non-GAAP basis cannot be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis because net income may fluctuate significantly if net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses move outside of estimated ranges. See    Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures  for definitions and a discussion of these measures, and    Results of Operations  for reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

This segment also includes the long-term care business, reported as part of the Company s former Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefit ( GVWB ) segment. 
                
    The Retirement and Income Solutions business (which represents most of the segment formerly known as Corporate Benefit Funding), and the Group Benefits business (consisting of the remaining components of the Company s former GVWB segment, including the individual disability insurance business previously reported in the former Retail segment), are reflected in a new segment, U.S. 
     These changes were applied retrospectively and did not have an impact on total consolidated net income or operating earnings in the prior periods. See Note   2   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company s segments. 
   
  Significant Events 
  In September 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved extraordinary dividends to MetLife, Inc. consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, General American Life Insurance Company and New England Life Insurance Company ( NELICO ). The Company expects to distribute such dividends in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to certain regulatory approvals. See Note   14   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In July 2016, MetLife, Inc. completed the sale to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company ( MassMutual ) of MetLife s U.S. retail advisor force and certain assets associated with the MetLife Premier Client Group, including all of the issued and outstanding shares of MetLife s affiliated broker-dealer, MetLife Securities, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (collectively, the  U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture ). MassMutual assumed all of the liabilities related to such assets that arise or occur at or after the closing of the sale. As part of the transactions, MetLife, Inc. and MassMutual entered into a product development agreement under which MetLife s U.S. retail business will be the exclusive developer of certain annuity products to be issued by MassMutual. In the MassMutual purchase agreement, MetLife, Inc. agreed to indemnify MassMutual for certain claims, liabilities and breaches of representations and warranties up to limits described in the purchase agreement. 
  On December 18, 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Council ( FSOC ) designated MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank systemically important financial institution ( non-bank SIFI ) subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  Federal Reserve Board ) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (collectively with the Federal Reserve Board, the  Federal Reserve ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the  FDIC ), as well as to enhanced supervision and prudential standards. On March 30, 2016, the D.C. District Court ordered that the designation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI by the FSOC be rescinded. On April 8, 2016, the FSOC appealed the D.C. District Court s order to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. If the FSOC prevails on appeal or designates MetLife, Inc. as systemically important as part of its ongoing review of non-bank financial companies, MetLife, Inc. could once again be subject to regulation as a non-bank SIFI. See  Business   Regulation   Regulation of MetLife, Inc. as a Non-Bank SIFI  in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Business   Regulatory Developments  and similarly named sections under the caption  Risk Factors.

On January 12, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced its plan to pursue the Separation. Additionally, on July 21, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced that, following the Separation, the separated business will be rebranded as  Brighthouse Financial.  On October 5, 2016, Brighthouse Financial, Inc., a subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. ( Brighthouse ), filed a registration statement on Form 10 (the  Form 10 ) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The information statement filed as an exhibit to the Form 10 disclosed that MetLife, Inc. intends to include MetLife Insurance Company USA ( MetLife USA ), NELICO, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, First MetLife Investors Insurance Company, MetLife Advisers, LLC and certain captive reinsurance companies in the proposed separated business and distribute at least 80.1% of the shares of Brighthouse s common stock on a pro rata basis to the holders of MetLife, Inc. common stock. The ultimate form and timing of the Separation will be influenced by a number of factors, including regulatory considerations and economic conditions. MetLife continues to evaluate and pursue structural alternatives for the proposed Separation. MetLife expects that the life insurance closed block and the life and annuity business sold through Metropolitan Life Insurance Company will not be a part of Brighthouse Financial. The Separation remains subject to certain conditions including, among others, obtaining final approval from the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors, receipt of a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and an opinion from MetLife s tax advisor regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters, and an SEC declaration of the effectiveness of the Form 10. 
   
  Regulatory Developments 
  The U.S. insurance industry is regulated primarily at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. In addition, we are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of the states of domicile of our U.S. insurance companies. Furthermore, some of our operations, products and services are subject to consumer protection laws, securities regulation, environmental and unclaimed property laws and regulations, and to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ). If MetLife, Inc. were re-designated as a non-bank SIFI, it could also be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC and, as a subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., we could be affected by such regulation. We may also be affected by any additional capital requirements to which MetLife, Inc. may become subject as a global systemically important insurer ( G-SII ).

  Insurance Regulation 
   
  Insurance Regulatory Examinations and Other Activities 
  The International Association of Insurance Supervisors ( IAIS ) has encouraged U.S. insurance supervisors, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services ( NYDFS ), to establish Supervisory Colleges for U.S.-based insurance groups with international operations, including MetLife, to facilitate cooperation and coordination among the insurance groups  supervisors and to enhance the member regulators  understanding of an insurance group s risk profile. A September 2016 Supervisory College was chaired by the NYDFS and attended by MetLife s key U.S. and international regulators. MetLife, Inc. has not received any reports or recommendations from the Supervisory College meeting, and we do not expect any outcome of the meeting to have a material adverse effect on our business. 
   
  New York s Proposed Cybersecurity Regulation 
  Since late 2015, the NYDFS has been considering a potential cybersecurity regulation for those banking and insurance entities under its jurisdiction. On September 13, 2016, the NYDFS released a proposed regulation for a 45-day comment period. The proposed regulation would require any person operating under a license or similar authorization under the New York banking, insurance or financial services law to establish a cybersecurity program meeting certain core functions, adopt a cybersecurity policy, appoint a Chief Information Security Officer, and oversee the cybersecurity practices of third-party service providers, among other requirements.

ERISA Considerations 
  The Department of Labor ( DOL ) issued new regulations on April 6, 2016 with an effective date for most provisions of April 10, 2017. These regulations substantially expand the definition of  investment advice  and thereby broaden the circumstances under which MLIC or its representatives, in providing investment advice with respect to ERISA plans, plan participants or Individual Retirement Accounts or Annuities ( IRAs ), will be deemed a fiduciary under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). Pursuant to the final regulations, certain communications with plans, plan participants and IRA holders, including the marketing of products, and marketing of investment management or advisory services, could be deemed fiduciary investment advice, thus, causing increased exposure to fiduciary liability if the distributor does not recommend what is in the client s best interests. The DOL also issued amendments to certain of its prohibited transaction exemptions, and issued a new exemption, that applies more onerous disclosure and contract requirements to, and increases fiduciary requirements and fiduciary liability exposure in respect of, transactions involving ERISA plans, plan participants and IRAs. On September 27, 2016, the DOL released Frequently Asked Questions on the new exemption and amendments to certain existing exemptions, which provide guidance concerning the application and implementation of the new and amended prohibited transaction exemptions. 
  We anticipate that we will need to undertake certain additional tasks in order to comply with certain of the exemptions provided in the DOL regulations, including additional compliance reviews of material shared with distributors, wholesaler and call center training and product reporting and analysis. See  Risk Factors   Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and In Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.   
  On July 11, 2016, the DOL, the IRS and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation proposed revisions to the Form 5500, the form used for ERISA annual reporting. The revisions affect employee pension and welfare benefit plans, including our ERISA plans, and require audits of information, self-directed brokerage account disclosure and additional extensive disclosure. We cannot predict the effect these proposals will have on our business, if enacted, or what other proposals may be made, what legislation may be introduced or enacted, or what impact any such legislation may have on our results of operations and financial condition. 
   
  Designation Process and Policy Measures that May Apply to Global Systemically Important Insurers 
  The IAIS, an association of insurance supervisors and regulators and a member of the Financial Stability Board ( FSB ), an international entity established to coordinate, develop and promote regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability, is participating in the FSB s initiative to identify and manage global systemically important financial institutions. To this end, the IAIS published a methodology to assess the systemic relevance of global insurers and a framework of policy measures to be applied to G-SIIs and, on this basis, the FSB again so designated MetLife, Inc. in 2015. The IAIS/FSB process is separate from the U.S. FSOC designation process and MetLife, Inc. remains a G-SII in spite of the rescission of its U.S. non-bank SIFI designation on March 30, 2016. The global designation process is an annual process. Every three years, the IAIS evaluates whether updates to its assessment methodology are necessary. 
  Current standards call for G-SIIs to be subject to higher loss absorbency requirements ( HLA ). Given the absence of a common global base on which to calculate HLA for insurers, the FSB directed the IAIS to develop basic capital requirements ( BCR ). The first version of the IAIS HLA framework was endorsed by the FSB and the G20 in September and November 2015, respectively, and the BCR and HLA requirements are expected to be refined based on data confidentially submitted by certain G-SIIs to their group-wide supervisors until they are fully adopted and implemented in 2019. The IAIS published a new assessment methodology on June 16, 2016 which was used this year to assess a pool of approximately 50 insurers, including MetLife, Inc. The new methodology reflects changes in the previous definitions of non-traditional and non-insurance activity, along with certain other changes in both quantitative and qualitative assessments. The assessments are complete and designations are pending. It is uncertain whether MetLife, Inc. will be designated a G-SII by the FSB under this new methodology. 
   
  Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:  
           (i) 
    liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance;  
              (ii) 
    capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ( DAC ) and the establishment and amortization of value of business acquired ( VOBA   
              (iii) 
    estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;  
              (iv) 
    investment impairments;  
              (v) 
    estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation;  
              (vi) 
    measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;  
              (vii) 
    measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and    
              (viii) 
    liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.    
     In applying our accounting policies, we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
  The above critical accounting estimates are described in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates  and Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2015 Annual Report. 
  We accelerated the annual review of our actuarial assumptions for our variable annuities business from the third quarter to the second quarter of 2016 in connection with the proposed Separation. As a result of this review, we made changes to policyholder behavior and long-term economic assumptions, as well as risk margins. With respect to policyholder behavior, which was the significant update for the second quarter of 2016, we have recorded charges, and in some cases benefits, in prior years as a result of the availability of sufficient and credible data at the conclusion of each review. As an example, in 2012, we recorded a charge to reflect better than expected persistency; and in 2014, we recorded a charge as we began to reflect lower utilization of the elective annuitization option in early generations of our guaranteed minimum income benefit ( GMIBs ). In addition, in the third quarter of 2016, we performed the annual review of our actuarial assumptions for all of our remaining annuity and life businesses.

  Economic Capital 
  Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in MetLife s and the Company s business. 
  MetLife s economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. Economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. Areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. MetLife s management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards.  
  Segment net investment income is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact the Company s consolidated net investment income, operating earnings or net income (loss). 
  
   91 

     Table of Contents  

Net investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment s specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company s product pricing. 
   
  Results of Operations 
   
  Consolidated Results 
  Business Overview.   Overall sales improved from prior period levels as a result of increased sales of certain products within our segments for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. An overall increase in sales from our U.S. segment was primarily driven by the timing of our funding agreement issuances and an increase in structured settlement annuity sales due to price competition, partially offset by lower pension risk transfers and decreases in sales of income annuities and post-retirement benefit products. In our MetLife Holdings segment, life and annuity sales declined as a result of the proposed Separation and the U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, income (loss) before provision for income tax decreased $382 million (increased $362 million, net of income tax) from the prior period primarily driven by unfavorable changes in net derivative gains (losses) and net investment gains (losses), partially offset by an increase in operating earnings. 
  Management of Investment Portfolio and Hedging Market Risks with Derivatives  . We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined asset/liability management principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. We also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio to hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity market levels. 
  
   92 

     Table of Contents  

We purchase investments to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of both impairments and realized gains and losses on investments sold. 
  We use freestanding interest rate, equity, credit and currency derivatives to hedge certain invested assets and insurance liabilities. Certain of these hedges are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those hedges not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. 
  Certain direct or assumed variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). We use reinsurance and derivatives to hedge the market and other risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. Ceded reinsurance of direct variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits generally contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). The valuation of these embedded derivatives includes a nonperformance risk adjustment, which is unhedged, and can be a significant driver of net derivative gains (losses) and volatility in earnings, but does not have an economic impact on us. 
  Net Derivative Gains (Losses).   Direct, assumed and ceded variable annuity embedded derivatives, as well as the associated freestanding derivatives, are referred to as  VA program derivatives  in the following table. All other embedded derivatives and freestanding derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as  non-VA program derivatives  in the following table. The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives: 

93 

     Table of Contents  

The unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $621 million ($404 million, net of income tax). This was primarily due to long-term interest rates decreasing less in the current period versus the prior period, unfavorably impacting receive-fixed interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions and interest rate floors, primarily hedging long duration liability portfolios. Additionally, the U.S. dollar weakened in comparison to the Euro in the current period versus remaining unchanged in the prior period, unfavorably impacting foreign currency swaps. In addition, a change in the value of the assets underlying reinsurance-related funds withheld unfavorably impacted non-VA embedded derivatives. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged. 
  The unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $142 million ($92 million, net of income tax). This was due to an unfavorable change of $78 million ($51 million, net of income tax) in market and other risks on direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of the impact of market and other risks on the ceded reinsurance embedded derivatives and net of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks, as well as by an unfavorable change of $64 million ($42 million, net of income tax) related to the change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of the impact of the nonperformance risk adjustment on the ceded variable annuity embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged. 
  The foregoing unfavorable change of $78 million ($51 million, net of income tax) was primarily driven by changes in market factors. 
  The primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows: 
             
    Long-term interest rates decreased less in the current period than in the prior period, contributing to an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives and a favorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the 30-year U.S. swap rate decreased by 3% in the current period and decreased by 14% in the prior period. 
                
    Key equity index levels mainly increased in the current period and decreased in the prior period, contributing to an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives and a favorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the Standard   Poor s Ratings Services ( S P ) 500 Index increased by 3% in the current period and decreased by 7% in the prior period. 
                
    Key equity volatility measures decreased in the current period and were mixed in the prior period, contributing to a favorable change in our embedded derivatives and an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives. 
     We calculate the nonperformance risk adjustment as the change in the embedded derivative discounted at the risk-adjusted rate (which includes our own credit spread to the extent that the embedded derivative is in-the-money) less the change in the embedded derivative discounted at the risk-free rate. The unfavorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives of $84 million ($55 million, net of income tax) was primarily due to an unfavorable change of $63 million, before income tax, as a result of changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees, and an unfavorable change of $21 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread. The favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the ceded variable annuity embedded derivatives of $20 million ($13 million, net of income tax) was due to a favorable change of $13 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread, and a favorable change of $7 million, before income tax, as a result of the impact of changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees. 
  When equity index levels decrease in isolation, the direct and assumed variable annuity guarantees become more valuable to policyholders, which results in an increase in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk-adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives. The opposite impact occurs with respect to the nonperformance risk adjustment on the ceded variable annuity guarantees. 
  When the risk-free interest rate decreases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a higher valuation of the liability than if the risk-free interest rate had remained constant. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk-adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free interest rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives. The opposite impact occurs with respect to the nonperformance risk adjustment on the ceded variable annuity guarantees.

     Table of Contents  

When our own credit spread increases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a lower valuation of the liability than if our own credit spread had remained constant. As a result, a gain is created from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives. The opposite impact occurs with respect to the nonperformance risk adjustment on the ceded variable annuity guarantees when the reinsurer s credit spread increases in isolation. For each of these primary market drivers, the opposite effect occurs when they move in the opposite direction. 
  Generally, a higher portion of the ceded reinsurance for GMIBs is accounted for as an embedded derivative as compared to the direct guarantees since the settlement provisions of the reinsurance agreements generally meet the accounting criteria of  net settlement.  This mismatch in accounting can lead to significant volatility in earnings, even though the risks inherent in these direct guarantees are fully covered by the ceded reinsurance. 
  Net Investment Gains (Losses)  . The unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $90 million ($59 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects lower gains on real estate, partially offset by current period gains on sales of fixed maturity securities. 
  Actuarial Assumption Review  . We annually review our long-term actuarial assumptions for policyholder behavior, market returns and other actuarial items. With respect to policyholder behavior, we have recorded charges, and in some cases benefits, in prior years as a result of the availability of sufficient and credible data at the conclusion of each review. See    Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.  During the current period, we performed a review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC for our annuity and life businesses with the exception of our variable annuity business, which was reviewed in the second quarter of 2016 in connection with the proposed Separation.  
  Results for the current period include a $94 million loss ($61 million, net of income tax) associated with our annual assumption review related to reserves and DAC, of which a $1 million gain ($1 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $94 million charge, a gain of $19 million ($12 million, net of income tax) was related to reserves and a loss of $113 million ($73 million, net of income tax) was associated with DAC.  
  The $1 million gain recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with this review of actuarial assumptions was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives - direct and assumed guarantees and market and other risks in embedded derivatives - ceded reinsurance captions in the table above. 
  As a result of our current period annual actuarial assumption review, changes were made to economic, policyholder behavior and mortality assumptions, as well as operational updates. The most significant impacts were in the MetLife Holdings segment and are summarized as follows:  
             
    Changes in policyholder behavior, mortality assumptions and economic assumptions resulted in reserve increases, net of reinsurance, offset by favorable DAC for a net gain of $13 million ($8 million, net of income tax).  
                
    The remaining updates resulted in reserve decreases, net of reinsurance, offset by unfavorable DAC for a net loss of $107 million ($69 million, net of income tax). The most notable assumption update related to our projection of closed block results and resulted in a net loss.  
     Results for the prior period include a $163 million ($106 million, net of income tax), net of reinsurance, charge associated with our annual actuarial assumption review related to reserves and DAC for all of our annuity and life businesses, of which a $2 million loss ($1 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $163 million charge, $60 million ($39 million, net of income tax) was related to reserves and $103 million ($67 million, net of income tax) was associated with DAC.  
  Taxes  . Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $123 million, or 16% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, compared with $867 million, or 76% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s current and prior period effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% typically due to non-taxable investment income and tax credits for low income housing. Current period results include a one-time tax benefit of $36 million for tax audit settlements. Prior period results include a one-time tax charge of $557 million recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties.

Operating Earnings.   As more fully described in    Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures,  we use operating earnings, which does not equate to net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP, to analyze our performance, evaluate segment performance, and allocate resources. We believe that the presentation of operating earnings, as we measure it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). Operating earnings increased $912 million, net of income tax, to $847 million, net of income tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from a loss of $65 million, net of income tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, income (loss) before provision for income tax decreased $2.0 billion ($674 million, net of income tax) from the prior period primarily driven by unfavorable changes in net derivative gains (losses) and net investment gains (losses), partially offset by a favorable change in operating earnings. 
  Net Derivative Gains (Losses).   Direct, assumed and ceded variable annuity embedded derivatives, as well as the associated freestanding derivatives, are referred to as  VA program derivatives  in the following table. All other embedded derivatives and all freestanding derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as  non-VA program derivatives  in the following table. The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives: 

The unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $543 million ($353 million, net of income tax). This was unfavorable change was driven by a change in the value of the assets underlying reinsurance-related funds withheld unfavorably impacting non-VA embedded derivatives. This unfavorable change was partially offset by a favorable change due to long-term interest rates decreasing more in the current period versus the prior period, favorably impacting receive-fixed interest rate swaps, interest rate total return swaps and interest rates floors. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged.

     Table of Contents  

The unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $846 million ($550 million, net of income tax). This was due to an unfavorable change of $930 million ($605 million, net of income tax) in market and other risks on direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of the impact of market and other risks on the ceded reinsurance embedded derivatives and net of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks, partially offset by a favorable change of $84 million ($55 million, net of income tax) related to the change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of the impact of the nonperformance risk adjustment on the ceded variable annuity embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged. 
  The foregoing unfavorable change of $930 million ($605 million, net of income tax) was primarily driven by changes in other risks and market factors. 
  The primary changes in other risks are summarized as follows: 
             
    Updates to actuarial policyholder behavior assumptions within the valuation model. For details, see    Actuarial Assumption Review.  
                
    An increase in the risk margin adjustment, measuring policyholder behavior risks, which was also affected by the actuarial assumption update, along with market and interest rate changes.  
                
    A combination of other factors, including reserve changes influenced by benefit features and actual policyholder behavior. 
     The primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows: 
             
    Long-term interest rates decreased more in the current period than in the prior period, contributing to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the 30-year U.S. swap rate decreased by 32% in the current period and decreased by 7% in the prior period. 
                
    Key equity index levels were mixed in the current period and mostly decreased in the prior period, contributing to an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives and a favorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the S P 500 Index increased by 6% in the current period and decreased by 7% in the prior period. 
     We calculate the nonperformance risk adjustment as the change in the embedded derivative discounted at the risk-adjusted rate (which includes our own credit spread to the extent that the embedded derivative is in-the-money) less the change in the embedded derivative discounted at the risk-free rate. The favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives of $140 million ($91 million, net of income tax) was primarily due to a favorable change of $138 million, before income tax, as a result of changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees, and a favorable change of $2 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread. The unfavorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the ceded variable annuity embedded derivatives of $56 million ($36 million, net of income tax) was due to an unfavorable change of $52 million, before income tax, as a result of the impact of changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees, and an unfavorable change of $4 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread. 
  Net Investment Gains (Losses)  . The unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $149 million ($97 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects lower gains in real estate and real estate joint ventures and higher impairments on common stock, and were partially offset by increased net gains on the transfer of fixed maturity securities to MetLife USA, related to the recapture of risks related to certain single premium deferred annuity contracts. 
  Actuarial Assumption Review  . Results for the current period include a non-cash charge of $722 million ($469 million, net of income tax) associated with the annual review of actuarial assumptions, of which $798 million ($519 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $722 million charge, $787 million ($512 million, net of income tax) was related to reserves and a benefit of $65 million ($43 million, net of income tax) was associated with DAC.   
  The $798 million loss recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with this review of assumptions was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives - direct and assumed guarantees and market and other risks in embedded derivatives - ceded reinsurance captions in the table above.

     Table of Contents  

As a result of the annual review of actuarial assumptions, changes were made to economic, policyholder behavior and mortality assumptions, as well as operational updates. The significant impacts of the assumption review were on the variable annuity block of business and are summarized as follows: 
             
    Changes in policyholder behavior assumptions resulted in reserve increases, partially offset by favorable DAC amortization resulting in a net charge of $444 million ($289 million, net of income tax). The policyholder behavior assumption changes included:  
                 
    Lower utilization of the elective annuitization option on the guarantee riders on the contracts; 
                 
    Lower election of the guaranteed principal option in certain of our GMIBs, which, if exercised, returns to the policyholder the original purchase payment amounts; 
                 
    Adjusting the rate at which policyholders withdrew funds through systematic withdrawals; and 
                 
    Higher policyholder persistency related to the portion of the business that will remain with the Company after the proposed Separation, dependent on the amount a contract is in-the-money. 
                
    Changes in economic assumptions resulted in reserve increases and unfavorable DAC amortization resulting in a charge of $90 million ($59 million, net of income tax). These changes include reducing the long-term separate account return assumption from 7.25% to 7.00% (from 7.00% to 6.75% for GMIB s invested in managed volatility funds), and reducing the projected ultimate 10-year treasury rate from 4.50% to 4.25%. 
                
    The remaining updates resulted in reserve increases and unfavorable DAC resulting in a charge of $186 million ($121 million, net of income tax). The most notable assumption update related to our projection of closed block results and resulted in a net loss.  
     Results for the prior period include a $163 million ($106 million, net of income tax), net of reinsurance, charge associated with our annual assumption review related to reserves and DAC, of which a $2 million loss ($1 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $163 million charge, $60 million ($39 million, net of income tax) was related to reserves and $103 million ($67 million, net of income tax) was associated with DAC.  
  Taxes  . Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $232 million, or 14% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, compared with $1.6 billion, or 43% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% typically due to non-taxable investment income, and tax credits for low income housing. Current period results include a one-time tax benefit of $36 million for tax audit settlements. Prior period results include a one-time tax charge of $557 million recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties. 
  Operating Earnings.   Operating earnings increased $280 million, net of income tax, to $1.9 billion, net of income tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.7 billion, net of income tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Consolidated Results   Operating 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Overview  . The primary drivers of the increase in operating earnings were prior period charges for taxes and related interest expenses, as well as higher investment yields. Our financial results include fees earned related to an affiliated reinsurance agreement, which were recorded in other revenues, but were almost entirely offset by related charges in other expenses. 
  Business Growth  . We benefited from higher sales and business growth in certain of our products. An increase in our investment portfolio from premiums and deposits in our Retirement and Income Solutions business and positive net flows in our MetLife Holdings segment generated higher net investment income. These increases in net investment income were partially offset by a reduction in the invested asset base due to the recapture of an assumed fixed annuity agreement with an affiliate in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, consistent with the growth in average invested assets from increased premiums, interest credited on long-duration contracts increased. Lower interest expense related to the aforementioned recapture of the assumed fixed annuity agreement resulted in an increase in operating earnings. The changes in business growth discussed above resulted in an   $18 million   increase in operating earnings. 
  Market Factors  . Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency fluctuations continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields increased as a result of higher returns on alternate investments, prior period mark-to-market losses on trading securities and higher income on currency and interest rate derivatives. These favorable changes were partially offset by the adverse impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio described above were invested at lower yields. In addition, lower interest crediting rates, consistent with the sustained low interest rate environment, contributed to the increase to operating earnings. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a   $58 million   increase in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments  . Unfavorable underwriting resulted in a   $35 million   decrease in operating earnings and was primarily due to unfavorable mortality, primarily in our MetLife Holdings and U.S. segments, partially offset by favorable morbidity, primarily in our U.S. segment. The impact of the annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of   $11 million   and was primarily related to unfavorable DAC unlockings in our MetLife Holdings segment. The annual actuarial assumption review in the current period included our annuity and life businesses with the exception of our variable annuity business, which was reviewed in the second quarter of 2016; whereas, the annual review in the prior period included all of our annuity and life businesses. 
  Expenses and Taxes  . Operating earnings increased due to a decline in expenses of   $245 million  , mainly the result of a $235 million charge for interest on uncertain tax positions in the prior period. The Company s effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% typically due to non-taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. Current period results include a one-time tax benefit of $36 million for tax audit settlements. Prior period results include a one-time tax charge of $557 million recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties. In addition, the Company realized additional tax benefits of $18 million compared to the prior period, primarily from the higher utilization of tax preferenced investments. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Overview  . The primary drivers of the increase in operating earnings were prior period charges for taxes and related interest expenses, partially offset by lower investment yields and refinements to DAC and certain insurance liabilities. Our financial results include fees earned related to an affiliated reinsurance agreement, which were recorded in other revenues, but were almost entirely offset by related charges in other expenses. 
  Business Growth.   We benefited from higher sales and business growth in certain of our products. An increase in our investment portfolio from premiums and deposits in our Retirement and Income Solutions business, positive net flows from our life businesses in our MetLife Holdings segment and positive net flows in our Group Benefits business generated higher net investment income. These increases in net investment income were partially offset by a reduction in the invested asset base due to the aforementioned recapture of an assumed fixed annuity agreement with an affiliate. In addition, consistent with the growth in average invested assets from increased premiums, interest credited on long-duration contracts increased. Lower interest expense related to the aforementioned recapture of the assumed fixed annuity agreement resulted in an increase in operating earnings. The changes in business growth discussed above resulted in a   $42 million   increase in operating earnings.

Market Factors.   Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets and foreign currency fluctuations continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. The sustained low interest rate environment resulted in a decline in net investment income on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio described above were invested at lower yields. Additionally, investment yields decreased as a result of lower returns on other limited partnership interests, real estate joint ventures and alternative investments. Additionally, lower earnings on our securities lending program resulted from lower margins due to the impact of a flatter yield curve, as margins correlate more to the slope of the yield curve rather than the absolute level of interest rates, as well as lower program size. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by higher income on currency and interest rate derivatives and resulted in a   $346 million   decrease in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments  . Unfavorable underwriting decreased operating earnings by   $22 million   as unfavorable mortality and morbidity in our MetLife Holdings segment was partially offset by favorable mortality in our U.S. segment. The impact of the annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both periods, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of   $42 million   and was primarily related to unfavorable DAC unlockings in our MetLife Holdings segment. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related and other liabilities, which were recorded in both periods, resulted in a   $90 million   decrease in operating earnings, primarily in our MetLife Holdings and U.S. segments.  
  Expenses and Taxes  . Operating earnings increased due to a decline in expenses of   $99 million  , mainly the result of the aforementioned $235 million charge for interest on uncertain tax positions in the prior period, partially offset by costs associated with the aforementioned recapture of an assumed fixed annuity agreement. In addition, expenses declined as a result of lower costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects. The Company s effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% typically due to non-taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. Current period results include a one-time tax benefit of $36 million for tax audit settlements. Prior period results included the aforementioned one-time tax charge of $557 million recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties. In addition, the Company realized additional tax benefits of $54 million compared to the prior period, primarily from the higher utilization of tax preferenced investments.

  U.S. 
  Business Overview.   An increase in sales was primarily driven by the timing of our funding agreement issuances in our Retirement and Income Solutions business. Funding ratios for defined benefit pension plans of S P 500 companies continued to fall in 2016, limiting their ability to engage in full pension plan buyouts. However, we expect that customers may choose to close out portions of pension plans over time, with the largest volume of business generally occurring near the end of any year. The impact of this decline in funding ratios for defined benefit pension plans of S P 500 companies was lower pension risk transfers, which resulted in lower premiums. In addition, sales of income annuities and post-retirement benefit products were lower. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of a change in competitive pricing in the market, which drove an increase in structured settlement annuity sales. Changes in premiums for the Retirement and Income Solutions business were almost entirely offset by the related changes in policyholder benefits and claims. Sales improved across the Group Benefits business compared to the prior period.  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Business Growth  . The impact of higher deposits and funding agreement issuances in the current period resulted in higher invested assets, which drove an increase in net investment income. However, consistent with the growth in average invested assets from increased premiums, interest credited on long-duration contracts increased. In addition, an increase in other operating expenses, mainly the result of growth across the segment, was more than offset by the remaining increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. The combined impact of the items discussed above increased operating earnings by $42 million.

Market Factors  . Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets and foreign currency fluctuations continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields increased driven by higher income on interest rate derivatives, higher returns on real estate and real estate joint ventures and hedge funds. These increases were partially offset by the adverse impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on our fixed maturity securities, as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio described above were invested at lower yields, as well as lower returns on private equities. In addition, lower interest crediting rates, consistent with the sustained low interest rate environment, contributed to the increase to operating earnings. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $6 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting  . Less favorable mortality in our term life business, mainly due to higher severity, was partially offset by favorable claims experience in our universal life business, which resulted in a decrease of $25 million in operating earnings. Favorable claims experience in our dental business combined with favorable morbidity in our individual disability business drove an increase in operating earnings of $20 million. Favorable mortality from our income annuity business was mostly offset by less favorable mortality in our specialized life insurance products. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Business Growth  . The impact of deposits, funding agreement issuances and increased premiums in the current period resulted in higher average invested assets, improving net investment income. However, consistent with the growth in average invested assets from increased premiums, interest credited on long-duration contracts increased. In addition, an increase in other operating expenses, mainly the result of growth across the segment, was more than offset by the remaining increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. The combined impact of the items discussed above increased operating earnings by $89 million. 
  Market Factors  . Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets and foreign currency fluctuations continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields decreased as a result of the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on fixed maturity securities, as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio described above were invested at lower yields, as well as lower returns on other limited partnership interests and alternative investments. Additionally, lower investment earnings on our securities lending program resulted primarily from the impact of a flatter yield curve, as margins correlate more to the slope of the yield curve rather than the absolute level of interest rates, as well as a lower program size. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by higher income on interest rate and currency derivatives and higher returns on real estate and real estate joint ventures. Certain of our funding agreements and guaranteed interest contract liabilities have interest credited rates that are contractually tied to current market rates, specifically the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) and, as a result, a higher average interest credited rate drove an increase in interest credited expense. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $155 million decrease in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments  . Unfavorable claims experience in our group disability and dental businesses were mostly offset by favorable claims experience in our individual disability and voluntary businesses and resulted in a slight decrease in operating earnings. Favorable mortality in the current period, mainly due to favorable claims experience in our life business, resulted in a $28 million increase in operating earnings. Less favorable mortality from our specialized life insurance products and pension risk transfer business resulted in a $14 million decrease in operating earnings. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in both periods, resulted in a $24 million decrease in operating earnings.

MetLife Holdings 
  Business Overview  . As a result of the proposed Separation and the U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture, we have discontinued marketing of life and annuity products in this segment, which has led to lower sales. A significant portion of our operating earnings is driven by separate account balances. Most directly, these balances determine asset-based fee income but they also impact DAC amortization and asset-based commissions. Separate account balances are driven by sales, movements in the market, surrenders, withdrawals, benefit payments, transfers and policy charges. Separate account balances have increased due to market performance, partially offset by the impact of negative net flows, as benefits, surrenders and withdrawals exceeded sales. While net flows are still negative, we are seeing stability in surrenders and withdrawals. Although we have discontinued selling our long-term care product, we continue to collect premiums and administer the existing block of business, which contributed to asset growth in the segment. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Business Growth  . A decrease in our invested asset base was primarily due to the recapture of an assumed fixed annuity reinsurance agreement with an affiliate in the second quarter of 2016. This decline was partially offset by positive net flows in our life business coupled with the aforementioned impact of our long-term care business on asset growth, resulting in a decrease in net investment income. Consistent with the asset growth in the long-term care business, interest credited on insurance liabilities increased. In addition, the impact of lower sales and lower surrender charges in the current period reduced operating earnings. More than offsetting these decreases in operating earnings was lower interest expense related to the aforementioned recapture of the assumed fixed annuity agreement. The net impact of the aforementioned items resulted in a $4 million increase in operating earnings.

Market Factors  . Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Higher returns on other limited partnership interests and increased prepayment fees contributed to this increase in operating earnings. In addition, the impact of lower average crediting rates on certain insurance liabilities and a decrease in DAC amortization contributed to the increase in operating earnings. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on net investment income, specifically from fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans as proceeds from maturing investments were reinvested at lower yields. In addition, we had lower income on interest rate derivatives. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in an $8 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments  . Unfavorable mortality in our universal life and traditional life, businesses was partially offset by favorable morbidity in our long-term care business and resulted in a decrease of $34 million in operating earnings. The results of our annual review of actuarial assumptions resulted in a decrease in operating earnings of $9 million. The annual actuarial assumption review in the current period included our annuity and life businesses with the exception of our U.S. variable annuity business, which was reviewed in the second quarter of 2016; whereas, the annual review in the prior period included all of our annuity and life businesses. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities recorded in the current period resulted in an increase in operating earnings of $7 million. In addition, an increase in policyholder dividends in the closed block, which we instituted in the fourth quarter of 2015, decreased operating earnings by $10 million. 
  Expenses  . Operating earnings increased due to a decline in expenses of $10 million, mainly the result of lower amortization of deferred reinsurance commissions related to certain variable annuity reinsurance agreements entered into with an affiliate.  
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Business Growth  . Our life, annuities and long-term care businesses experienced net asset growth, which resulted in higher net investment income; however, consistent with the aforementioned asset growth, interest credited on insurance liabilities also increased. The aforementioned recapture of an assumed fixed annuity reinsurance agreement resulted in lower interest expense, which was partially offset by an increase in DAC amortization. These increases were partially offset by a lower invested asset base due to the aforementioned recapture of an assumed fixed annuity reinsurance agreement, the impact of lower sales and lower surrender charges in the current period. The combined impact of the items discussed above resulted in a $19 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Market Factors  . Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields decreased on our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio described above were invested at lower yields. In addition, we had lower income on interest rate derivatives and alternative investments, as well as lower returns on other limited partnership interests. These decreases in net investment income were partially offset by higher prepayment fees and higher income on currency derivatives. In the deferred annuity business, operating earnings declined due to lower asset-based fee income, as average separate account balances decreased and DAC amortization increased. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $182 million decrease in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments  . Unfavorable claims experience in our long-term care business, unfavorable mortality in our traditional life businesses and less favorable fund returns related to a significant reinsurance treaty resulted in a $37 million decrease in operating earnings. The impact of our annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both periods, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of $33 million and was primarily related to unfavorable DAC unlockings. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in both periods resulted in a $66 million decrease in operating earnings, which includes a current period reserve adjustment resulting from modeling improvements in the reserving process in our universal life business. In addition, an increase in policyholder dividends in the closed block, which we instituted in the fourth quarter of 2015, decreased operating earnings by $19 million. 
  Expenses  . A $162 million net increase in expenses was primarily the result of costs associated with the aforementioned recapture of an assumed fixed annuity agreement. This increase in expenses was partially offset by lower amortization of deferred reinsurance commissions related to certain variable annuity reinsurance agreements entered into with an affiliate, as well as lower technology and employee-related costs.

Incremental Tax Benefit  . Corporate   Other benefits from the impact of certain permanent tax preferenced items, including non-taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. As a result, our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. The current period includes a one-time tax benefit of $36 million for tax audit settlements. The prior period included the aforementioned tax charge of $557 million, which was recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties. In addition, we had higher utilization of tax preferenced items, which increased our operating earnings by $21 million over the prior period. 
  Other  . The prior period included the aforementioned $235 million charge for interest on uncertain tax positions. The prior period also included a $7 million impairment charge on a real estate property. These increases were partially offset by a $7 million decrease in refunds received for favorable outcomes on prior years  tax audits and $5 million of higher interest on uncertain tax positions in the current period. Additionally, our results include fees earned related to an affiliated reinsurance agreement, which were recorded in other revenues, but were almost entirely offset by related charges in other expenses.

This was primarily related to lower fees and higher employee-related expenses in our life business. In addition, the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both periods, resulted in a decrease in operating earnings of $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher results from our start-up operations. 
  Other Net Investment Income  . A $70 million decrease in other net investment income was driven by a lower invested asset base, as well as lower returns on real estate and real estate joint ventures and private equities. These decreases were partially offset by prior period mark-to-market losses on trading securities. 
  Corporate Initiatives and Projects  . Expenses associated with corporate initiatives and projects decreased by $32 million, primarily due to lower relocation costs, severance and consulting expenses associated with certain enterprise-wide initiatives. 
  Incremental Tax Benefit  . Corporate   Other benefits from the impact of certain permanent tax preferenced items, including non-taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. As a result, our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. The current period includes a one-time tax benefit of $36 million for tax audit settlements. The prior period included the aforementioned tax charge of $557 million, which was recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties. In addition, we had higher utilization of tax preferenced investments, which increased our operating earnings by $56 million over the prior period. 
  Other  . The prior period included the aforementioned $235 million charge for interest on uncertain tax positions. The prior period also included a $7 million impairment charge on real estate property. These increases were partially offset by $12 million of higher interest on uncertain tax positions and a $7 million decrease in refunds received for favorable outcomes on prior years  tax audits. Additionally, our results include fees earned related to an affiliated reinsurance agreement, which were recorded in other revenues, but were almost entirely offset by related charges in other expenses.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures 
  In this report, the Company presents certain measures of its performance that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. 
  The following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: 
                     Non-GAAP financial measures: 
    Comparable GAAP financial measures: 
      (i) 
    operating revenues 
    (i) 
    revenues 
      (ii) 
    operating expenses 
    (ii) 
    expenses 
      (iii) 
    operating earnings 
    (iii) 
    net income (loss) 

See    Results of Operations  for reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible without unreasonable efforts to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a material impact on net income. 
  Our definitions of the various non-GAAP and other financial measures discussed in this report may differ from those used by other companies: 
  Operating earnings 
  This measure is used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is also our GAAP measure of segment performance. Operating earnings allows analysis of our performance and facilitates comparisons to industry results.  
  Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. 
  Operating revenues and operating expenses 
  These financial measures focus on our primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends, and revenues and costs related to non-core products and divested businesses and certain entities required to be consolidated under GAAP. Also, these measures exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife and are referred to as divested businesses. Operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses). 
  The following additional adjustments are made to revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues: 
             
    Universal life and investment-type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses) and certain variable annuity GMIB fees ( GMIB Fees  and 
                
    Net investment income: (i) includes investment hedge adjustments which represent earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (ii) excludes post-tax operating earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, and (iii) excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) consolidated under GAAP.

     Table of Contents  

The following additional adjustments are made to expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating expenses: 
             
    Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends excludes: (i) changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets, (iii) benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs ( GMIB Costs ), and (iv) market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts ( Market Value Adjustments  
                
    Interest credited to policyholder account balances includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; 
                
    Amortization of DAC and VOBA excludes amounts related to: (i) net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) GMIB Fees and GMIB Costs, and (iii) Market Value Adjustments; 
                
    Interest expense on debt excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP; and 
                
    Other operating expenses excludes costs related to noncontrolling interests and goodwill impairments. 
     The tax impact of the adjustments mentioned are calculated net of the U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate, which could differ from the Company s effective tax rate. 
  The following additional information is relevant to an understanding of our performance results: 
             
    We sometimes refer to sales activity for various products. These sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity. 
                
    Allocated equity is the portion of common stockholders  equity that MetLife s management allocates to each of its segments and sub-segments based on local capital requirements and economic capital. See    Economic Capital.

  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
  There were no changes to the Company s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  The following should be read in conjunction with (i) Part I, Item 3, of the 2015 Annual Report; (ii) Part II, Item 1, of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016; and (iii) Note   12   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I of this report. 
  Asbestos-Related Claims 
  Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is and has been a defendant in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and seek both actual and punitive damages.  
  As reported in the   2015   Annual Report, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company received approximately   3,856   asbestos-related claims in   2015  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Metropolitan Life Insurance Company received approximately   3,267   and   2,971   new asbestos-related claims, respectively. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report for historical information concerning asbestos claims and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s increase in its recorded liability at December 31,   2014  . The number of asbestos cases that may be brought, the aggregate amount of any liability that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company may incur, and the total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain and may vary significantly from year to year.  
  Metropolitan Life Insurance Company reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure from asbestos litigation, including studying its claims experience, reviewing external literature regarding asbestos claims experience in the United States, assessing relevant trends impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous variables that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an overall or per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies of other companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative and judicial developments, the number of pending claims involving serious disease, the number of new claims filed against it and other defendants and the jurisdictions in which claims are pending. Based upon its regular reevaluation of its exposure from asbestos litigation, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has updated its liability analysis for asbestos-related claims through   September 30, 2016  . 
  Unclaimed Property Litigation 
  West Virginia Lawsuits 
  On September 20, 2012, the West Virginia Treasurer filed an action against Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in West Virginia state court   (West Virginia ex rel. John D. Perdue v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, Circuit Court of Putnam County, Civil Action No. 12-C-295)   alleging that Metropolitan Life     Insurance Company violated the West Virginia Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (the  Act ), seeking to     compel compliance with the Act, and seeking payment of unclaimed property, interest, and penalties. On     November 21, 2012 and January 9, 2013, the Treasurer filed substantially identical suits against NELICO and     General American Life Insurance Company  , respectively.   On August 17 2016, these   companies and the West Virginia Treasurer reached an agreement in principle to resolve these actions. 
  Total Control Accounts Litigation 
  Owens v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (N.D. Ga., filed April 17, 2014) 
  Plaintiff filed this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of all persons for whom Metropolitan Life Insurance Company established a retained asset account, known as a total control account ( TCA ), to pay death benefits under an ERISA plan. The action alleges that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s use of the TCA as the settlement option for life insurance benefits under some group life insurance policies violates Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s fiduciary duties under ERISA. As damages, plaintiff seeks disgorgement of profits that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company realized on accounts owned by members of the putative class. On September 27, 2016 the court denied Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s summary judgment motion in full and granted plaintiff s partial summary judgment motion. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously.

Diversified Lending Group Litigations 
  Hartshorne v. MetLife Inc., et al. (Los Angeles County Superior Court, filed March 25, 2015) 
  Plaintiffs have named MetLife, Inc., MetLife Securities, Inc. and NELICO in 12 related lawsuits in California state court alleging various causes of action including multiple negligence and statutory claims relating to a Ponzi scheme involving the Diversified Lending Group. In August 2016, a trial of claims by one of the plaintiffs, Christine Ramirez, resulted in a verdict against MetLife, Inc., MetLife Securities, Inc. and NELICO for approximately   $200 thousand   in compensatory damages and   $15 million   in punitive damages. These companies intend to appeal this verdict. 
  Other Litigation 
  Fauley v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, et al. (Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial Circuit, Lake County, Ill., July 3, 2014) 
  Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against defendants, including Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and a former MetLife financial services representative, alleging that the defendants sent unsolicited fax advertisements to plaintiff and others in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, as amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act, 47 U.S.C.   227. The court issued a final order certifying a nationwide settlement class and approving a settlement under which Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has agreed to pay up to   $23 million   to resolve claims as to fax advertisements sent between August 23, 2008 and August 7, 2014. On March 23, 2016, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the trial court s order. On September 28, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court denied an objector s petition for leave to appeal. 
  Summary 
  Putative or certified class action litigation and other litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in addition to those discussed previously and those otherwise provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of the Company s business, including, but not limited to, in connection with its activities as an insurer, investor and taxpayer. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning the Company s compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. 
  It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. In some of the matters referred to previously, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material effect upon the Company s financial position, based on information currently known by the Company s management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect. However, given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  The following should be read in conjunction with, and supplements and amends, the factors that may affect the Company s business or operations described under  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A, of the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented by the information under  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A, of each of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. Other than as described in this Item 1A, there have been no other material changes to our risk factors from the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented by such information in Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. 
   
  Regulatory and Legal Risks 
  The following updates and replaces the similarly named sections of the risk factor entitled  Our Insurance Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth  included in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented by such information in Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. There have been no material changes to other sections of such risk factor, which include:  Insurance Regulation   U.S. Federal Regulation Affecting Insurance  and  General.  
  Our Insurance Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth 
  Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. See  Business   Regulation  included in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented by discussions of regulatory developments elsewhere herein, and in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Business   Regulatory Developments,  and as further amended or supplemented below. 
  Insurance Regulation 
  ERISA Considerations 
  We provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA or the Code. As such, our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Code, including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and those fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions. The prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to ERISA plans and participants and IRAs if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to the individual advisor, the firm that employs the advisor or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen. Similarly, without an exemption, fiduciary advisors are prohibited from receiving compensation from third parties in connection with their advice. ERISA also affects certain of our in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts as well as insurance policies and annuity contracts we may sell in the future. 
  The DOL issued new regulations on April 6, 2016 with an effective date for most provisions of April 10, 2017. These regulations substantially expand the definition of  investment advice  and thereby broaden the circumstances under which MLIC or its representatives, in providing investment advice with respect to ERISA plans, plan participants or IRAs, will be deemed a fiduciary under ERISA or the Code. Pursuant to the final regulations, certain communications with plans, plan participants and IRA holders, including the marketing of products, and marketing of investment management or advisory services, could be deemed fiduciary investment advice, thus causing increased exposure to fiduciary liability if the distributor does not recommend what is in the client s best interests. While the final regulations also provide that, to a limited extent, contracts sold and advice provided prior to April 10, 2017 do not have to be modified to comply with the new investment advice regulations, there is lack of clarity surrounding some of the conditions for qualifying for this limited exception. There can be no assurance that the DOL will agree with our interpretation of these provisions, in which case the DOL and IRS could assess significant penalties against a portion of products sold prior to April 10, 2017. The assessment of such penalties could also trigger substantial litigation risk. Any such penalties and related litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  
  The DOL also issued amendments to certain of its prohibited transaction exemptions, and issued a new exemption that applies more onerous disclosure and contract requirements to, and increases fiduciary requirements and fiduciary liability exposure in respect of, transactions involving ERISA plans, plan participants and IRAs.  
  
   115 

     Table of Contents  

While we continue to analyze the impact of the final regulations on our business, we believe they could have an adverse effect on sales of annuity products to ERISA qualified plans such as IRAs through our independent distribution partners. The new regulations deem advisors, including independent distributors, who sell fixed index-linked annuities to IRAs, IRA rollovers or 401(k) plans, fiduciaries and prohibit them from receiving compensation unless they comply with a prohibited transaction exemption. The exemption requires advisors to comply with impartial conduct standards and may require us to exercise additional oversight of the sales process. Compliance with the prohibited transaction exemption will likely result in increased regulatory burdens on us and our independent distribution partners, changes to our compensation practices and product offerings and increased litigation risk, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Business   Regulatory Developments   ERISA Considerations,  as well as  Business   Regulation   ERISA Considerations  included in the 2015 Annual Report. 
  We cannot predict what other proposals may be made, what legislation may be introduced or enacted, or what impact any such legislation may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
   
  Operational Risks 
  Any Failure to Protect the Confidentiality of Client Information Could Adversely Affect Our Reputation and Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  Pursuant to U.S. federal and state laws, and laws of other jurisdictions in which MetLife operates, various government agencies have established rules protecting the privacy and security of personal information. In addition, most U.S. states and a number of jurisdictions outside the United States have enacted laws, which vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information. The MetLife employees who conduct our business have access to, and routinely process, personal information of clients through a variety of media, including information technology systems. We rely on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, our company and MetLife employees. It is possible that a MetLife employee could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential client information or our data could be the subject of a cybersecurity attack. If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls or if MetLife employees fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. Such internal control inadequacies or non-compliance could materially damage our reputation or lead to civil or criminal penalties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we analyze customer data to better manage our business. There has been increased scrutiny, including from U.S. state regulators, regarding the use of  big data  techniques such as price optimization. We cannot predict what, if any, actions may be taken with regard to  big data,  but any inquiries could cause reputational harm and any limitations could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
