FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   

Factors that May Affect Future
Results   

(Cautionary Statements Under
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995)   

Certain information included in
this Form 10-Q and other materials filed or to be filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as well as information
included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us or our representatives) contains or may contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
historical or current facts. Statements that include the words  may,   could,   should,   would, 
 believe,   expect,   anticipate,   estimate,   intend,   plan, 
or other words or expressions of similar meaning, may identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking
statements on our current expectations about future events. Forward-looking statements include statements that reflect management s
beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, intentions with respect to the financial condition, results of
operations, future performance and the business of us, including statements relating to our business strategy and our current and
future development plans. These statements may also involve other factors which are detailed in the  Risk Factors 
and other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016 and other filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. 

Although we believe that the assumptions
underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, any or all of the forward-looking statements in this report and in
any other public statements that are made may prove to be incorrect. This may occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions or as
a consequence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed in this report will be important in determining
our future performance. Consequently, actual results may differ materially from those that might be anticipated from forward-looking
statements. In light of these and other uncertainties, you should not regard the inclusion of a forward-looking statement in this
report or other public communications that we might make as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved,
and you should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. 

We undertake no obligation to publicly
update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Any further
disclosures made on related subjects in our subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission should be consulted.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements   

Note 1.     Basis of Presentation     

The interim financial information
included herein is unaudited. However, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of
a normal recurring nature which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly our condensed consolidated balance
sheets at October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended
October 31, 2016 and 2015, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.
Although we believe the disclosures in these financial statements are adequate to make the interim information presented not misleading,
certain information relating to our organization and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted in this Form
10-Q pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules and regulations. These financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2016 and the notes thereto
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. 

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and disclosure
of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, investments, intangible
assets and goodwill, property, plant and equipment, income taxes, employment benefits and contingent liabilities. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Certain reclassifications have
been made to conform prior year financial information to the current period presentation. Those reclassifications did not impact
operating or net income, working capital or stockholders  equity. 

Note 2.     Critical Accounting Policies  

Revenue Recognition     

We record revenues from casino
operations on the accrual basis as earned. The retail value of food and beverage and other services furnished to guests without
charge is included in gross revenue and deducted as promotional allowances. Net revenues do not include the retail amount of food,
beverage and other items provided gratuitously to customers. We record the redemption of coupons and points for cash as a reduction
of revenue as they are earned. These amounts are included in promotional allowances in the accompanying condensed consolidated
statements of operations. The estimated cost of providing such complimentary services included in casino expense in the accompanying
condensed consolidated statements of operations was as follows: 

Fair Value  

U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure
of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three
different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. The three levels are as follows: 

Level 1   Observable inputs
such as quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 

Level 2   Other inputs
that are observable directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable,
either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 

Level 3   Unobservable
inputs for which there is little or no market data and which we make our own assumptions about how market participants would price
the assets and liabilities. 

The following describes the valuation
methodologies used by us to measure fair value: 

Real estate held for sale is
recorded at fair value less selling costs. 

Goodwill and indefinite lived
intangible assets are recorded at carrying value and tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, using projections of discounted
future cash flows. 

Interest rate swaps are adjusted
on a recurring basis pursuant to accounting standards for fair value measurements. We categorize our interest rate swap as Level
2 for fair value measurement. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk  

Financial instruments that potentially
subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily notes receivable, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
payable, and long term debt. Management performs periodic evaluations of the collectability of these notes and accounts receivable.
Our cash deposits are held with large, well-known financial institutions, and, at times, such deposits may be in excess of the
federally insured limit. The recorded value of cash, accounts receivable and payable, approximate fair value based on their short
term nature; the recorded value of long term debt approximates fair value as interest rates approximate current market rates. 

New Accounting Pronouncements
and Legislation Issued   

In February 2016, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued amended accounting guidance that changes the accounting for leases and requires
expanded disclosures about leasing activities. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset
and a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis, at the commencement date for all leases with terms greater than twelve months.
Lessor accounting will remain largely unchanged, other than certain targeted improvements intended to align lessor accounting with
the lessee accounting model and with the updated revenue recognition guidance issued in 2014. Lessees and lessors must apply a
modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative
period presented in the financial statements. The amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim
periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2018, and early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact this guidance will have on its financial position and results of operations. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued
a new accounting standard for revenue recognition which requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods
or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services. The new standard supersedes the existing accounting guidance for revenue recognition, including industry-specific
guidance, and amends certain accounting guidance for recognition of gains and losses on the transfer of non-financial assets. For
public companies, the new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods within those periods) beginning
after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (including
interim periods within those periods). Upon adoption, financial statement issuers may elect to apply the new standard either retrospectively
to each prior reporting period presented, or using a modified retrospective approach by recognizing the cumulative effect of initial
application and providing certain additional disclosures. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2019. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial position and results of operations, and has
not yet determined which adoption method it will elect. 

A variety of proposed or otherwise
potential accounting guidance is currently under study by standard-setting organizations and certain regulatory agencies. Due to
the tentative and preliminary nature of such proposed accounting guidance, the Company has not yet determined the effect, if any,
that the implementation of such proposed accounting guidance would have on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3.     Restricted Cash  

As of October 31, 2016 and April
30, 2016, we maintained $1,518,888 and $1,433,728, respectively, in restricted cash, which consists of player-supported jackpot
funds for our Washington operations. 

Note 4.     Notes
Receivable  

As of October 31, 2016, and April
30, 2016, we had net notes receivable of $628,429 and $1,109,069, respectively. The dates on which payments are collected may vary
depending upon the term of the contracts or note receivable agreements. Interest income related to notes receivable is recorded
when earned and its collectability is reasonably certain. 

G Investments, LLC  

Upon completion of the sale
of the Colorado Grande Casino on May 25, 2012, we recorded a $2,325,000 note receivable. This note bears interest at 6% per annum
through the maturity date of June 1, 2017 and is secured with all of the assets of the Colorado Grande Casino, pledge of membership
interest in G Investments, LLC ( GI ), and a personal guaranty by GI s principal. 

As of October 31,
2016, the remaining principal and interest payments are scheduled to be made as follows: 

Through October 31, 2016, GI has timely made required
principal and interest payments. 

Note 5.     Goodwill and Intangible
Assets  

In connection with our acquisitions
of the Washington mini-casinos on May 12, 2009, July 23, 2010 and July 18, 2011, the South Dakota slot route on January 27, 2012,
and the Club Fortune Casino in Nevada on December 1, 2015, we have goodwill and intangible assets of $22,559,458, net of amortization
for intangible assets with finite lives. 

The change in the carrying amount
of goodwill and other intangible assets for the six months ended October 31, 2016, is as follows:  

Goodwill and net intangibles
assets by segment as of October 31, 2016, are as follows: 

Intangible assets are generally
amortized on a straight line basis over the useful lives of the assets. State gaming registration and trade names are not amortizable.
A summary of intangible assets and accumulated amortization as of October 31, 2016, are as follows: 

The weighted average useful life
of acquired intangibles is 7.0 years for customer relationships and 3.0 years for non-compete agreements. The estimated future
annual amortization of intangible assets, which excludes trade names and state gaming license, is as follows: 

Note 6.     Property and Equipment   

Property and equipment at October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016,
consist of the following: 

Note 7.     Long-Term Debt    

Our long-term financing obligations are as follows: 

On November 30, 2015, the
Company amended its existing credit agreement with Mutual of Omaha Bank to increase the lending commitment to $23 million. 
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ( Credit Facility ) matures on November 30, 2020, and is secured by
liens on substantially all of the real and personal property of the Company and its subsidiaries. The interest rate on the borrowing
is based on LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin, determined quarterly beginning April 1, 2016, based on the total leverage ratio for
the trailing twelve months. The interest rate on the balance as of October 31, 2016, is 3.526%. In addition, the Company was required
to fix the interest rate on at least 50% of the credit facility through a swap agreement. 

As of October 31, 2016, principal
reductions due on the Credit Facility are as follows: 

The unamortized debt discount above
consists of debt costs paid directly to the lender. The discount is amortized over the period of the Credit Facility through interest
expense. 

During the current quarter, we
paid $1.0 million to reduce the outstanding balance of the Credit Facility. As of October 31, 2016, we have $4.9 million available
to borrow per the Credit Agreement. 

The Credit Facility contains
customary covenants for a facility of this nature, including, but not limited to, covenants requiring the preservation and maintenance
of the Company s assets and covenants restricting our ability to merge, transfer ownership, incur additional indebtedness,
encumber assets and make certain investments.  The Credit Facility also contains covenants requiring the Company to maintain
certain financial ratios including a maximum total leverage ratio ranging from 3.00 to 1.00 through January 31, 2017, 2.75 to 1.00
from February 1, 2017 through January 31, 2018, and 2.50 to 1.00 from February 1, 2018 until maturity; and lease adjusted fixed
charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.15 to 1.00. We are in compliance with the covenant requirements of the Credit Facility
as of October 31, 2016. 

Note 8.     Interest Rate Swap  

We are required by the Credit
Facility to have a secured interest rate swap for at least 50% of the Credit Facility commitment. On December 28, 2015, the Company
entered into a swap transaction with Mutual of Omaha Bank ( MOOB ), which has a calculation period as of the tenth
day of each month through the maturity date of the Credit Facility. As of October 31, 2016, the Company had one outstanding interest
rate swap with MOOB with a notional amount of $10,250,000 at a swap rate of 1.77%, which as of October 31, 2016, effectively converts
$10,250,000 of our floating-rate debt to a synthetic fixed rate of 4.27%. Under the terms of the swap agreement, the Company pays
a fixed rate of 1.77% and receives variable rate based on one-month LIBOR as of the first day of each floating-rate calculation
period. Under the International Swap Dealers Association, Inc. ( ISDA ) confirmation, the floating index as of October
31, 2016 is set at 0.529%. 

The Company did not designate
the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and the interest rate swap did not qualify for hedge accounting under ASC Topic 815.
Changes in our interest rate swap fair value are recorded in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Each quarter,
the Company receives fair value statements from the counterparty, MOOB. The fair value of the interest rate swap is determined
using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the derivative.
This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based
inputs, including forward interest rate curves. To comply with the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,
the Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective
counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. As a result of our evaluation of our interest rate swap
as of October 31, 2016, we recorded a $97,176 and $46,462 increase in our interest rate swap fair value for the three and six months
ended October 31, 2016, respectively. As of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, our interest rate swap fair value is a $240,270
liability and $286,731, respectively which is included in other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Note 9.       Equity
Transactions and Stock Option Plans   

We have obligations under two employee
stock plans: (1) the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2009 Plan ), and (2) the 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as
amended (the  2010 Plan ). 

The 2009 Plan  

On April 14, 2009, our shareholders
approved the 2009 Plan providing for the granting of awards to our directors, officers, employees and independent contractors.
The number of common stock shares reserved for issuance under the 2009 Plan is 1,750,000 shares. The 2009 Plan is administered
by the Compensation Committee (the  Committee ) of the Board of Directors. The Committee has complete discretion under
the plan regarding the vesting and service requirements, exercise price and other conditions. Under the 2009 Plan, the Committee
is authorized to grant the following types of awards: 

Stock Options including Incentive Stock Options ( ISO ),   

Options not intended to qualify as ISOs,   

Stock Appreciation Rights, and   

Restricted Stock Grants.   

Our practice has been to issue
new or treasury shares upon the exercise of stock options. Stock option rights granted under the 2009 Plan generally have 5 or
10 year terms and vest in two or three equal annual installments, with some options grants providing for immediate vesting for
a portion of the grant. 

A summary of stock option activity
under our share-based payment plans for the six months ended October 31, 2016 is presented below: 

As of October 31, 2016, there was
no unamortized compensation cost related to stock options. Also, as of October 31, 2016, there was $6,722 of unamortized compensation
cost related to stock grants, which is expected to be recognized over approximately 1.0 year. 

Compensation cost for stock options
granted is based on the fair value of each award, measured by applying the Black-Scholes model on the date of grant and using
the weighted-average assumptions of (i) expected volatility, (ii) expected term, (iii) expected dividend yield, (iv) risk-free
interest rate and (v) forfeiture rate. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock. The expected term considers
the contractual term of the option as well as historical exercise and forfeiture behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based
on the rates in effect on the grant date for U.S. Treasury instruments with maturities matching the relevant expected term of
the award. 

The 2010 Plan  

On October 11, 2010, our shareholders
approved the 2010 Plan which permitted all our eligible employees, including employees of certain of our subsidiaries, to purchase
shares of our common stock through payroll deductions at a purchase price not to be less than 90% of the fair market value of
the shares on each purchase date. There was a total of 500,000 shares available for issuance under the 2010 Plan.  The 2010
Plan had a term of 5 years and expired on January 1, 2016. Therefore, no further stock will be issued under the plan. 

Stock Repurchase Plan  

In July 2016, our board of
directors approved a $2.0 million stock repurchase program to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions from time to time, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, subject to market
conditions, applicable legal requirements, loan covenants and other factors. During the quarter ended October 31, 2016, the
Company repurchased 189,788 shares at a weighted average-price per share of $1.81, costing $351,965, (including commissions and
other related transaction costs). The repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specified number or value of
common stock. 

Note 10.     Computation
of Earnings Per Share   

The following is presented as a
reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted earnings per share computations: 

Note 11.     Commitments
and Contingencies    

We are party to contracts in the
ordinary course of business, including leases for real property and operating leases for equipment. 

The expected remaining future annual
minimum lease payments as of October 31, 2016, are as follows: 

We continue to pursue additional
development opportunities that may require, individually and in the aggregate, significant commitments of capital, extensions of
credit, up-front payments to third parties and guarantees by us of third-party debt. 

We indemnified our officers and
directors for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The
maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited;
however, we have a Directors and Officers Liability Insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion
of any future amounts paid, provided that such insurance policy provides coverage. 

Note 12.     Income Taxes   

For the three months ended October
31, 2016 and 2015, our effective tax rates were 32% and 33%, respectively. For the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015,
our effective tax rates were 31% and 33%, respectively. The difference between the federal statutory rate of 34% and the year
to date s effective tax rate is primarily due to general business credits. 

At October 31, 2016, we have $2.3
million in net deferred tax assets, which is primarily a result of the $7.8 million in receivables that have been fully reserved
for book purposes. We believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized prior to any expiration
and therefore we have not applied a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. 

We filed income tax returns in
the United States federal jurisdiction. No jurisdiction is currently examining our tax filings for any tax years. All of the Company s
tax positions are considered more likely than not to be sustained upon an IRS examination. 

Note 13.     Segment
Reporting    

We have three business segments:
(i) Washington, (ii) South Dakota and (iii) Nevada, as well as the Company s corporate location. For the three months ended
October 31, 2016, the Washington segment consists of the Washington mini-casinos, the South Dakota segment consists of our slot
route operation in South Dakota, Nevada segment consists of Club Fortune casino and the Corporate column includes the vacant land
in Colorado and its taxes and maintenance expenses. The Corporate column also includes corporate-related items, results of insignificant
operations, and income and expenses not allocated to other reportable segments. 

Summarized financial information for our reportable
segments is shown in the following table: 

Item 2.     Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

The following discussion and analysis
( MD A ) should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
contained in our Annual Report for the year ended April 30, 2016, filed on Form 10-K with the SEC on July 29, 2016. 

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of
our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements. We prepare these
financial statements in conformity with GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. On an on-going basis,
we evaluate our estimates; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There
have been no material changes or developments in our evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies
that we believe to be Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates as disclosed in our Annual Report for the year ended April 30,
2016, filed on Form 10-K with the SEC on July 29, 2016. 

Executive Overview   

We were formed in 1977 and, since
1994, have primarily been a gaming company involved in financing, developing, owning and operating gaming properties. Our gaming
facility operations are located in the United States of America ( U.S. ), specifically in the states of Nevada, Washington
and South Dakota. Our business strategy will continue to focus on owning and operating gaming establishments. If we are successful,
our future revenues, costs and profitability can be expected to increase. However, there is no guarantee that we will be successful
in implementing our business strategy in the future and, as such, no guarantee that our future revenues, costs and profitability
will increase. 

Our financial results are dependent
upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those guests spend per visit. Additionally, our operating
results may be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions affecting the disposable income of our guests, weather
conditions affecting our properties, achieving and maintaining cost efficiencies, competitive factors, gaming tax increases and
other regulatory changes, the commencement of new gaming operations and construction at existing facilities. We may experience
significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to seasonality, variations in gaming hold percentages and other
factors. Consequently, our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of
future periods  results. 

COMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTHS
ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2016 AND OCTOBER 31, 2015  

Net revenues . Net revenues
were $18.5 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016, and $16.1 million for the same period ended October 31, 2015.
The increase is due to the inclusion of Club Fortune s $3.1 million of net revenue (Club Fortune was acquired on December
1, 2015), partially offset by net revenue decreases of $0.5 million for the properties in Washington and $0.2 million in South
Dakota. The decrease in Washington s revenues was due to a lower hold percentage impacting Washington revenue by $0.2 million
and reduced poker play. South Dakota revenues were $2.2 million this quarter compared to $2.4 million in the prior year s
quarter primarily due to lower handle as a result of 47 fewer units in operation and the South Dakota market s revenue being
down approximately 8% for the quarter compared to prior year. 

Total operating expenses .
Total operating expenses were $18.3 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016, compared to $15.1 million in the same
period ended October 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to Club Fortune operating expenses, which were $3.4 million. Excluding
Club Fortune s operating expenses, casino expenses decreased $0.2 million when compared to the same period last year primarily
due to lower revenue driven commissions and gaming taxes in South Dakota. Marketing and administration increased $1.0 million
over the prior year period primarily due to Club Fortune. Depreciation and amortization decreased by $0.1 million, excluding Club
Fortune s expenses, because certain Washington customer relationship intangibles are now fully amortized. Food and beverage,
corporate, facility and other expenses remained relatively steady when compared to the same period last year on a same property
basis (excluding the impact of the addition of Club Fortune). 

Non-operating income (expense).
  Total non-operating expense decreased $27 thousand for the three months ended October 31, 2016, compared to the three months
ended October 31, 2015. The decrease resulted primarily from the $0.1 million increase in the swap fair value, partially offset
by the $0.1 million increase in interest expense and amortization of loan issue costs primarily due to the increase in the outstanding
debt since October 31, 2015. 

Income Taxes . For the
three months ended October 31, 2016, our effective tax rate was 32%. For the three months ended October 31, 2015, our effective
income tax rate was 33%. The difference between the federal statutory rate of 34% and the year to date s effective tax rate
is primarily due to general business credits. 

COMPARISON OF THE SIX MONTHS
ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2016 AND OCTOBER 31, 2015   

Net revenues . Net revenues
were $36.8 million for the six months ended October 31, 2016, and $32.1 million for the same period ended October 31, 2015. The
increase is due to the inclusion of Club Fortune s $6.4 million of net revenue (Club Fortune was acquired on December 1,
2015), partially offset by net revenue decreases of $1.2 million for the properties in Washington and $0.4 million in South Dakota.
Washington net revenues decreased $0.9 million after excluding prior year revenue from the Golden Nugget property, which was sold
June 30, 2015. The decrease in Washington s revenue was due to a lower hold percentage and $0.5 million of reduced poker
play. South Dakota revenues were $4.2 million compared to $4.6 million in the prior year s period primarily due to lower
handle as a result of 47 fewer units in operation. 

Total operating expenses .
Total operating expenses were $36.5 million for the six months ended October 31, 2016, compared to $30.3 million in the same period
ended October 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to Club Fortune operating expenses, which were $6.9 million. Excluding
Club Fortune s operating expenses, casino expenses decreased $0.6 million when compared to the same period last year primarily
due to $0.4 million decreases in South Dakota due to lower revenue driven commissions and gaming taxes and $0.2 million in Washington
primarily due to the sale of the Golden Nugget property. Marketing and administration increased $2.1 million over the prior year
period primarily due to Club Fortune. Corporate expense increased $0.2 million after excluding acquisition expenses primarily
due to first quarter professional fees and on-going consulting fees paid to the former owner of Club Fortune. Depreciation and
amortization decreased by $0.2 million, excluding Club Fortune s expenses, because certain Washington customer relationship
intangibles are now fully amortized. Food and beverage, corporate, facility and other expenses remained relatively steady when
compared to the same period last year on a same property basis (excluding the impact of the addition of Club Fortune). 

Non-operating income (expense).
  Total non-operating expense increased $91 thousand for the six months ended October 31, 2016, compared to the six months
ended October 31, 2015. The increase resulted primarily from the $0.1 million increase in interest expense and amortization of
loan issue costs primarily due to the increase in the outstanding debt since October 31, 2015. 

Income Taxes . For the six
months ended October 31, 2016, our effective tax rate was 31%. For the six months ended October 31, 2015, our effective income
tax rate was 33%. The difference between the federal statutory rate of 34% and the current year s effective tax rate is
primarily due to general business credits. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

The term  adjusted EBITDA 
is used by us in presentations, quarterly earnings calls, and other instances as appropriate. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net
income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, change in swap fair value, goodwill and other long-lived asset
impairment charges, write-offs of project development costs, acquisition costs, litigation charges, non-cash stock grants, non-cash
employee stock purchase plan discounts, exclusion of net income or loss from assets held for sale, and net losses/gains from asset
dispositions. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because it is a required component of financial ratios reported by us to our lenders,
and it is also frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties, in addition to and not in lieu
of GAAP results, to compare to the performance of other companies that also publicize this information. 

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement
of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating
performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. 

The following tables show adjusted EBITDA by operating unit: 

Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation to net income: 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Historical Cash Flows   

The following table sets forth
our consolidated net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the six months ended October
31, 2016 and 2015: 

Operating
activities .   Net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended October 31, 2016, decreased by $0.8
million over the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. This lower operating cash flow primarily resulted from the $0.7 million
decrease in operating income before depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on disposal of assets. 

Investing activities .
Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended October 31, 2016, decreased by $0.9 million over the comparable
period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the $1.5 million deposit paid in the prior year towards the Club Fortune acquisition,
partially offset by the current year s $0.5 million increase in purchases of property and equipment. 

Financing activities . Net
cash used in financing activities during the six months ended October 31, 2016, increased $1.4 million over the comparable period
in the prior fiscal year. The increase mainly resulted from the $1.5 million proceeds from the bank loan to finance the Club Fortune
acquisition in the prior fiscal year. 

Future Sources and Uses of Cash  

We expect that our future liquidity and capital requirements
will be affected by: 

-  capital
requirements related to future acquisitions;  

 - cash flow from operations; 

 - new management contracts 

 - working capital requirements; 

 - obtaining debt financing; and 

 - debt service requirements. 

Also, in July 2016, we announced
that our board of directors approved a $2.0 million stock repurchase program to purchase our common stock in the open market or
in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, loan covenants and other factors. During the quarter ended
October 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 189,788 shares for the treasury at a weighted average-price per share of $1.81,
costing $351,965, (including commissions and other related transaction costs). The repurchase plan does not obligate the Company
to acquire any specified number or value of common stock. 

As of October 31, 2016, we have
$4.9 million available to borrow per the Credit Agreement. Principal reductions due on the Credit Facility are as follows: 

On October 31, 2016, excluding
restricted cash of $1,518,888, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10,237,713. The restricted cash consists of funds for player
supported jackpots. 

In November 2016, Washington
state approved increasing the state minimum wage to $11.00 per hour effective January 1, 2017. The minimum wage is scheduled to
increase to $11.50 in 2018, $12.00 in 2019, $13.50 in 2020 and would thereafter be indexed to inflation. The company estimates
the passage of this proposal increases its annualized payroll expense by approximately $1.2 million in the first full year of the
increase. The Company is addressing ways to mitigate the overall financial impact of this potential change. 

Our condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that we will have adequate availability of cash resources to satisfy our liabilities in
the normal course of business. We have made arrangements to ensure that we have sufficient working capital to fund our obligations
as they come due. We believe that funds from operations will provide sufficient working capital for us to meet our obligations
as they come due; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful. Should cash resources not be sufficient to meet
our current obligations as they come due, repay or refinance our long-term debt, and acquire operations that generate positive
cash flow, we would be required to curtail our activities and maintain, or grow, at a pace that cash resources could support. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

None. 

Item 3.     Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

Not required for smaller reporting
companies. 

Item 4.     Controls
and Procedures  

Disclosure controls and procedures   . 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s
rules and forms, and that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Financial
Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In accordance with Rules 13a-15
and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including
our President and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report. As a result of our evaluation, they concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October
31, 2016. 

Changes in internal controls
over financial reporting . On December 1, 2015, the Company acquired Club Fortune casino. Management has assessed the effectiveness
of Club Fortune s internal controls and have determined our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of
October 31, 2016, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
in  Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013 . There have not been any changes in our control over financial reporting during
the three months ended October 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

Part II. Other Information   

Item 1.     Legal
Proceedings   

We are not currently involved in
any material legal proceedings. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

There have been no material changes
in our risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, filed with
the SEC on July 29, 2016. 

Item 2.     Unregistered Sales of Equity
