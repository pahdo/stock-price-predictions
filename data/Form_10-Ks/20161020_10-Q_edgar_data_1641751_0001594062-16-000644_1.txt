Concord, established in 1999, is now one of Canada s largest, independent suppliers of veterinary surgical and dental instruments. Our headquarters are located at 9612 West Hawthorne Crystal River, Florida 34428. 

During August 2015 the Company filed amended articles with the Florida Secretary of State to:

Set a series of preferred stock, each one share being convertible into one share of common stock and with no voting rights; 

-   

Set par value for each of the preferred and common stock at $0.001 per share. 

On July 25, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the State of Florida to increase the authorized Common Stock, par value $0.001, to 8,000,000,000 common shares, and to  effect a forward split of 150 shares for each 1 share of the Company s issued Common Stock ( Forward Split ).  The effective date of the Forward Split is July 28, 2016.  

All share and per share data contained in these financial statements reflects the retroactive application of the aforementioned forward share split. 

To date, our activities have been limited to formation, the raising of equity capital, and the initial stages of implementation of our business plan. We have filed a Form S-1 Registration Statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have received a notice of effect and trade on the OTC Markets, PINK under the symbol VTNL. We are continuing to explore additional sources of capital. We anticipate incurring operating losses as we continue to implement our business plan.

Except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC. The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with those audited financial statements included in Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont d) 

Revenue recognition and related allowances:  Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, which is usually when title passes. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, net of trade discounts and sales taxes. 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:  Accounts receivable are stated at the amount that management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Bad debts and allowances are provided based on historical experience and management s evaluation of outstanding accounts receivable. Management evaluates past due or delinquency of accounts receivable based on the open invoices aged on due date basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is Nil. 

Inventories:  The Company is a reseller of premium veterinary supply products and as such will not maintain inventory as all items are directly drop shipped to customers when ordered and no inventory is held on hand as a result. 

Warranty:  The Company is a reseller of products which are shipped to our customers directly from the manufacturer and as a result, there are no costs that may be incurred by the Company under the terms of the limited warranty provided by the manufacturers directly to the purchasers. We do not provide any provisions for obligations which may arise under manufacturer s warranties and therefore at no time incur any warranty liabilities. 

Advertising and Marketing Costs:  Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and were $nil during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 ($15,000   September 30, 2015) 

Income taxes:  The Company has adopted SFAS No. 109    Accounting for Income Taxes . ASC Topic 740 requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method of ASC Topic 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 

Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share : In accordance with ASC Topic 280    Earnings Per Share , the basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per common share is computed similar to basic loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. 

New Accounting Pronouncements:    

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.  

2.   

GOING CONCERN 

The Company has experienced net losses to date, and it has not generated revenue from operations, we will need additional working capital to service debt and for ongoing operations, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management of the Company has developed a strategy to meet operational shortfalls which may include equity funding, short term or long term financing or debt financing, to enable the Company to reach profitable operations.

This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may", "should", "intends", "expects", "plans", "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "predicts", "potential", or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity or performance to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity or performance expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity or performance. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date that they were made. These cautionary statements should be considered with any written or oral forward-looking statements that we may issue in the future. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results, later events or circumstances or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

In this report unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to  common shares  refer to the common shares of our capital stock. 

The management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). 

As used in this quarterly report, the terms "we", "us", "our", and "our company" means Vet Online Supply, Inc., unless otherwise indicated. 

Corporate Information 

Vet Online Supply, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Florida on May 31, 2014. We are a company that engages in the sale of veterinary supplies for vet clinics of all sizes. We sell our products on the eCommerce web-based platform called OsCommerce, at our website www.vetonlinesupply.com. Our website gives our customers the ability to purchase veterinary supplies at affordable prices, making an order any time of the day, any day of the week. The Company s fiscal year end is December 31.  Our shares are listed for trading on OTC Markets, PINK under the symbol VTNL. 

Other than as set out herein, we have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, along with the accompanying notes.   

At September 30, 2016 we had cash on hand totaling $4,610 (December 31, 2015 - $1,870), total assets of $4,787 (December 31, 2015 - $14,547) and liabilities of $85,557 (December 31, 2015 - $88,377). We must secure additional funds in order to continue our business. We continue to receive advances from our sole officer and director in order to pay expenses related to meeting our public reporting obligations including legal, accounting and filing fees.  While we have raised $35,500 under our Form S-1 Registration Statement, we will need to secure additional financing to fund future filings. To date loans when required have been able to be secured from management of the Company, however we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise additional proceeds or secure additional loans in the future to cover our expenses related to maintaining our reporting company status (estimated at $25,000 for the upcoming 12 months). Furthermore, there is no guarantee we will receive the required financing to complete our business strategies; we cannot provide any assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. If we are unable to accomplish raising adequate funds, then it would be likely that any investment made into the Company would be lost in its entirety.   

Results of Operations 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

We have generated minimal gross profit since inception, and an amount totaling $0 in gross profit during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $19 in gross profit during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, we continue to incur general and administrative costs related to our business plan and the filing requirements as a public reporting issuer. Such general and administrative costs totaled $7,431 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 ($5,494   September 30, 2015). The increase to costs is primarily related to an increase in professional fees associated with our ongoing public reporting requirements and Edgar and XBRL filings. Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $7,562, as compared to $5,475 at September 30, 2015.

For the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

Additionally, we continue to incur general and administrative costs related to our business plan and the filing requirements as a public reporting issuer. Such general and administrative costs totaled $29,968 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 ($106,629   September 30, 2015). The reduction to costs is primarily related to a reduction in legal fees and other professional fees associated with the initial filing of our Registration Statement on Form S-1. Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $29,940, including interest expenses of $324 in the period, as compared to $105,982 at September 30, 2015 with no comparative charges for interest expenses. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the Notes to our Financial Statements, included herein. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 4.             CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of the end of the quarter covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our president and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our president and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Our company is in the process of adopting specific internal control mechanisms to ensure effectiveness as we grow. We have engaged an outside consultant to assist in adopting new measures to improve upon our internal controls. Future controls, among other things, will include more checks and balances and communication strategies between the management and the board, once we are able to secure additional board members, to ensure efficient and effective oversight over company activities as well as more stringent accounting policies to track and update our financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
