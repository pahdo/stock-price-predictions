1   Business Organization, Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation  

BioRestorative
Therapies, Inc. has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Stem Pearls, LLC ( Stem Pearls ) and Stem Cell Cayman Ltd. ( Cayman ),
which was formed in the Cayman Islands (collectively,  BRT  or the  Company ). BRT develops therapeutic
products and medical therapies using cell and tissue protocols, primarily involving adult stem cells. BRT s website is at
 www.biorestorative.com . BRT is currently developing a Disc/Spine Program referred to as  brtxDISC . Its lead
cell therapy candidate, BRTX-100, is a product formulated from autologous (or a person s own) cultured mesenchymal stem
cells collected from the patient s bone marrow. The product is intended to be used for the non-surgical treatment of protruding
and bulging lumbar discs in patients suffering from chronic lumbar disc disease. BRT is also engaging in research efforts with
respect to a platform technology utilizing brown adipose (fat) for therapeutic purposes to treat metabolic disease and has labeled
this initiative its  ThermoStem Program.  Through the program, BRT is developing an allogeneic cell-based therapy
to target type 2 diabetes, obesity and other metabolic disorders using brown adipose (fat) derived stem cells to generate brown
adipose tissue ( BAT ). BAT is intended to mimic naturally occurring brown adipose depots that regulate metabolic
homeostasis in humans. Further, BRT is developing a patented curved needle device that is a needle system to allow access to difficult
to locate regions for the delivery or removal of fluids and other substances. BRT s Stem Pearls brand offers plant stem
cell-based cosmetic skincare products that are available for purchase online at  www.stempearls.com .  

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they
do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. In the opinion of
management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) which are considered necessary
for a fair presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year ending December 31, 2016 or any other
period. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures of the Company as of December 31, 2015 and for the year then ended, which were filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K on March 30, 2016.  

Effective
July 7, 2015, pursuant to authority granted by the stockholders of the Company, the Company implemented a 1-for-20 reverse split
of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock (the  Reverse Split ) and a reduction in the number of
shares of common stock authorized to be issued by the Company from 200,000,000 to 30,000,000. All share and per share information
has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split for all periods presented.  

Note
2   Going Concern and Management s Plans  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency and a stockholders  deficiency of $5,516,672 and $4,471,334,
respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred net losses of $1,833,878 and $6,579,621,
respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company s primary source of operating funds since inception has been equity and debt financings. The Company intends to
continue to raise additional capital through debt and equity financings. There is no assurance that these funds will be sufficient
to enable the Company to fully complete its development activities or attain profitable operations. If the Company is unable to
obtain such additional financing on a timely basis or, notwithstanding any request the Company may make, the Company s debt
holders do not agree to convert their notes into equity or extend the maturity dates of their notes, the Company may have to curtail
its development, marketing and promotional activities, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business,
financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately the Company could be forced to discontinue its operations and liquidate.

Note
2   Going Concern and Management s Plans   Continued   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate
the continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport
to represent realizable or settlement values. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Subsequent
to September 30, 2016, we have received aggregate equity and debt financing of $164,966 and $250,000, respectively, debt and accrued
interest of $50,000 and $2,630, respectively, has been converted or exchanged into common stock and the due date for the repayment
of $437,063 of debt has been extended through October 2017 . As a result, the Company expects to have the cash required to fund
its operations through December 2016. While there can be no assurance that it will be successful, the Company is in active negotiations
to raise additional capital. As of the filing date of this report, the Company has notes payable with an aggregate principal balance
of $137,500 which are past due. The Company is currently in the process of negotiating extensions or discussing conversions to
equity with respect to these notes. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in extending or converting
these notes. See Note 8   Subsequent Events for additional details.  

Note
3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of Cayman and Stem Pearls. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods. The Company s significant estimates and assumptions
include the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair value of the Company s stock, stock-based compensation,
warrants issued in connection with notes payable and the valuation allowance related to the Company s deferred tax assets.
Certain of the Company s estimates, including the carrying amount of the intangible assets, could be affected by external
conditions, including those unique to the Company and general economic conditions. It is reasonably possible that these external
factors could have an effect on the Company s estimates and could cause actual results to differ from those estimates.  

Concentrations
and Credit Risk   

Two
pharmaceutical clients comprised substantially all of the Company s revenue during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015. See Revenue Recognition   Research and Development Agreements below.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Research
and Development Agreements   

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized no revenue related to research and development agreements.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized revenue related to research and development
agreements of $96,122 and $423,588, respectively.

Other   

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $5,000 and $30,000, respectively, of revenue related
to the Company s sublicense agreement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized
$0 and $6,000, respectively, of revenue related to the Company s sublicense agreement.  

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized revenue related to sales of Stem Pearls skincare products
of $0 and $280, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized revenue related
to sales of Stem Pearls skincare products of $0 and $200, respectively.  

Net
Loss Per Common Share   

Basic
loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of vested common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other instruments to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.  

The
following securities are excluded from the calculation of weighted average dilutive common shares because their inclusion would
have been anti-dilutive:  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award.
For employees, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is
generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value
amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually
the vesting period. Since the shares underlying the Company s 2010 Equity Participation Plan (the  Plan ) were
registered on May 27, 2014, the Company estimates the fair value of the awards granted under the Plan based on the market value
of its freely tradable common stock as reported on the OTCQB market. The fair value of the Company s restricted equity instruments
was estimated by management based on observations of the cash sales prices of both restricted shares and freely tradable shares.
Awards granted to directors are treated on the same basis as awards granted to employees.  

Subsequent
Events   

The
Company evaluates events that have occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. Based
upon the evaluation, the Company did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required
adjustment or disclosure in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, except as disclosed.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 requires
an entity to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-09
and its impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ). The amendments in this update clarify the following two aspects to Topic 606:
identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those
areas. The entity first identifies the promised goods or services in the contract and reduces the cost and complexity. An entity
evaluates whether promised goods and services are distinct. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on determining whether
an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property
(which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over
time). ASU 2016-10 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within
that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-10 and its impact on its condensed consolidated financial
statements or disclosures.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and
Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). The new standard will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash
payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017. The Company will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which
case the Company would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently
evaluating ASU 2016-15 and its impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures.  

Note
4   Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities  

Accrued
expenses and other current liabilities are comprised of the following:  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received an aggregate of $127,060 in non-interest bearing advances from
an officer of the Company and made aggregate repayments of $214,090 to an officer and a director of the Company.

5   Notes Payable  

A
summary of the notes payable activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is presented below:  

[1]    As
                                         of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, convertible notes with an aggregate principal
                                         balance of $155,000 and $420,000, respectively, were convertible into shares of common
                                         stock at the election of the Company near maturity. In the event the Company exercised
                                         or exercises that conversion right on a designated portion of such principal balance,
                                         the holder had or has the right to accelerate the conversion of up to $80,000 and $197,500,
                                         respectively, of principal into shares of common stock.    

Related
Party Notes   

On
June 30, 2016, the Company borrowed $500,000 from Tuxis Trust (the  Trust ). A director and principal shareholder
of the Company serves as a trustee of the Trust, which was established for the benefit of his immediate family. The promissory
note evidencing the loan provides for the payment of the principal amount, together with interest at the rate of 10% per annum,
on July 1, 2017. In the event that, prior to maturity, the Company receives net proceeds of $10,000,000 from a single equity or
debt financing (as opposed to a series of related or unrelated financings), the Trust has the right to require that the Company
prepay the amount due under the note (subject to the consent of the party that provided the particular financing). In consideration
of the loan, the Company issued to the Trust a five-year, immediately vested warrant for the purchase of 40,000 shares of common
stock of the Company at an exercise price of $4.00 per share. The $55,659 relative fair value of the warrant has been recorded
as debt discount and will be amortized over the term of the note.  

On
July 1, 2016, the Company repaid the $150,000 outstanding balance of a note held by a lender that is a related party as a result
of having more than 5% beneficial ownership interest in the Company s common stock.  

On
August 5, 2016, the Company issued a six-month note payable with a principal amount of $100,000 which bears interest at a rate
of 10% per annum payable upon maturity to a director of the Company. In connection with the issuance of this promissory note,
the Company issued a five-year, immediately vested warrant to purchase 8,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.00
per share. The $11,959 relative fair value of the warrant has been recorded as debt discount and is being amortized over the term
of the note.

During

Warrant
and Option Valuation   

The
Company has computed the fair value of warrants and options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option forfeitures
are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period. This estimate will be adjusted periodically
based on the extent to which actual option forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate, when it
is material. The Company estimated forfeitures related to option grants at an annual rate ranging from 0% to 5% for options granted
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The expected term used for warrants and options issued to non-employees
is the contractual life and the expected term used for options issued to employees and directors is the estimated period of time
that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The Company utilizes the  simplified  method to develop an estimate
of the expected term of  plain vanilla  employee option grants. The Company is utilizing an expected volatility figure
based on a review of the historical volatilities, over a period of time, equivalent to the expected life of the instrument being
valued, of similarly positioned public companies within its industry. The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied
yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a remaining term consistent with the expected term of the instrument being valued.  

Warrant
Exercises   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 60,831 shares of common stock were exercised at
a reduced exercise price of $3.50 per share (reduced from exercises prices ranging from $4.00 to $15.00 per share) for aggregate
gross proceeds of $212,898. The Company recognized a warrant modification charge of $23,448 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, which represents the incremental value of the modified warrants as compared to the original warrants, both valued as
of the respective modification dates.

technology for adult stem cell treatment of disc and spine conditions, including protruding and bulging lumbar discs. The technology
is an advanced stem cell injection procedure that may offer relief from lower back pain, buttock and leg pain, and numbness and
tingling in the legs and feet. We are also developing our ThermoStem Program. This pre-clinical program involves the use of brown
fat in connection with the cell-based treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity as well as hypertension, other metabolic disorders
and cardiac deficiencies. A United States patent related to the ThermoStem Program was issued in September 2015. 

We are developing a patented
curved needle device that is a needle system to allow access to difficult to locate regions for the delivery or removal of fluids
and other substances. We also offer stem cell derived cosmetic and skin care products. 

Our offices are located
in Melville, New York where we have established a laboratory facility in order to increase our capabilities for the further development
of possible cellular-based treatments, products and protocols, stem cell-related intellectual property and translational research
applications. 

As of September 30, 2016,
our accumulated deficit was $39,903,127, our stockholders  deficiency was $4,471,334 and our working capital deficiency
was $5,516,672. We have historically only generated a modest amount of revenue, our losses have principally been operating expenses
incurred in research and development, marketing and promotional activities in order to commercialize our products and services,
plus general and administrative costs and consulting expenses associated with meeting the requirements of being a public company.
We expect to continue to incur substantial costs for these activities over at least the next year. 

Based
upon our working capital deficiency as of September 30, 2016 and our forecast for continued operating losses, we require equity
and/or debt financing to continue our operations. As of September 30, 2016, our outstanding debt of $1,911,565, together with
interest at rates ranging between 0% and 15% per annum, was due on various dates through April 2017. Subsequent to September 30,
2016 and through November 14, 2016, we have received aggregate equity and debt financing of $164,966 and $250,000, respectively,
debt and accrued interest of $50,000 and $2,630, respectively, has been converted or exchanged into common stock and the due date
for the repayment of $437,063 of debt has been extended through October 2017. Giving effect to the above actions, we currently
have notes payable aggregating $137,500 which are past due. As of November 14, 2016, the outstanding balance of our debt of $2,111,563,
together with accrued interest, was due and payable between on demand and October 2017. Based upon our working capital deficiency
and outstanding debt, we expect that we will have the cash required to fund our operations through December 2016. We anticipate
that we will require between $7,500,000 and $8,500,000 in financing to commence and complete a Phase 2 clinical trial with regard
to our Disc/Spine Program. We anticipate that we will require between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000 in further additional funding
to complete our clinical trials with regard to our Disc/Spine Program. We will also require a substantial amount of additional
funding if we determine to establish a manufacturing operation with regard to our Disc/Spine Program (as opposed to utilizing
a third party manufacturer) and to implement our other programs discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016, including our metabolic ThermoStem Program. The anticipated amounts of
required funding are based on management s estimates, and additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
accomplish our goals within the timeframes projected or that we will be able to obtain any required financing on commercially
reasonable terms or otherwise.  

We are currently considering
several different financing alternatives to support our future operations and are currently in the process of negotiating extensions
or discussing conversions to equity with respect to our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing
on a timely basis or, notwithstanding any request we may make, our debt holders do not agree to convert their notes into equity
or extend the maturity dates of their notes, we may have to curtail our development, marketing and promotional activities, which
would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately we could be
forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate. See  Liquidity and Capital Resources  below. 

Consolidated Results of Operations  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
with Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

The following table presents
selected items in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively: 

Revenues   

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, we generated $5,000 of royalty revenue in connection with our sublicense agreement and $0 of sales of Stem
Pearls skincare products. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, we generated $96,122 of revenues through the services
provided pursuant to our research and development agreements. The decrease in our revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2016 versus 2015 was primarily due to the completion of our obligations under our research and development agreements as of
December 31, 2015 and as of the date of this filing there were no new research and development agreements. 

Cost of sales   

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, cost of sales was $0 as compared to $50,921 for 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, cost
of sales consisted primarily of the portion of employee salary expense, consultant fees, and laboratory supplies expense related
to servicing our research and development agreements. The decrease in our cost of sales for the three months ended September 30,
2016 versus 2015 was due to the completion of our obligations under our research and development agreements during 2015. 

Marketing and promotion

Marketing and promotion
expenses include advertising and promotion, marketing and seminars, meals, entertainment and travel expenses. For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, marketing and promotion expenses decreased by $24,780, or 61%, to $15,632 as compared to $40,412 during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to reduced travel activity and associated costs of approximately
$25,000. 

We expect that marketing
and promotion expenses will increase in the future as we increase our marketing activities following full commercialization of
our products and services. 

Consulting    

Consulting expenses consist
of consulting fees and stock-based compensation to consultants. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, consulting expenses
increased $155,181, or 55%, to $437,717, as compared to $282,536 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
is due to an approximately $105,000 increase in stock-based compensation expense related to options issued to directors and consultants
during 2016 and an approximately $20,000 increase due to the hiring of new consultants. 

Research and development

Research and development
expenses include cash and non-cash compensation of (a) our Chief Executive Officer (in part in 2015); (b) our Vice President of
Research and Development; (c) our Scientific Advisory Board members; (d) our President, Disc/Spine Division; and (e) laboratory
staff and costs related to our brown fat and disc/spine initiatives. Research and development expenses are expensed as they are
incurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, research and development expenses increased by $40,521, or 7%, to $656,169,
as compared to $615,648 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily related to an approximately
$44,000 increase in payroll due to increased headcount and salary raises, partially offset by an approximately $12,000 decrease
in stock-based compensation to employees and advisors. 

We expect that our research
and development expenses will continue to increase with the continuation of the aforementioned initiatives. 

General and administrative

General and administrative
expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, severance costs and stock-based compensation to employees (excluding
any cash or non-cash compensation of (a) our Chief Executive Officer attributable to research and development in part in 2015;
(b) our Vice President of Research and Development; (c) our President, Disc/Spine Division; and (d) our laboratory staff) as well
as corporate support expenses such as legal and professional fees, investor relations and occupancy related expenses. For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses increased by $14,179, or 2%, to $610,694 as compared
to $596,515 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily related to an increase of approximately
$80,000 in stock-based compensation to employees and our Chief Executive Officer, partially offset by a decrease of approximately
$69,000 in professional fees primarily related to our aborted underwritten public offering in 2015. 

We expect that our general
and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we expand our staff, develop our infrastructure and incur additional
costs to support the growth of our business. 

Interest expense   

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, interest expense decreased by $23,218, or 29%, to $57,429 as compared to $80,647 during the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease was due to a reduction in interest-bearing short-term borrowings as compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015. 

Amortization of
debt discount   

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, amortization of debt discount decreased by $1,676, or 5%, to $35,387 as compared to $37,063 during the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of recognition of expense related to the beneficial
conversion features of convertible notes and the recognition of the debt discount expense. 

Loss on extinguishment
of notes payable   

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, loss on extinguishment of notes payable was $25,850, because notes payable were exchanged for equity with
a greater value than the carrying value of the notes payable. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, there were no extinguishments
of notes payable. 

Warrant modification
expense   

For the three months ended
September 30, 2015, we expensed $16,215 related to the modification of outstanding investor warrants. During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, there were no warrant modifications. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

The following table presents
selected items in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively: 

Revenues   

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we generated $30,000 of royalty revenue in connection with our sublicense agreement and $280 of sales of Stem
Pearls skincare products. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we generated $423,588 of revenues through the services
provided pursuant to our research and development agreements, $6,000 of royalty revenue in connection with our sublicense agreement
and $200 from sales of Stem Pearls  skincare products. The decrease in our revenues for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 versus 2015 was primarily due to the completion of our obligations under our research and development agreements as of December
31, 2015 and as of the date of this filing there were no new research and development agreements. 

Cost of sales   

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, cost of sales was $81 as compared to $201,998 for 2015. For the nine months ended September 30 2016, cost
of sales consisted of the costs of the underlying Stem Pearls skincare products. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
cost of sales consisted primarily of the portion of employee salary expense, consultant fees, and laboratory supplies expense
related to our research and development agreements. The decrease in our cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 versus 2015 was due to the completion of our obligations under our research and development agreements during 2015. 

Marketing and promotion    

Marketing and promotion
expenses include advertising and promotion, marketing and seminars, meals, entertainment and travel expenses. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, marketing and promotion expenses decreased by $78,113, or 58%, to $56,327 as compared to $134,440 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to reduced travel activity and associated costs of approximately
$72,000. 

We expect that marketing
and promotion expenses will increase in the future as we increase our marketing activities following full commercialization of
our products and services. 

Consulting    

Consulting expenses consist
of consulting fees and stock-based compensation to consultants. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, consulting expenses
increased $485,934, or 62%, to $1,272,530 as compared to $786,596 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
is due to an approximately $478,000 increase in consultant stock-based compensation expense related to options granted to directors
and consultants during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Research and development

Research and development
expenses include cash and stock-based compensation of (a) our Chief Executive Officer (in part during 2015); (b) our Vice President
of Research and Development; (c) our Scientific Advisory Board members; (d) our President, Disc/Spine Division; and (e) laboratory
staff and costs related to our brown fat and disc/spine initiatives. Research and development expenses are expensed as they are
incurred. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, research and development expenses increased by $655,909, or 44%, to $2,130,901
as compared to $1,474,992 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily related to an approximately
$380,000 increase in payroll due to salary raises and cash bonuses and an approximately $208,000 increase in costs related to
a third party laboratory associated with our disc/spine initiative, partially offset by an approximately $108,000 decrease due
to our Chief Executive Officer no longer devoting time to research and development. 

We expect that our research
and development expenses will increase with the continuation of the aforementioned initiatives. 

General and administrative

General and administrative
expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, severance costs and stock-based compensation to employees (excluding
any cash or non-cash compensation of (a) our Chief Executive Officer attributable to research and development in part in 2015;
(b) our Vice President of Research and Development; (c) our President, Disc/Spine Division; and (d) our laboratory staff) as well
as corporate support expenses such as legal and professional fees, investor relations and occupancy related expenses. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses increased by $285,491, or 13%, to $2,495,933 as compared
to $2,210,442 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily related to an increase of approximately
$540,000 in stock-based compensation to employees and our Chief Executive Officer, partially offset by a decrease of approximately
$281,000 in professional legal fees primarily related to a legal settlement and our aborted underwritten public offering in 2015. 

We expect that our general
and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we expand our staff, develop our infrastructure and incur additional
costs to support the growth of our business. 

Interest expense   

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, interest expense decreased by $60,106, or 29%, to $145,277 as compared to $205,383 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was due to a reduction in interest-bearing short-term borrowings as compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Amortization of
debt discount   

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, amortization of debt discount increased by $259,909, or 146%, to $437,856 as compared to $177,947 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the timing of the recognition of expense related to the
beneficial conversion features of convertible notes and the recognition of the debt discount expense. 

Loss on extinguishment of notes payable   

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, loss on extinguishment of notes payable increased by $16,481, or 63%, to $42,510 as compared to $26,029 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the differential in the value of equity
securities exchanged for notes payable. 

Warrant modification
expense   

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we recorded expense of $28,486 related to the modification of the exercise prices and expiration dates
of certain outstanding warrants. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we expensed $16,215 related to the modification
of outstanding investor warrants. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity  

We measure our liquidity
in a number of ways, including the following: 

Availability of Additional
Funds  

Based upon our working
capital deficiency and stockholders  deficiency of $5,516,672 and $4,471,334, respectively, as of September 30, 2016, we
require additional equity and/or debt financing to continue our operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern. 

As
of September 30, 2016, our outstanding debt of $1,911,565, together with interest at rates ranging between 0% and 15% per annum,
was due on various dates through April 2017. Subsequent to September 30, 2016 and through November 14, 2016, we have received
aggregate equity and debt financing of $164,966 and $250,000, respectively, debt and accrued interest of $50,000 and $2,630, respectively,
has been converted or exchanged into common stock and the due date for the repayment of $437,063 of debt has been extended through
October 2017. Giving effect to the above actions, we currently have notes payable aggregating $137,500 which are past due. As
of the date of filing, our outstanding debt was as follows:  

Based upon our working
capital deficiency, outstanding debt and forecast for continued operating losses, we expect that we will have the cash required
to fund our operations through December 2016. Thereafter, we will need to raise further capital, through the sale of additional
equity or debt securities, to support our future operations and to repay our debt (unless, if requested, the debt holders agree
to convert their notes into equity or extend the maturity dates of their notes). Our operating needs include the planned costs
to operate our business, including amounts required to fund contemplated clinical trials, working capital and capital expenditures.
Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including our ability to
successfully commercialize our products and services, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into
collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service
offerings. 

We may be unable to raise
sufficient additional capital when we need it or raise capital on favorable terms. Debt financing may require us to pledge certain
assets and enter into covenants that could restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness,
and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable
terms, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations or obtain funds by entering into financing agreements
on unattractive terms. 

Our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern
and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values.
The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our sources and uses of cash were as follows: 

Net Cash Used in Operating
Activities  

We experienced negative
cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 in the amounts of $3,941,038 and $2,068,004,
respectively. The net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to cash
used to fund a net loss of $6,579,621, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $2,583,513, plus $55,071 of cash
provided by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of an increase in accrued interest,
expenses and other current liabilities and a decrease in accounts receivables, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable.
The net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to cash used to fund
a net loss of $4,804,254, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $1,354,756, partially offset by $1,381,494
of cash provided by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of increases in accrued interest,
expenses and other current liabilities, plus accounts payable. 

Net Cash Used in Investing
Activities  

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $181,942, due to cash used for the purchase of furniture,
computer equipment and medical equipment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, $360,466 of cash was used to purchase
fixed assets and $75,000 was used to retain the exclusivity of our disc/spine license. 

Net Cash Provided by
Financing Activities  

Net cash provided by financing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3,962,740 and $2,424,465, respectively. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, $831,470 of net proceeds were from debt financings and other borrowings and $3,131,270 of proceeds
were from equity financings (including proceeds received in connection with the exercise of common stock purchase warrants). During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, $1,063,465 of net proceeds were from debt financings and $1,361,000 of proceeds were
from equity financings. 

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates  

There are no material
changes from the critical accounting policies set forth in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations  of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. Please
refer to that document for disclosures regarding the critical accounting policies related to our business. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

None. 

Item 3: Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4: Controls and
Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Disclosure controls are
procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are
also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
the Principal Executive and Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal
controls are procedures which are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions are
properly authorized, recorded and reported; and (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use, to permit
the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted
accounting principles. 

In connection with the
preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, management, with the participation
of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive
and Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Controls  

There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the quarter ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations of the Effectiveness of Control  

A control system, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

Not applicable. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Not applicable. See, however,
Item 7 ( Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Factors That May
Affect Future Results and Financial Condition ) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015,
filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. 

Item 2. Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, we issued the following securities in transactions not involving any public offering. For each of the
following transactions, we relied upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Act ), as transactions
by an issuer not involving any public offering or Section 3(a)(9) of the Act as a security exchanged by an issuer with its existing
security holders exclusively where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting
such exchange. For each such transaction, we did not use general solicitation or advertising to market the securities, the securities
were offered to a limited number of persons, the investors had access to information regarding us (including information filed
with the SEC contained in Current Reports on Form 8-K , our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 (for issuances after the August 15, 2016 filing date)
and press releases made by us), and we were available to answer questions from prospective investors. We reasonably believe that
each of the investors is an accredited investor. The proceeds were used to reduce our working capital deficit. 

(1)  
      The
    value of the non-cash consideration was estimated to be the fair value of our restricted common stock. Since our shares are
    thinly traded in the open market, the fair value of our equity instruments was estimated by management based on observations
    of the cash sales prices of both restricted shares and freely tradable shares.

    and   

(b)  
      Any fraud, whether
    or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal
