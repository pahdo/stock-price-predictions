CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION   
   
  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include our statements regarding our goals, beliefs, strategies, objectives, plans, including product and service developments, future financial conditions, results or projections or current expectations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential" or "continue," the negative of such terms, or other comparable terminology. For example, when we discuss the size of the digital marketing market, our expectations that our revenues and cost of revenues will increase in 2016, our expansion plans, our new products, our intentions to grow revenues by investing in sales and marketing efforts, our spending on research and development, training, and support personnel, we are using forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, economic, political and market conditions and fluctuations, government and industry regulation, interest rate risk, U.S. and global competition, and other factors. Most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond our control. You should consider the areas of risk described in connection with any forward-looking statements that may be made herein. The business and operations of Accelerize Inc. are subject to substantial risks, which increase the uncertainty inherent in the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to release publicly the result of any revision to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Further information on potential factors that could affect our business is described under  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on March 17, 2016. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures we have made in this report and in our annual report on Form 10-K.

   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     
     
          NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS    
     
  Accelerize Inc., a Delaware corporation, incorporated on November 22, 2005, owns and operates CAKE, a Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, platform providing online tracking and analytics solutions for advertisers and online marketers.  
     
  The Company provides software solutions for businesses interested in expanding their online advertising spend.  
     
  The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, have been omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, but we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included herein should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 17, 2016.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal, recurring adjustments and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of these interim statements have been included. The results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year ending December 31, 2016.  
     
   Principles of Consolidation   
     
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of Cake Marketing UK Ltd., or the Subsidiary. All material intercompany accounts and transactions between the Company and the Subsidiary have been eliminated in consolidation.  

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
   Use of Estimates   
     
  The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reporting amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results will differ from those estimates. Included in these estimates are assumptions about collection of accounts receivable, useful life of fixed assets and intangible assets, and assumptions used in Black-Scholes-Merton, or BSM, valuation methods, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend rate.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents   
   
  The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The Company has restricted cash as a result of its corporate card program through its bank. The bank requires a collateral which is placed in a money market account and can be increased or decreased at any time at the discretion of the Company. The Company s restricted cash amounted to $200,000 at September 30, 2016.   

5

Accounts Receivable   
     
  The Company s accounts receivable are due primarily from advertisers and marketers. Collateral is currently not required. The Company also maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company s customers to make payments. The Company periodically reviews these estimated allowances, including an analysis of the customers  payment history and creditworthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to make payments as well as historical collection trends for its customers as a whole. Based on this review, the Company specifically reserves for those accounts deemed uncollectible or likely to become uncollectible. When receivables are determined to be uncollectible, principal amounts of such receivables outstanding are deducted from the allowance.    

Concentration of Credit Risks   
     
  The Company is subject to concentrations of credit risk primarily from cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.  
     
  The Company s cash and cash equivalents accounts are held at a financial institution and are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, up to $250,000. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company has reached bank balances exceeding the FDIC insurance limit. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, the Company periodically evaluates the credit quality of the financial institution in which it holds deposits.  
     
  The Company's accounts receivable are due from customers, generally located in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Canada. None of the Company s customers accounted for more than 10% of its accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  The Company does not require any collateral from its customers.  
     
    Revenue Recognition   
     
  The Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.  
     
  The Company s SaaS revenues are generated from implementation and training fees and a monthly license fee, supplemented by per transaction fees paid by customers for monthly platform usage. The initial term of the customer contract is generally one year with one of two general cancellation policies. Each party may cancel the contract within the initial period or after the initial period, with 30-days  prior notice. The Company does not provide any general right of return for its delivered items. Services associated with the implementation and training fees have standalone value to the Company s customers, as there are third-party vendors who offer similar services to the Company s services. Accordingly, they qualify as separate units of accounting. The Company allocates a fair value to each element deliverable at the recognition date and recognizes such value when the services are provided. The Company bases the fair value of the implementation and training fees on third-party evidence and the monthly license fee on vendor-specific objective evidence. Fees charged by third-party vendors for implementation and training services do not vary significantly from the fees charged by the Company. Services associated with implementation and training fees are generally rendered within a month from the initial contract date. The value attributed to the monthly license fees as well as the fees associated with monthly transaction-based platform usage are recognized in the corresponding period.  
     
   Product Concentration   
     
  The Company generates its revenues from software licensing, usage, and related transaction fees.  

6

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
     
  The Company accounts for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.   
     
  ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:  

Level 1:    
 
  Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.    

Level 2:    
 
  Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.    

Level 3:    
 
  Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity s own assumptions.     
     
    Additional Disclosures Regarding Fair Value Measurements   
     
  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and lines of credit approximate their fair value due to the short term maturity of these items.  

Advertising   
     
  The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.  

Income Taxes   
     
  Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized, but no less than quarterly.  
     
   Foreign Currency Translation   
     
  The Company s reporting currency is U.S. Dollars. The functional currency of the Company s Subsidiary in the United Kingdom is British Pounds. The translation from British Pounds to U.S. Dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using the average exchange rate in effect during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from exchange rate fluctuation on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Software Development Costs   
     
  Costs incurred in the research and development of software products and significant upgrades and enhancements thereto during the preliminary project stage and the post-implementation operation stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for maintenance and relatively minor upgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with the application development stage of new software products and significant upgrades and enhancements thereto are capitalized when 1) management implicitly or explicitly authorizes and commits to funding a software project and 2) it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. The Company capitalized internal-use software development costs of $1,606,887 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company amortizes such costs once the new software products and significant upgrades and enhancements are completed. The unamortized internal-use software development costs amounted to $2,584,007 and $1,548,085 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company s amortization expenses associated with capitalized software development costs amounted to $195,387 and $570,966 during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $200,133 and $539,265 during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Amortization of internal-use software is reflected in cost of revenues.  
     
   Share-Based Payment   
     
  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this topic, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period.  
     
  The Company has elected to use the BSM option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its options, which incorporates various subjective assumptions including volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividend yield to calculate the fair value of stock option awards. Compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  
     
   Segment Reporting   
     
  The Company generated revenues from one source, its SaaS business, during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company's chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of the Company based upon revenues and expenses by functional areas as disclosed in the Company's statements of operations.  
     
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  The Company applied ASU 2015-03: Interest   Imputation of Interest, which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs, and netted debt issue costs previously reported as assets with the related liability for presentation purposes. Other accounting pronouncements have been issued but deemed by management to be outside the scope of relevance to the Company.    
     
   Reclassification   
     
  The balance sheet, and related footnotes, for the year ended December 31, 2015 has been reclassified to reflect the adoption of ASU 2015-03 which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements and requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset.

Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share   
     
  Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing income available to stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants (calculated using the modified-treasury stock method).  

Property and Equipment   
     
  Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.  
      
  Property and equipment consist of the following at:  

During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold approximately $15,000 in computer equipment with a net book value of approximately $6,000 for proceeds of approximately $6,000.   
     
  During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company wrote off approximately $280,000 in fixed assets with a net book value of approximately $31,000, which was recorded under the depreciation expense account.  

NOTE 3: PREPAID EXPENSES   
     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s prepaid expenses consisted primarily of prepaid insurance and rent.  

9

NOTE 4: DEFERRED REVENUES   
     
  The Company s deferred revenues consist of prepayments made by certain of the Company s customers.  The Company decreases the deferred revenues by the amount of the services it renders to such clients when provided.  

NOTE 5: LINE OF CREDIT AND LOANS   
     
   Line of Credit   

On September 30, 2014, the Company entered into an amendment of its line of credit, or the Line of Credit, with Pacific Western Bank, as successor in interest by merger to Square 1 Bank, or the Lender, to borrow up to a maximum of $6,000,000 at the Company s discretion, an increase from up to $3,000,000 that the Company was permitted to borrow under the original Line of Credit entered into on March 17, 2014. Amounts borrowed accrued interest at the prime rate in effect from time to time plus 1.25%, not to be less than 5.5% per annum, provided that in no event shall the accrued interest payable with respect to any month be less than $10,000. Accrued interest on amounts borrowed was payable monthly. All other amounts borrowed were to be payable in full on the maturity date of March 17, 2016; however, this date was extended by the Lender until May 31, 2016. This maturity extension was granted concurrently with a waiver issued by the Lender pursuant to an amendment to the Line of Credit on March 11, 2016, which amendment waived any default due to breach of the Line of Credit minimum liquidity covenant during the specified time period, adjusts the Minimum Adjusted EBITDA covenant, and reduces the credit limit to $5,135,000. A condition precedent to the waiver was the funding of a $625,000 subordinated loan, or the Agility Loan, from Agility Capital II, LLC, or Agility Capital, which funded on March 11, 2016. The Line of Credit may be earlier terminated without a prepayment fee. The Company also made a repayment of $62,777 in March 2016.  
     
  In connection with the original Line of Credit, the Company issued to the Lender a warrant to purchase up to 46,875 shares of the Company s Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.60 per share. The warrant expires on March 17, 2017. The fair value of the warrant amounted to $32,067. On March 27, 2015, in connection with an obligation under the Line of Credit when borrowings thereunder exceed $3,000,000, the Company issued to the Lender a warrant to purchase 58,824 shares of the Company s Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.53 per share. This warrant expires on March 27, 2018. The fair value of the warrant amounted to $37,289.   
     
  As further described below, on May 5, 2016, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement, or the SaaS Capital Loan, with SaaS Capital Funding II, LLC to borrow up to a maximum of $8,000,000. On May 5, 2016, the Company drew down $5,000,000 as the initial advance from the SaaS Capital Loan and used a portion of the proceeds, $4,572,223, to repay the outstanding Line of Credit balance.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no outstanding balance under the Line of Credit.   

10

The Company paid approximately $50,000 to the Lender in financing costs through December 31, 2015, and approximately $69,000 through May 5, 2016. The deferred financing costs associated with the Line of Credit were fully expensed at June 30, 2016.  
     
   Agility Loan    

On March 11, 2016, the Company entered into a subordinated loan with Agility Capital which provides for total availability of $625,000 and matures on March 31, 2017. The Agility Loan has a fixed interest rate of 12% per year and requires $25,000 monthly amortization payments beginning on June 1, 2016. The Agility Loan also requires fees of approximately $130,000 over the life of the loan, and is subject to a total aggregate minimum interest of $50,000 in the event of a prepayment. The Agility Loan contains covenants to achieve specified Adjusted EBITDA levels, as defined, limiting capital expenditures, restricting the Company s ability to pay dividends, purchase and sell assets outside the ordinary course and incur additional indebtedness. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. The Agility Loan requires a security interest in all of the Company s personal property and intellectual property, second in priority to the Lender and to SaaS Capital Funding II, LLC.  
     
  In connection with the Agility Loan, Agility Capital is entitled to purchase, under certain circumstances, fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Company s class of securities, or Shares, at the initial exercise price per Share which is the closing price on the day prior to the issuance date, or the Warrant Price.

  The fair value of the warrants granted during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 is based on the BSM model using the following assumptions:  

During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded expenses of $125,867 and $680,467, respectively, related to warrants granted to employees.

The individuals who are eligible to receive option grants under the Plan are employees, directors and other individuals who render services to the management, operation or development of the Company or its subsidiaries and who have contributed or may be expected to contribute to the success of the Company or a subsidiary. Every option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written stock option agreement in such form as the Board shall approve from time to time, specifying the number of shares of Common Stock that may be purchased pursuant to the option, the time or times at which the option shall become exercisable in whole or in part, whether the option is intended to be an incentive stock option or a non-incentive stock option, and such other terms and conditions as the Board shall approve.  

13

The share-based payment is based on the fair value of the outstanding options amortized over the requisite period of service for option holders, which is generally the vesting period of the options. The fair value of the options granted during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is based on the BSM model using the following assumptions:  

The Company generally recognizes its share-based payment over the vesting terms of the underlying options.  

The total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized amounted to $578,923 at September 30, 2016 and the Company expects that it will be recognized over the following weighted-average period of 48 months.  
     
  If any options granted under the Plan expire or terminate without having been exercised or cease to be exercisable, such options will be available again under the Plan. All employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to receive incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. Non-employee directors and outside consultants who provided bona-fide services not in connection with the offer or sale of securities in a capital raising transaction are eligible to receive non-qualified stock options. Incentive stock options may not be granted below their fair market value at the time of grant or, if to an individual who beneficially owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all stock classes of the Company or a subsidiary, the option price may not be less than 110% of the fair value of the Common Stock at the time of grant. The expiration date of an incentive stock option may not be longer than ten years from the date of grant. Option holders, or their representatives, may exercise their vested options up to three months after their employment termination or one year after their death or permanent and total disability.

ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   
     
   The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain statements in this discussion and elsewhere in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information  elsewhere in this report. Because this discussion involves risk and uncertainties, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.   
     
   Overview      
      
  We own and operate CAKE, a marketing technology company that provides a comprehensive suite of innovative marketing intelligence solutions. Our powerful SaaS enterprise platform delivers a new approach to digital marketing, realized by advancements in our technology, that enables organizations to achieve a precise, data-driven view of their multi-channel digital marketing spend. An industry standard for advertisers, networks, publishers, and agencies to measurably improve and optimize campaign performance, CAKE has over 500 customers driving billions of consumer actions monthly through its system.  
     
  Digital marketing spending worldwide is expected to increase from $200.8 billion in 2015 to $306 billion in 2020, according to a Technavio report issued on July 26, 2016. Additionally, an October 24, 2016 Gartner study reports that marketing budgets continue their steady ascent in 2016, climbing to 12% of company revenue. CAKE is poised to be a foundation of success and a catalyst for innovation in the growing marketing industry. Through its multi-channel digital marketing hub, CAKE continues to deliver new technology that reveals granular data from the source, and at any scale.  
     
  CAKE recently accomplished a significant intellectual property milestone with the filing of a provisional patent application, on September 12, 2016, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office covering technology of an algorithmic attribution analytics server and method. The method determines publishing channels for advertisements in a marketing campaign to analyze their marketing effectiveness for purchasable items. This is accomplished by using a processor and memory of the attribution server. The attribution server computes attribution scores associated with the publishing channels based on the attribution models and the optimal model parameters from regressions. The attribution scores are then communicated to a marketer client through a network upon a request.   
     
  Our revenue model is based on a monthly license fee, a usage fee (based on volume of clicks, impressions, or leads), a training and implementation fee, and in certain cases, professional services fees and royalties. Clients purchase annual or monthly subscriptions with an additional usage fee. A majority of our revenue is derived from clients in the United States but we have seen a 14% growth in our client base outside of the United States during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  
     
  Our training, support personnel, hosting and cloud-based infrastructure contribute to our cost of operating the business. We anticipate more spending in these areas while we continue to grow and could foresee some savings in infrastructure cost due to economies of scale. However, we want to continue to invest in these areas to support our growth. 

We experienced 12% year-over-year growth in revenue during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. We experienced a 28% year-over-year growth in monthly license fee revenue during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. The organic growth has been a result of providing the marketing technology industry a comprehensive suite of marketing intelligence tools through innovation and what we believe to be a superior product and customer experience.   
     
  We allocated a portion of our marketing budget to establish a strong presence at tradeshows, implement demand generation campaigns for customer acquisition and retention, and provide support documentation required by sales initiatives. Additional efforts will be made to speak at industry events and secure coverage in industry publications, increasing awareness of the CAKE suite of products and the thought leadership driving product development.     

Our principal offices are located at 20411 SW Birch Street, Suite 250, Newport Beach, CA 92660. Our telephone number there is: (949) 548-2253. Our corporate website is: www.accelerize.com, the contents of which are not part of this quarterly report.

Discussion of Results for Three-Month and Nine-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
       
   Revenues   

We generate revenues from a monthly license fee, a usage fee (based on volume of clicks, impressions, or leads), a training and implementation fee, and in certain cases, professional services fees, and royalties. Our revenue breakdown for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows.  

The increases in our software licensing revenues during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the prior year periods, is due to the increased number of customers using our SaaS products and services, as well as increased monthly revenues from our existing customers resulting from greater adoption and higher usage of our SaaS platform. Our monthly license fee revenue, which constitutes the contractually recurring portion of our revenue and comprises the bulk of our total revenue, or 76% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, increased approximately 28% year over year during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. Our professional service fees, which make up the bulk of other revenue, decreased as a result of a concerted focus on increasing our contractually recurring portion of revenue. Our third quarter revenue this year was negatively impacted by approximately $250,000 as a result of our decision to discontinue servicing certain low quality emailing businesses late in the second quarter. Our average monthly revenue per customer increased 11% and 9% during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, when compared to the prior year periods. The increases in the number of customers using our SaaS products and services during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to the increased resources we have devoted to customer acquisition for our SaaS products. The higher average monthly revenues from our existing customers is primarily due to higher market acceptance and adoption among our users, resulting in a higher volume of transactions.   
         
  We believe that our SaaS revenues will continue to increase during the remainder of 2016 when compared to 2015.  
     
   Cost of Revenues   

Cost of revenues consists primarily of web hosting and personnel costs associated with supporting customer on-boarding and training activities, including salaries, benefits, and related infrastructure costs. Web hosting fees are partially correlated to our revenues, depending on each specific agreement we have with our clients. The majority of our clients  services are hosted on non-dedicated servers, on which capacity can be maximized by server, while certain customers prefer to have their services hosted on dedicated servers, on which capacity can only be maximized by customer and by server. Additionally, our resources associated with on-boarding are usually allocated at the beginning of the relationship with the new customer (usually, the first two months). Accordingly, our personnel costs associated with supporting customer on-boarding activities are not necessarily correlated with our revenues.  
     
  During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the prior year periods, cost of revenues significantly increased reflecting the higher web hosting fees incurred to support our increased number of clients and platform usage, which increased during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 by approximately $310,000 and $1,140,000, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015.  

We believe that our cost of revenues will continue to increase during the remainder of 2016, when compared to 2015.   

18

Research and Development Expenses   

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with the enhancement and maintenance of our SaaS product offerings, consisting of salaries, benefits, and related infrastructure costs, offset by capitalized software development costs.    
     
  Our research and development expenses decreased during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the prior year periods, mainly due to increased capitalization of software development costs which amounted to $576,431 and $1,606,887 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively.   
     
  We believe that our research and development expenses will increase gradually during the remainder of 2016 at lower levels than the prior year, as we continue to enhance the features of our SaaS platform.   

Sales and Marketing Expenses   

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with the sale and marketing of our SaaS products, including salaries, benefits, and related infrastructure, as well as the costs of related marketing programs, such as trade shows and public relations.  
     
  The decreases in sales and marketing expenses during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the prior year periods, are primarily due to more efficient spending in specific, higher return, marketing programs and trade shows, as well as a reduction in personnel costs in both the marketing and sales departments.  
   
  We believe that our sales and marketing expenses will increase slightly during the remainder of 2016 at substantially lower levels than the prior year, as we continue to execute on proven marketing programs.   
        
   General and Administrative Expenses   

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs associated with the support of our operations consisting of salaries, benefits, and related infrastructure. Also included are non-personnel costs, such as audit fees, accounting services and legal fees, as well as professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses such as investor relations.  
     
  The decreases in general and administrative expenses during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the prior year periods, are primarily due to the reduction in personnel.  
     
  We believe that our general and administrative expenses will increase during the remainder of 2016 at lower levels than the prior year, as we continue to increase the scope of our operations.   

19

Other Income   

Other income during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 consisted mainly of the sale of non-inventory assets and credit card program cash back payments while during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, some non-inventory assets were sold at a small loss. During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, other income consisted of the sale of non-inventory assets as well as rent from a sublease of our Santa Monica office space.     

Other Expenses   

Other expenses consist of interest charges and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our loans.  
     
  The increases in interest expenses during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the prior year periods, are primarily due to higher levels of borrowings we have made from time to time under the Line of Credit and debt issue costs related to the Agility and SaaS Capital Loans. Our interest expense may change during the remainder of 2016 depending on our liquidity needs and we may choose to further finance our working capital needs through our operations, from borrowings, or by issuing securities.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

At September 30, 2016 and 2015, 48% and 56%, respectively, of our total assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.  
     
  We extend unsecured credit in the normal course of business to our customers. The determination of the appropriate amount of the reserve for uncollectible accounts is based upon a review of the amount of credit extended, the length of time each receivable has been outstanding, and the specific customers from whom the receivables are due.  
     
  The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have ready access to sufficient funds to meet commitments while implementing our growth strategy. Our primary sources of liquidity historically include the sale of our securities and borrowings from our Line of Credit.  
     
  We do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures of tangible items.  

20

Line of Credit    
     
  On September 30, 2014, we entered into an amendment of our Line of Credit to borrow up to a maximum of $6,000,000 at our discretion, an increase from up to $3,000,000 that we were permitted to borrow under the original Line of Credit entered into on March 17, 2014. Amounts borrowed accrued interest at the prime rate in effect from time to time plus 1.25%, not to be less than 5.5% per annum, provided that in no event shall the accrued interest payable with respect to any month be less than $10,000. Accrued interest on amounts borrowed was payable monthly. All other amounts borrowed were to be payable in full on the maturity date of March 17, 2016; however, this date was extended by the Lender until May 31, 2016. This maturity extension was granted concurrently with a waiver issued by the Lender pursuant to an amendment to the Line of Credit on March 11, 2016, which amendment waives any default due to breach of the Line of Credit minimum liquidity covenant during the specified time period, adjusts the Minimum Adjusted EBITDA covenant, and reduces the credit limit to $5,135,000. A condition precedent to the waiver was the funding of the $625,000 subordinated loan from Agility Capital, which funded on March 11, 2016. The Line of Credit may be earlier terminated without a prepayment fee.  
     
  In connection with the original Line of Credit, we issued to the Lender a warrant to purchase up to 46,875 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.60 per share. The warrant expires on March 17, 2017. The fair value of the warrant amounted to $32,067. On March 27, 2015, in connection with an obligation under the Line of Credit when borrowings thereunder exceed $3,000,000, we issued to the Lender a warrant to purchase 58,824 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.53 per share. This warrant expires on March 27, 2018.    
     
  On May 5, 2016, we repaid the outstanding Line of Credit balance with the initial advance from our SaaS Capital Loan, which became effective on May 5, 2016.    
     
   Agility Loan   
     
  On March 11, 2016, we entered into a subordinated loan with Agility Capital which provides for total availability of $625,000 and matures on March 31, 2017. The Agility Loan has a fixed interest rate of 12% per year and requires $25,000 monthly amortization payments beginning on June 1, 2016. The Agility Loan also requires fees of approximately $130,000 over the life of the loan, and is subject to a total aggregate minimum interest of $50,000 in the event of a prepayment. The Agility Loan contains covenants to achieve specified Adjusted EBITDA levels, as defined, limiting capital expenditures, restricting our ability to pay dividends, purchase and sell assets outside the ordinary course and incur additional indebtedness. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with these covenants. The Agility Loan requires a security interest in all of our personal property and intellectual property, second in priority to the Lender and to SaaS Capital Funding II, LLC.  
     
  In connection with the Agility Loan, Agility Capital is entitled to purchase, under certain circumstances, Shares at the Warrant Price. The initial number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant is zero (0). On June 30, 2016, if any amounts under the Agility Loan remain outstanding, then the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall equal $31,250 divided by the Warrant Price. In addition to the foregoing, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in the loan agreement, pursuant to Section 5(a) or Section 5(b) of the Agility Loan, the number of Shares that may be acquired thereunder shall increase by an additional number of Shares equal to 5% of the number of Shares issuable thereunder upon the date of such Event of Default, and further increased on the 15th day following such Event of Default and on each Measurement Date by a number of Shares equal to 5% of the number of Shares issuable upon such Measurement Date, until the Event of Default is cured to Agility Capital s satisfaction or waived in writing by Agility Capital. On June 30, 2016, as a result of outstanding amounts under the Agility Loan, we issued to Agility Capital a warrant to purchase up to 69,444 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.45 per share. This warrant expires on March 11, 2021.   
     
  We owed $525,000 under the Agility Loan at September 30, 2016.  
     
   SaaS Capital Loan   
     
  On May 5, 2016, we entered into the SaaS Capital Loan, with SaaS Capital Funding II, LLC to borrow up to a maximum of $8,000,000. Initial amounts borrowed will accrue interest at the rate of 10.25% per annum with future amounts borrowed bearing interest at the greater of 10.25% or 9.21% plus the three-year treasury rate at the time of advance. Accrued interest on amounts borrowed is payable monthly for the first six months and thereafter 36 equal monthly payments of principal and interest is payable. Prepayments will be subject to a 10%, 6% or 3% of principal premium if prepaid prior to 12 months, between 12 and 24 months, or between 24 months and maturity, respectively. Advances may be requested until May 5, 2018. The initial minimum advance amount of $5,000,000, on May 5, 2016, was used to repay the outstanding Line of Credit balance of $4,572,223. A facility fee of $80,000 was paid by us in connection with the initial advance and an additional $80,000 is payable on May 5, 2017.   
     
  The SaaS Capital Loan contains customary covenants including, but not limited to, covenants to achieve specified Adjusted EBITDA levels and revenue renewal levels, limiting capital expenditures and restricting our ability to pay dividends, purchase and sell assets outside the ordinary course and incur additional indebtedness. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with such covenants. The occurrence of a material adverse change will be an event of default under the SaaS Capital Loan, in addition to other customary events of default. We granted SaaS Capital Funding II, LLC a security interest in all of our personal property and intellectual property through the SaaS Capital Loan and the Patent, Trademark and Copyright Security Agreement between us and SaaS Capital Funding II, LLC.  
     
  On May 5, 2016, in connection with the SaaS Capital Loan, we issued to SaaS Capital Partners II, LP, an affiliate of SaaS Capital Funding II, LLC, a warrant to purchase up to 1,333,333 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.45 per share subject to certain adjustments for dividends, splits or reclassifications. The Warrant is exercisable until the earlier of May 5, 2026, or the date that is 5 years from the date our equity securities are first listed for trading on NASDAQ. We paid approximately $169,000 in financing costs through September 30, 2016.   
     
  We owed $6,000,000 under the SaaS Capital Loan at September 30, 2016.

Changes in Cash Flows   

Changes in Cash Flows During the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016    
     
  The decrease in accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, is due to an increase in revenues. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to reduced vendor payables and lower accruals.  
     
  Cash used in investing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 consists primarily of capitalization of development costs for internal-use software of approximately $1,600,000. Cash used in investing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 consisted primarily of purchases of computer equipment and other capital expenditures of approximately $150,000, and capitalization of development costs for internal-use software of approximately $950,000.  
     
  Cash provided by financing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 resulted from the proceeds from the $625,000 Agility Loan and $6,000,000 SaaS Capital Loan, offset by the repayments of the Line of Credit of $4,635,000 and the Agility Loan of $75,000 as well as the related financing expenses of approximately $320,000. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 resulted from the proceeds from the exercise of warrants of approximately $10,000, a $1,315,000 draw down on the Line of Credit, and $1,850,000 in net proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock offset by $143,000 in expense related to the offering.  
     
  The increase in net cash flows during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the prior year period, was primarily a result of the Agility and SaaS Capital Loans, necessary to support our existing and anticipated growth.    

22

Capital Raising Transactions   
     
   Exercise of warrants   
     
  There were no proceeds generated from the exercise of warrants during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016.  
     
   Other outstanding obligations at September 30, 2016   
       
    Loans    
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we owed $0 under the Line of Credit, $525,000 under the Agility Loan, and $6,000,000 under the SaaS Capital Loan.  
      
    Warrants    
     
  As of September 30, 2016, 7,603,716 shares of our Common Stock are issuable pursuant to the exercise of warrants.  
     
    Options    
     
  As of September 30, 2016, 13,175,000 shares of our Common Stock are issuable pursuant to the exercise of options.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
     
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  
     
   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   
     
  We are exposed to a variety of risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.  
     
   Foreign Currency Exchange Risk   
     
  Transactions that occur in our Subsidiary are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations when converted to our reporting currency. As a result, our earnings are at risk as it relates to exchange rate fluctuations. A relatively small amount of our monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies, principally the British Pound. Fluctuations in these currencies relative to the United States Dollar will result in transaction gains or losses included in net earnings.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we held cash funds of approximately $42,000 in British Pounds in our Subsidiary s bank. We did not hold any amounts of other foreign currencies. If rates of the British Pound were to strengthen or weaken relative to the United States Dollar, we would realize gains or losses in converting these funds back into United States Dollars. In any event, given the small amounts, we do not expect fluctuations in exchange rates to have a material adverse effect on our business.   
     
   Interest Rate Risk   
     
  A portion of our debt may be exposed to future interest rate fluctuations. As a result, our earnings are at risk in relation to interest rate fluctuations. On May 5, 2016, we entered into the SaaS Capital Loan, allowing us to borrow up to a maximum of $8,000,000 over the next two years with repayment schedules which extend for approximately three further years. While initial amounts borrowed will accrue interest at the rate of 10.25% per annum, future amounts borrowed, if any, will bear interest at the greater of 10.25% or 9.21% plus the three-year treasury rate at the time of advance. Over the past five years, the three-year treasury rate has ranged from approximately 0.29% to approximately 1.38%. While future treasury rates are uncertain, we do not expect fluctuations in our applicable interest rates to have a material adverse effect on our business.  

Item 4. Controls and Procedures   
     
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
     
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, who is our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
         
    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
     
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

23

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   
     
   Item 1. Legal Proceedings   
       
  From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings, including the following, that we currently believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.  
     
   McCollum Litigation   
     
  We are currently involved in a litigation with Jeff McCollum, the former President of our CAKE division, in the Superior Court of the State of California, commenced by us on February 22, 2015, whereby we asserted claims against Mr. McCollum for fraud, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty, among others, following our termination of Mr. McCollum s employment on September 8, 2014 for cause as a result of, among other things, Mr. McCollum having abandoned his position and professional responsibilities. Mr. McCollum filed a cross complaint alleging breach of contract by us with respect to Mr. McCollum s employment agreement and commenced a separate action on February 23, 2015 in the Superior Court of the State of California asserting claims against us for violation of California Commercial Code  8401 and breach of fiduciary duty arising from Mr. McCollum s request to have the restrictive legend removed from his share certificate representing 1.89 million shares of our Common Stock owned by him, and seeking declaratory relief as to whether he is entitled to have the restrictive legend removed from his share certificate. On April 27, 2016, the court granted Mr. McCollum summary adjudication as to his declaratory relief cause of action to have the restrictive legend removed from his share certificate.   
     
    Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.       
   
  On July 1, 2016, we issued 120,000 restricted shares of our Common Stock, at a value of $0.50 per share, vesting in 4 equal quarterly increments commencing on July 1, 2016, to each of our non-employee directors as partial annual compensation for services as a director. These issuances are exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act as not involving any public offering.

Exhibit 10.1   

Restricted Stock Agreement   
     
  This Restricted Stock Award Agreement (this  Agreement   ) is made and entered into as of July 1, 2016 (the  Grant Date   ) by and between Accelerize Inc. a Delaware corporation (the  Company   ), and [Director] (the  Grantee   ).  
     
  WHEREAS, the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board ) has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to grant the award of Restricted Stock provided for herein.  
     
  NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:  
     
  1.        Grant of Restricted Stock . The Company hereby issues to the Grantee on the Grant Date a restricted stock award consisting of, in the aggregate, 120,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Common Stock ), of the Company at a value of $0.50 per share (the  Restricted Stock   ), on the terms and conditions and subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement.   
     
  2.        Consideration . The grant of the Restricted Stock is made in consideration of the services to be rendered by the Grantee to the Company as a director.   
     
  3.        Restricted Period; Vesting .  
     
  3.1     Except as otherwise provided herein, provided that the Grantee remains in Continuous Service (as defined below) through the applicable vesting date, the Restricted Stock will vest in 4 equal quarterly increments commencing on July 1, 2016. For purposes of this Agreement,  Continuous Service  shall mean the Grantee remaining as a director of the Company.  
     
  The period over which the Restricted Stock vests is referred to as the  Restricted Period   .  
     
  3.2     The foregoing vesting schedule notwithstanding, if the Grantee's Continuous Service terminates for any reason at any time before all of his Restricted Stock has vested, the Grantee's unvested Restricted Stock shall be automatically forfeited upon such termination of Continuous Service and neither the Company nor any affiliate shall have any further obligations to the Grantee under this Agreement.  
     
  3.3      The foregoing vesting schedule notwithstanding, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined below), 100% of the unvested Restricted Stock shall vest as of the date of the Change in Control. For purposes of this Agreement, the term  Change in Control  shall mean (i) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, (ii) the sale of more than fifty percent of the outstanding capital stock of the Company in a non-public sale, (iii) the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or (iv) any merger, share exchange, tender offer, share acquisition, consolidation or other reorganization or business combination of the Company if immediately after such transaction either (A) persons who were directors of the Company immediately prior to such transaction do not constitute at least a majority of the directors of the surviving entity or (B) persons who hold a majority of the voting capital stock of the surviving entity are not persons who held a majority of the voting capital stock of the Company immediately prior to the transaction; provided, however, that the term  Change in Control  shall not include a public offering of capital stock of the Company that is effected pursuant to a registration statement filed with, and declared effective by, the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  

3.4     Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Board determines, after full consideration of the facts, that:     
     
  (a)     the Grantee has been engaged in fraud, embezzlement or theft in the course of his involvement with the Company, has made unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary information of the Company or of a third party who has entrusted such information to the Company or has been convicted of a felony or any crime that reflects negatively upon the Company; or  
     
  (b)     the Grantee has violated the terms of any noncompetition, nonsolicitation, confidentiality, nondisclosure or other agreement with the Company to which he is a party; or  
     
  (c)     the involvement with the Company of the Grantee was terminated for  cause,  as defined in any agreement with the Grantee governing his Continuous Service, or if there is no such agreement, as determined by the Board, which may determine that  cause  includes among other matters the willful failure or refusal of the Grantee to perform and carry out his assigned duties and responsibilities diligently and in a manner satisfactory to the Board;  
     
  then as of the date of such act (in the case of (a) or (b)) or such termination (in the case of (c)), the Grantee shall forfeit the unvested Restricted Stock and the Company shall have the right to repurchase all or any part of the vested Restricted Stock, at a price equal to the lower of (x) $0.50 per share, or (y) the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of such shares at the time of repurchase. The decision of the Board as to the cause of the Grantee s discharge and the damage done to the Company shall be final, binding and conclusive. No decision of the Board, however, shall affect in any manner the finality of the discharge of the Grantee by the Company. The  Fair Market Value  of a share of Common Stock at any particular date shall be determined according to the following rules: (i) if the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading on a stock exchange, the Fair Market Value shall be the closing price of the Common Stock on the date in question, (ii) if the Common Stock is not at the time listed or admitted to trading on a stock exchange, the Fair Market Value shall be the closing bid price of the Common Stock on the date in question in the over-the-counter market;  provided ,  however , that if the price of the Common Stock is not so reported, the Fair Market Value shall be determined in good faith by the Board.  

2

4.        Restrictions . Subject to any exceptions set forth in this Agreement, during the Restricted Period, the Restricted Stock or the rights relating thereto may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Grantee without the prior written consent of the Board. Any attempt to assign, alienate, pledge, attach, sell or otherwise transfer or encumber the Restricted Stock or the rights relating thereto during the Restricted Period in contravention of this section shall be wholly ineffective and, if any such attempt is made, the Restricted Stock will be forfeited by the Grantee and all of the Grantee's rights to such shares shall immediately terminate without any payment or consideration by the Company.  
     
  5.        Rights as Shareholder; Dividends .  
     
  5.1     The Grantee shall be the record owner of the Restricted Stock until the shares of Common Stock are sold or otherwise disposed of, and shall be entitled to all of the rights of a shareholder of the Company including, without limitation, the right to vote such shares and receive all dividends or other distributions paid with respect to such shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dividends or other distributions shall be subject to the same restrictions on transferability as the shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid.  
     
  5.2     The Company may issue stock certificates or evidence the Grantee's interest by using a restricted book entry account with the Company's transfer agent. Physical possession or custody of any stock certificates that are issued shall be retained by the Company until such time as the Restricted Stock vests.  
     
  5.3     If the Grantee forfeits any rights he has under this Agreement in accordance with Section 3, the Grantee shall, on the date of such forfeiture, no longer have any rights as a shareholder with respect to the Restricted Stock and shall no longer be entitled to vote or receive dividends on such shares.  
     
  6.        No Right to Continued Service . This Agreement shall not confer upon the Grantee any right to be retained in any position, as an employee, consultant or director of the Company. Further, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the discretion of the Company to terminate the Grantee's Continuous Service at any time.   
     
  7.        Adjustments . In the event that the outstanding shares of Common Stock are hereafter exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company, by reason of a reorganization, recapitalization, exchange of shares, stock split, combination of shares or dividend payable in shares or other securities, a corresponding adjustment shall be made by the Board in the number of and/or kind of shares of Restricted Stock. Any such adjustment made by the Board shall be conclusive and binding upon all affected persons, including the Company and the Grantee. If the Restricted Stock is converted into or exchanged for, or stockholders of the Company receive by reason of any distribution in total or partial liquidation, securities of another corporation or other entity, or other property, pursuant to any merger or consolidation of the Company or acquisition of its assets, then the rights of the Company under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Company s successor and this Agreement shall apply to the securities received upon such conversion, exchange or distribution in the same manner and to the same extent as the Restricted Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Restricted Stock is converted into cash pursuant to any such transaction, the Grantee will receive such cash free and clear of any restrictions imposed by this Agreement.  

3

8.        Tax Liability and Withholding .  
     
  8.1     The Grantee shall be required to pay to the Company, and the Company shall have the right to deduct from any compensation paid to the Grantee, the amount of any required withholding taxes in respect of the Restricted Stock and to take all such other action as the Board deems necessary to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such withholding taxes. The Board may permit the Grantee to satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation by any of the following means, or by a combination of such means:   
     
  (a)     tendering a cash payment;  
     
  (b)     authorizing the Company to withhold shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable or deliverable to the Grantee as a result of the vesting of the Restricted Stock;  provided, however , that no shares of Common Stock shall be withheld with a value exceeding the minimum amount of tax required to be withheld by law; or  
     
  (c)     delivering to the Company previously owned and unencumbered shares of Common Stock.  
     
  8.2     Notwithstanding any action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, or other tax-related withholding ( Tax-Related Items   ), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Grantee's responsibility and the Company (a) makes no representation or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with the grant or vesting of the Restricted Stock or the subsequent sale of any shares; and (b) does not commit to structure the Restricted Stock to reduce or eliminate the Grantee's liability for Tax-Related Items.  
     
  9.        Section 83(b) Election . The Grantee may make an election under Code Section 83(b) (a  Section 83(b) Election   ) with respect to the Restricted Stock. Any such election must be made within thirty (30) days after the Grant Date. If the Grantee elects to make a Section 83(b) Election, the Grantee shall provide the Company with a copy of an executed version and satisfactory evidence of the filing of the executed Section 83(b) Election with the US Internal Revenue Service. The Grantee agrees to assume full responsibility for ensuring that the Section 83(b) Election is actually and timely filed with the US Internal Revenue Service and for all tax consequences resulting from the Section 83(b) Election.  
     
  10.        Compliance with Law . The issuance and transfer of shares of Common Stock shall be subject to compliance by the Company and the Grantee with all applicable requirements of federal and state securities laws and with all applicable requirements of any stock exchange on which the Company's shares of Common Stock may be listed. No shares of Common Stock shall be issued or transferred unless and until any then applicable requirements of state and federal laws and regulatory agencies have been fully complied with to the satisfaction of the Company and its counsel. The Grantee understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the shares of Common Stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission or any stock exchange to effect such compliance.  

4

11.        Legends . A legend may be placed on any certificate(s) or other document(s) delivered to the Grantee indicating restrictions on transferability of the shares of Restricted Stock pursuant to this Agreement or any other restrictions that the Board may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any applicable federal or state securities laws or any stock exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are then listed or quoted. All certificates representing unvested Restricted Stock shall have affixed thereto a legend in substantially the following form, in addition to any other legends that may be required under federal or state securities laws or pursuant to Section 12 below:  
     
  THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND RIGHTS TO PURCHASE SET FORTH IN A CERTAIN RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CORPORATION AND THE REGISTERED OWNER OF THESE SHARES (OR HIS PREDECESSOR IN INTEREST).

  (a)     The Grantee has the legal right and capacity to enter into this Agreement and fully understands the terms and conditions of this Agreement;  
     
  (b)     The Grantee is acquiring the Restricted Stock for investment purposes only and not with a view to their resale or distribution; and

  13.        Notices .

  17.        Severability .

  18.        Discretionary Nature .
