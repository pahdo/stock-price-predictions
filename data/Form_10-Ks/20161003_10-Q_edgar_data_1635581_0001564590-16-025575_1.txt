 The Partnership s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ), and include the accounts of the Partnership, and all of its subsidiaries, as appropriate under consolidation accounting guidelines. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from the audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates in which the Partnership has less than a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All significant inter-entity accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal, recurring items) necessary to state fairly its financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the accounting policies previously disclosed in  Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  of the 2015 10-K. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year .

    Fiscal Years  
  On June 24, 2015, in connection with the closing of the IPO, the Partnership amended the Partnership Agreement to include a change in the fiscal year to November 30. The third quarter of the Partnership s fiscal 2016 includes the period from June 1, 2016 to August 31, 2016, and the corresponding third quarter of the Partnership s fiscal 2015 includes the period from June 1, 2015 to August 31, 2015, which are consistent with the Partnership s November 30 fiscal year end.   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements cover the period from December 1, 2015 to August 31, 2016, representing the entire nine-month period of the Partnership s first, second and third quarters of fiscal year 2016. The prior year s comparable eight-month period covers the period from December 29, 2014 through August 31, 2015, representing the first eight months of the Partnership s recently adopted fiscal year. As a result of the change in the Partnership s fiscal year end, the quarterly periods of its newly adopted fiscal year do not coincide with the historical quarterly periods previously reported by the Predecessor. Financial information for the nine months ended August 31, 2015 has not been included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the following reasons: (i) the eight months ended August 31, 2015 provide as meaningful a comparison to the nine months ended August 31, 2016 as would the nine months ended August 31, 2015; (ii) the Partnership believes that there are no significant factors, seasonal or otherwise, that would impact the comparability of information if the results for the nine months ended August 31, 2015 were presented in lieu of results for the eight months ended August 31, 2015; and (iii) it was not practicable or cost justified to prepare this information. 
 Management Estimates 
 The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the assumptions and methodology underlying the allocations of expenses incurred on the Predecessor s behalf that were recorded in the Predecessor s condensed carve-out financial statements, as well as: allowances for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable and financing receivables; estimates for future cash flows and economic useful lives of property and equipment; the fair value and residual value of leased solar power systems; fair value of financial instruments; fair value of acquired assets and liabilities; valuation of certain accrued liabilities such as accrued warranty and asset retirement obligation ( ARO  and income taxes including the related valuation allowance. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued an update to the statement of cash flows guidance, which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. One identified cash flow issue relates to distributions received from equity method investees whereby the reporting entity should make an accounting policy election to classify distributions received from equity method investees using either the cumulative earnings approach or the nature of the distribution approach. This new guidance becomes effective for the Partnership in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and is applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Partnership is evaluating the change in accounting policy from the cumulative earnings approach to the nature of the distribution approach and the impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and disclosures. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued an update to the equity method investments guidance, which eliminates the requirement that an entity retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting if an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence. The update requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. This new guidance will be effective for the Partnership beginning on December 1, 2017 using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The Partnership is evaluating the impact of this standard on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

    In February 2016, the FASB issued an update to the lease accounting guidance, which requires entities to begin recording assets a  nd liabilities arising from substantially all leases on the balance sheet. The new guidance will also require significant additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows from leases. This new guidance will be effective for the   Partnership beginning on December 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The Partnership is evaluating the impact of this st  andard on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  
 In November 2015, the FASB issued an update which requires entities that present a classified balance sheet to classify all deferred taxes as noncurrent assets or noncurrent liabilities. The Partnership adopted the new guidance retrospectively beginning on June 1, 2016.  Since the Partnership s formation, it has not classified any deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities as current on its balance sheet; therefore, there is no effect of the accounting change on prior periods. 
 In May 2014, the FASB issued a new revenue recognition standard based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of this standard for all entities by one year. The new revenue recognition standard becomes effective for the Partnership in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and is to be applied retrospectively using one of two prescribed methods. The Partnership is evaluating the application method and impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
 Other than as described above, there has been no issued accounting guidance not yet adopted by the Partnership that it believes is material or potentially material to its consolidated financial statements. 

Note 2. Business Combinations 
 Acquisition accounting is dependent upon certain valuations and other studies that must be completed as of the acquisition date. The judgments made in the context of the purchase price allocation can materially impact the Partnership s future results of operations.  
 2016 Acquisitions 
 For the acquisitions completed during the nine months ended August 31, 2016, the valuation is based on the preliminary assessment of the fair values of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of the acquisition date, and is subject to change as the Partnership obtains additional information for its estimates during the respective measurement period. 
 Kern Acquisition: 
 On January 26, 2016, OpCo and SunPower entered into the Kern Purchase Agreement, which was amended on September 28, 2016, pursuant to which OpCo agreed  to purchase an interest in a  solar energy project consisting of  systems attached to fixed-tilt carports located at 27 school sites in the Kern High School District  located in Kern County, California, and having an aggregate nameplate capacity of up to 21 MW (the  Kern Project ) . OpCo s acquisition of the Kern Project will be effectuated in four phases, with the closing of the first phase having occurred simultaneously with the execution of the Kern Purchase Agreement.  The following describes the acquisition of each phase:

 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   Continued 
   
    The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition is up to $36.6 million in cash, of which OpCo paid approximately $4.9 million on January   27, 2016 in connection with the closing of the first phase on January 26, 2016 and approximately $9.2 million on September 9, 2016 in connection with the closing of the second phase on September 9, 2016.  OpCo will pay the remaining balance of up to $22.5   million purchase price at the closings of the third and fourth phases.   
 In addition, on January 22, 2016, a subsidiary of the Kern Class B Partnership entered into a tax equity financing facility with a third-party investor, which allocates to OpCo a certain share of cash flows from the Kern Project pursuant to a distribution waterfall. Pursuant to this distribution waterfall, the tax equity investor is entitled to a quarterly amount of project cash flow until a specified  flip  point is achieved.  After the  flip  point, the cash allocations to OpCo increase.  In addition, upon reaching the flip point, OpCo has a right to purchase the tax equity investor s interests in the project for an amount that is not less than its fair market value. The tax equity investor will make capital contributions to fund purchase price payments up to approximately $31.2 million, of which $0.9 million and $1.8 million was paid on January 22, 2016 and September 9, 2016, respectively, and the remaining balance of up to $28.5 million will be made when the Kern Project s phases meet certain construction milestones and will be transferred to affiliates of SunPower for the remaining purchase price payments.

 Ownership and cash flows of the Kingbird Project are subject to a tax equity financing facility with a third-party investor, which allocates to OpCo a certain share of cash flows from the Kingbird Project pursuant to a distribution waterfall.  Pursuant to this distribution waterfall, the tax equity investor is entitled to a quarterly amount of project cash flow until a specified  flip  point, based on the achievement of a targeted internal rate of return. After the  flip  point, the cash allocations to OpCo increase.  In addition, upon reaching the flip point, OpCo has a right to purchase the tax equity investor s interests in the project for an amount that is not less than its fair market value. The tax equity investor made capital contributions to fund purchase price payments of approximately $11.7 million on February 26, 2016 and $46.8 million on May 31, 2016, which were made when the Kingbird Project s phases met certain construction milestones and were transferred to an affiliate of First Solar for the remaining purchase price payments.

    The following unaudited pro forma supplementary data gives effect to the 2015 Acquisitions as if the transactions had occurred on December 30, 2013. The unaudited pro   forma supplementary data is provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as indicative of the Partnership s results of operations had the 2015 Acquisitions been consummated on the date assumed or of the Partnership s results     of oper  ations for any future date.  

Note 3. Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates 
 As of August 31, 2016, the Partnership owns a 49% ownership interest in each of SG2 Holdings, North Star Holdings and Lost Hills Blackwell Holdings. On September 20, 2016, OpCo entered into a Contribution Agreement with SunPower and SunPower AssetCo, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SunPower, to acquire a 49% interest in a substantially completed, 102 MW photovoltaic solar generating facility located in Kings County, California (the  Henrietta Project ) for $134.0 million in cash (the  Henrietta Acquisition ).  
 An affiliate of Southern Company, which is not affiliated with the Partnership, owns the other 51% ownership interest in SG2 Holdings, North Star Holdings, Lost Hills Blackwell Holdings and the Henrietta Project. The minority membership interests are accounted for as equity method investments. The following table summarizes the activity of the Partnership s investments in its unconsolidated affiliates during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016. The Partnership s investment in the Henrietta Project will be included in the Partnership s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements beginning September 29, 2016. Please read   Note 15 Subsequent Events  for further details. 

(1)   
 
 The net income (loss) used to determine the Partnership s equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates reflects adjustments pursuant to the equity method of accounting, including the amortization of basis differences resulting from the Partnership s proportionate share of certain equity method investees  net assets exceeding their carrying values.       

(2)   
 
 On the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Partnership classifies distributions received from unconsolidated investees accounted for under the equity method using the cumulative earnings approach. Under the cumulative earnings approach, the Partnership compares cumulative distributions received, less distributions received in prior year that was determined to be returns of investment, to its share of cumulative equity in earnings (as adjusted for basis differences) for each unconsolidated investee on an inception-to-date basis. If the Partnership s inception-to-date distributions are greater than its inception-to-date equity in earnings for an unconsolidated investee, the distributions up to its inception-to-date equity in earnings are considered a return on investment and are therefore classified as cash flows from operating activities while the distributions of that unconsolidated investee in excess of its inception-to-date equity in earnings are considered to be a return of investment and are classified as cash flows from investing activities. If the Partnership s inception-to-date distributions are less than its inception-to-date equity in earnings for an unconsolidated investee, such distributions are considered to be a return on investment and are classified as cash flows from operating activities.

Note 7. Debt and Financing Obligations  
   
 Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility  
   
 On June 5, 2015, OpCo entered into a $525.0 million credit facility, consisting of a $300.0 million term loan facility, a $25.0 million delayed draw term loan facility and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility. OpCo borrowed $300.0 million under the term loan facility on June 5, 2015, which indebtedness will mature on the fifth anniversary of its issuance, at which point all amounts outstanding under the $525.0 million credit facility will become due and payable. There will be no principal amortization over the term of the credit facility. The discount and incremental debt issuance costs associated with these borrowings were $3.1 million, which included $1.7 million of debt issuance costs paid with a portion of the proceeds and $1.4 million related to a reclassification of capitalized issuance costs on the Predecessor s historical financial statements, and were reported as a direct deduction from the face amount of the note. The Partnership used the net proceeds of the term loan facility to pay distributions of $129.4 million and $168.9 million to First Solar and SunPower, respectively.    
   
   On March 30, 2016, in connection with the Kingbird Acquisition and the Hooper Acquisition, OpCo drew down $40.0 million from its revolving credit facility and $25.0 million from its delayed draw term loan facility.  As of August 31, 2016, the full amount of the $300.0 million borrowed under the term loan facility, the full amount of the $25.0 million borrowed under the delayed draw term

  loan facility, $40.0 million borrowed unde  r the revolving credit facility, and approximately $58.6 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility were outstanding. As of November 30, 2015, the full amount of the $300.0 million borrowed under the term loan facility and approximate  ly $48.8 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility were outstanding. The remaining portion of the revolving credit facility was undrawn  .       
   
 OpCo s credit facility is collateralized by a pledge of the equity of OpCo and certain of its subsidiaries. The Partnership and each of OpCo s subsidiaries, other than certain non-guarantor subsidiaries, have guaranteed the obligations of OpCo under the credit facility.    
   
 Loans outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at either (i) a base rate, which is the highest of (x) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (y) the administrative agent s prime rate and (z) one-month LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable margin; or (ii) one-, two-, three- or six-month LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The unused portion of the revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility is subject to a commitment fee of 0.30% per annum. OpCo may prepay the borrowings under the term loan facility and the delayed draw term loan facility at any time. The term loan bears an interest rate of approximately  2.52 % and 2.41% per annum as of August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015, respectively. OpCo has entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate on the borrowings under the term loan facility. For more details, p lease read   Note 8. Fair Value.   
   
 Subject to certain conditions, the credit facility includes conditional borrowing capacity for incremental commitments to increase the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility by $250.0 million, with any increase in the revolving credit facility not to exceed $100.0 million. On September 30, 2016, OpCo entered into an amendment and joinder agreement (the  Joinder Agreement ) under its existing senior secured credit facility, pursuant to which OpCo exercised this accordion feature and obtained a new  $250.0 million incremental term loan facility, increasing the maximum borrowing capacity under the credit facility to $775.0 million.  Please read   Note 15 Subsequent Events  for further details. 
   
 The credit facility contains covenants, including among others, requiring the Partnership to maintain the following financial ratios: (i) a debt to cash flow ratio of not more than (a) 5.50 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending August 31, 2016 through May 31, 2017, and (b) 5.00 to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter; and (ii) a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.75 to 1.00. In addition, an event of default occurs under the credit facility upon a change of control. The credit facility defines a change of control as occurring when, among other things, (i) the Sponsors (or either of them) cease to direct the management, directly or indirectly, of the Partnership or OpCo, or (ii) the Sponsors collectively cease to own 35% of the economic interest in OpCo. In addition, the credit facility contains customary non-financial covenants and certain restrictions that will limit the Partnership s, OpCo s and certain of the Partnership s and its domestic subsidiaries  ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional debt and to make distributions on or redeem or repurchase OpCo common units. As of August 31, 2016, the Partnership was in compliance with the debt covenants. 
 On April 6, 2016, the parties thereto amended OpCo s credit facility (i) to provide for the lenders  consent to the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement, (ii) to expand OpCo s ability to further amend the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement without lender consent in the future, subject to certain conditions, (iii) to permit certain customary restrictions on transfers of the equity interests of certain Project Entities, which are jointly owned, indirectly, by OpCo and SunPower, (iv) to supplement the Pledge and Security Agreement between the parties in light of the foregoing amendment, and (v) to make certain clarifying modifications to definitions and cross references.  
   
 The following table summarizes the Partnership s long-term debt:

 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   Continued 
   
    Quinto Solar Project Financing  
   
 In order to facilitate the construction of certain projects, the Predecessor obtained non-recourse project loans from third-party financial institutions. On October 17, 2014, the Predecessor, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Quinto Project Entity, entered into an approximately $377.0 million credit facility with Santander Bank, N.A., Mizuho Bank, Ltd. and Credit Agricole Corporate   Investment Bank (the  Quinto Credit Facility ) in connection with the construction of the Quinto Project. 
   
 On June 24, 2015, in connection with the closing of the IPO and the concurrent transfer of the Quinto Project to OpCo, the Quinto Project Entity repaid the full amount outstanding under the Quinto Credit Facility and terminated the agreement early. Immediately before termination, there were outstanding borrowings of $224.3 million under the Quinto Credit Facility. Termination of the Quinto Credit Facility became effective upon full repayment by the Quinto Project Entity on June 24, 2015. The Quinto Project Entity paid a $0.6 million fee for early repayment of the Quinto Credit Facility. 
   
 Residential Lease Financing 
   
 The Predecessor entered into two financing arrangements under which leased solar power systems were financed by two third-party investors. Under the terms of these financing arrangements, the investors provided upfront payments to the Predecessor, which the Predecessor recognized as a financing obligation that was reduced over the specified term of the arrangement as customer receivables and federal cash grants were received by the third-party investors. Non-cash interest expense was recognized on the Partnership s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations using the effective interest rate method calculated at a rate of approximately 14%-15%. 
   
 On January 30, 2015, the Predecessor entered into an agreement with the third-party investor for one of the residential lease financing arrangements that terminated such financing arrangement. In conjunction with the termination of the arrangement, the Predecessor paid $10.8 million to terminate the $10.1 million outstanding financing obligation. 
   
 On January 23, 2015, the Predecessor entered into an agreement with the third-party investor for the other residential lease financing arrangement that allowed the Predecessor to repay the outstanding financing obligation and terminate the associated agreements on or before September 30, 2015. This repayment was exercised on May 4, 2015. The Predecessor paid $29.0 million to terminate the $21.1 million outstanding financing obligation and $1.9 million accrued financing fee. 
   
 August 2011 Letter of Credit Facility with Deutsche Bank 
 In August 2011, the Predecessor s parent, SunPower, entered into a letter of credit facility agreement with Deutsche Bank, as administrative agent, and certain financial institutions. Payment of obligations under the letter of credit facility is guaranteed by the majority shareholder of SunPower, Total S.A. As of August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015   letters of credit issued and outstanding under the August 2011 letter of credit facility with Deutsche Bank which is available to SunPower for the Quinto Project and the RPU Project totaled $14.0   million and $30.7 million, respectively. The associated fees incurred for the letters of credit to Deutsche Bank were $0.1 million and $0.3 million during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016, respectively, and $0.1 million and $0.4 million during the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, respectively, and were recognized as interest expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Pursuant to the Original Omnibus Agreement, SunPower as the Sponsor who contributed the Quinto Project cancelled one of its letter of credit facilities associated with the Quinto Project upon its achieving COD in November 2015. However, SunPower will continue to maintain the remaining letters of credit under the credit facility in connection with certain reimbursable network upgrade costs related to the Quinto Project and will bear the associated fees until no later than November 2016. Since the RPU Project achieved COD in September 2015, SunPower as the Sponsor who contributed the RPU Project is in the process of terminating the related letters of credit, and the Partnership has issued the required letters of credit under its revolving credit facility.

    Note 8.   Fair Value  
 Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement (observable inputs are the preferred basis of valuation): 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.     

Level 2 Measurements are inputs that are observable for assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, other than quoted prices included within Level 1.     

Level 3 Prices or valuations that require management inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.     

 The first two levels in the hierarchy are considered observable inputs and the last is considered unobservable.   
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis     
  The following table presents the Partnership s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, categorized in accordance with the fair value hierarchy:   

Derivative financial instruments: On July 17, 2015, OpCo entered into interest rate swap agreements intended to hedge the interest rate risk on the outstanding borrowings under the term loan with an aggregate notional value of $240.0 million. Under the interest rate swap agreements, OpCo paid a fixed swap rate of interest of 1.55% and the counterparties to the agreements paid a floating interest rate based on three-month LIBOR at quarterly intervals through the maturity date of August 31, 2018. OpCo had the right to cancel the interest rate swap agreements on August 31, 2016 and any quarterly fixed payment date thereafter with a minimum of five business days  notification. OpCo exercised its right to cancel the interest rate swap agreements on August 31, 2016 and entered into new interest rate swap agreements intended to hedge the interest rate risk on the outstanding borrowings under the term loan with an aggregate notional value of $250.0 million. Under the new interest rate swap agreements, OpCo will pay a fixed swap rate of interest of approximately 0.85% and the counterparties to the agreements will pay a floating interest rate based on one-month LIBOR at monthly intervals through the maturity date of August 31, 2018. 
 As of both August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015, these interest rate swap agreements had not been designated as cash flow hedges and are reflected at fair value on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of August 31, 2016, these interest rate swap agreements have been presented in other long-term liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet since the maturity date is two years after the balance sheet date. As of November 30, 2015, these interest rate swap agreements had been presented in other current liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet since OpCo had the right to cancel the swap agreements within one year of the balance sheet date. During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016, the Partnership recorded a change in fair value of $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, within other income in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as compared to each of the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, where the Partnership recorded a change in fair value of $0.8 million within other expense. The primary inputs into the valuation of interest rate swaps are interest yield curves, interest rate volatility, and credit spreads. The Partnership's interest rate swaps are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, since all significant inputs are corroborated by market observable data. There were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the period.  
   The Predecessor entered into interest rate swap agreements, designated as cash flow hedges, in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 28, 2014 on the outstanding and forecasted future borrowings under the Quinto Credit Facility to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates. These swap agreements allowed the Predecessor to effectively convert floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments periodically over the life of the agreements. These derivatives had a maturity of more than 12 months. The Predecessor assessed the effectiveness of these cash flow hedges at inception and on a quarterly basis. If it was determined that a derivative instrument was not

   Table of Contents   
 8point3 Energy Partners LP 
 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   Continued 
   
  highly effective or the transaction was no longer deemed probable of occurring, the Predecessor discontinued hedge accounting and   recognized the ineffective portion in current period earnings. In March 2015, the Predecessor discontinued hedge accounting prospectively for its interest rate swap agreements under the Quinto Credit Facility, as it was no longer deemed probable that the h  edge transactions will occur. However, because it remained possible that the forecasted hedge transactions would occur, previously recognized loss of $3.0 million on the interest rate swaps remained in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of March 29, 2  015, and such loss was reclassified into earnings during the quarter ended June 28, 2015, the same period that the forecasted hedged transactions affect earnings or was otherwise deemed to be improbable of occurrence.   
 During the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, $2.7 million and $5.4 million, respectively, related to the ineffective portion was recognized in earnings within other expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
  Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis     
 Long-term debt and financing obligations: The estimated fair value of the Partnership s long-term debt was classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as of August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015, and approximated its carrying value of $ 362.7  million and $297.2 million, respectively, as the term loan facility is a variable rate debt with the interest rate indexed to the market and reset on a frequent and short-term basis .     

Note 9. Noncontrolling Interests  
 Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of net assets in consolidated subsidiaries that are not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Partnership. For accounting purposes, the holders of noncontrolling interests of the Partnership include the Sponsors, which are SunPower and First Solar, as described in Part I, Item 1.  Financial Information Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation,  and third-party investors under the tax equity financing facilities .   As of both August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015, First Solar and SunPower had noncontrolling interests of 31.1% and 40.7%, respectively, in OpCo.   
 In addition, certain subsidiaries of OpCo have entered into tax equity financing facilities with third-party investors under which the parties invest in entities that hold the solar power systems. The Partnership, through OpCo, holds controlling interests in these less-than-wholly-owned entities and has therefore fully consolidated these entities. The Partnership accounts for the portion of net assets using the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value ( HLBV ) Method in the consolidated entities attributable to the investors as "Redeemable noncontrolling interests" and "Noncontrolling interests" in its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries that are redeemable at the option of the noncontrolling interest holder are classified as "Redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries" between liabilities and equity on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and the balance is the greater of the carrying value calculated under the HLBV Method or the redemption value. 
 As of August 31, 2016, redeemable noncontrolling interests attributable to tax equity investors was $17.6 million after adjusting the carrying amount to the redemption value. As of November 30, 2015, redeemable noncontrolling interests attributable to tax equity investors was  $89.7 million calculated under the HLBV Method and was greater than the redemption value.  As of August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015, noncontrolling interests attributable to tax equity investors were $50.8 million and  $11.8 million , respectively.  
 In addition, in connection with the Kern Phase 1(a) Acquisition on January 26, 2016, the Kingbird Acquisition on March 31, 2016, the Hooper Acquisition on April 1, 2016, and the Macy s Maryland Acquisition on July 1, 2016, OpCo acquired the noncontrolling interest balances totaling $0.9 million,  $11.7 million, $23.7 million, and $0.6 million, respectively.   Please read         Note 2   Business Combinations 2016 Acquisitions    for further details.

 The following table presents the noncontrolling interest balances by entity, reported in shareholders  equity in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015:     

Note 10. Shareholders  Equity 
  On June 24, 2015, the Partnership completed its IPO by issuing 20,000,000 of its Class A shares representing limited partner interests in the Partnership to the public. As of August 31, 2016, the Partnership owned a 28.2% limited liability company interest in OpCo as well as a controlling noneconomic managing member interest in OpCo and the Sponsors collectively owned 51,000,000 Class B shares representing limited partner interests in the Partnership, and together, having owned a noncontrolling 71.8% limited liability company interest in OpCo. As of August 31, 2016, the following shares of the Partnership were outstanding:  

On September 28, 2016 the Partnership sold in an underwritten registered public offering 8,050,000 Class A shares representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the  Public Offering ).  Please read   Note 15 Subsequent Events  for further details. 
 Cash Distribution 
 The Partnership is required to distribute its available cash (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) to the holders of Class A shares each quarter as described in  Note 12. Shareholders  Equity  of the 2015 10-K.  On  July 15, 2016 , the Partnership paid its second quarter distribution of $4.7 million to Class A shareholders for the period from March 1, 2016 to May 31, 2016. 

Note 11. Net Income Per Share 
    Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 and the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, respectively, attributable to Class A shareholders by the weighted average number of Class A shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted net income per share is computed using basic weighted average Class A shares outstanding plus, if dilutive, any potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period using the treasury-stock-type method. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement entered into among the   Partnership, the General Partner, OpCo, a wholly owned

  subsidiary of SunPower and a wholly owned subsidiary of First Solar, the Sponsors can tender OpCo common units and an equal numb  er of such Sponsor s Class B shares for redemption, and the Partnership has the right to directly purchase the tendered OpCo common units and Class B shares for, subject to the approval of its conflicts committee, cash or the issuance of Class A shares of   the Partnership. If the Partnership elects to issue Class A shares, it would cancel the tendered Class B shares and hold the OpCo common units with the other OpCo common units it previously held, since the number of Class A shares issued must at all time e  qual the number of OpCo common units held by the Partnership. Since the Partnership would be holding additional OpCo common units, the net income   attributable to Class A shares would proportionately increase, resulting in no change to net income per share   for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 and the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, there were no potentially dilutive securities (including any stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units) fo  r the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 and the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, respectively. Accordingly, basic and diluted net income per share for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 and the three and eight months end  ed August 31, 2015, respectivly, was as follows:  

(1)   
 
  Up to the amount of OpCo common units held by Sponsors

    Note 12. Related Parties    
 Management Services Agreements 
 Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO on June 24, 2015, the Partnership, together with the General Partner, OpCo and Holdings, entered into similar but separate Management Services Agreements (the  MSAs ) with affiliates of each of the Sponsors (each, a  Service Provider ). Under the MSAs, the Service Providers will provide or arrange for the provision of certain administrative and management services for the Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries, including managing the Partnership s day-to-day affairs, in addition to those services that are provided under existing O M agreements and asset management agreements ( AMAs ) between affiliates of the Sponsors and certain of the subsidiaries of the Partnership. In August 2015, the First Solar MSA and the SunPower MSA were amended to adjust the annual management fee payable to each respective Service Provider. In the case of the First Solar MSA, OpCo will initially pay an annual management fee of $0.6 million to the First Solar Service Provider. In the case of the SunPower MSA, OpCo will initially pay an annual management fee of $1.1 million to the SunPower Service Provider. These payments are subject to annual adjustments for inflation. Between December 1, 2015 and November 30, 2016, each Service Provider will have a one-time right to increase the management fee by an amount not to exceed 15%. 
 Costs incurred for these services were $0.4   million and $1.2 million for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016, respectively. Costs incurred for these services were $0.3 million in each of the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015.  
 Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreements 
 Various projects are designed, engineered, constructed and commissioned pursuant to EPC agreements with affiliates of the Sponsors, which may include a 2- to 10-year system warranty against defects in materials, construction, fabrication and workmanship, and in some cases, may include a 25-year power and product warranty on certain modules. 
 As of August 31, 2016, all of the projects contributed by the Sponsors on the date of the IPO have achieved COD and the Kern Phase 1(a) Assets and the Macy s Maryland Project are construction-in-progress and expected to achieve COD in December 2016 and October 2016, respectively. SunPower as the EPC provider is required to complete the Kern Phase 1(a) Assets, the Kern Phase 1(b) Assets and the Macy s Maryland Project and pursuant to the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement, all the associated costs to complete the Kern Phase 1(a) Assets, the Kern Phase 1(b) Assets and the Macy s Maryland Project are obligations of SunPower. 
 Operations and Maintenance Agreements and Asset Management Agreements 
 The Project Entities and certain other subsidiaries have entered into O M agreements and AMAs with affiliates of the Sponsors, as applicable (except where such persons are otherwise subject to O M agreements or AMAs with unaffiliated third parties). Under the terms of the O M agreements and the AMAs, such affiliates have agreed to provide a variety of operation, maintenance and asset management services, and certain performance warranties or availability guarantees, to the subsidiaries of the Partnership in exchange for annual fees, which are subject to certain adjustments. 
 O M services to the leased solar power systems, also known as executory costs, were allocated to the Predecessor by SunPower and disclosed as cost of operations-SunPower in the combined carve-out statement of operations of the Predecessor.  
 Costs incurred for O M and AMA services  were $1.5 million and $3.8 million for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016, respectively, compared to $0.1 million and $0.5 million for the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, respectively . 
 Omnibus Agreement 
   In connection with the IPO, the Partnership entered into an omnibus agreement (the  Original Omnibus Agreement ), with its Sponsors, the General Partner, OpCo and Holdings, under which (i) each Sponsor was granted an exclusive right to perform certain services not otherwise covered by an O M agreement or an AMA on behalf of the IPO Project Entities contributed by such Sponsor, (ii) with respect to any project in the Portfolio that did not achieve commercial operation as of the closing of the IPO, the Sponsor who contributed such project will pay to OpCo all costs required to complete such project, as well as certain liquidated damages in the event such project fails to achieve operability pursuant to an agreed schedule, (iii) each Sponsor agreed to certain undertakings on the part of its affiliates who are members of the IPO Project Entities or who provide asset management, construction, operating and maintenance and other services to the IPO Project Entities contributed by such Sponsor, (iv) to the extent a Sponsor continues to post credit support on behalf of an IPO Project Entity after it has been contributed to OpCo, OpCo agreed to reimburse such Sponsor upon

  any demand or draw under such credit support, and the Sponsor agreed to maintain such support pursuant to the applicable underlying contractual or regulatory requirements, (v) each Sponsor agreed to indemnify OpCo fo  r any costs it incurs with respect to certain tax-related events and events in connection with tax equity financing arrangements, and (vi) the parties agreed to a mutual undertaking regarding confidentiality and use of names, trademarks, trade names and ot  her insignias.  
 In August 2015, the Original Omnibus Agreement was amended to provide that (i) with respect to each of the North Star Project and the Quinto Project, which were contributed to the Partnership by First Solar and SunPower, respectively, the Sponsors agreed to pay to OpCo the difference, if any, between the amount of network upgrade refunds projected to be received in respect of the Sponsor s project at the time of contribution and the amount of network upgrade refunds projected to be received in respect of such project at the commencement of commercial operation of such project; and (ii) SunPower agreed to indemnify OpCo for certain costs it may incur in connection with the termination of certain tax equity financing arrangements relating to the contributed residential lease portfolios, which occurred before the Partnership s IPO. During the three months ended February 29, 2016, the Partnership received a $10.0 million indemnity payment for a shortfall associated with the network upgrade refunds projected to be received.  
 In November 2015, the Original Omnibus Agreement was amended to provide that the indemnity for energy produced prior to commercial operation owed by each Sponsor to OpCo will be calculated on an aggregate basis with respect to all projects contributed by such Sponsor in connection with the IPO, rather than on a project-by-project basis. As a result of this indemnity, the Partnership received $3.9 million as an indemnity payment from SunPower for a test energy shortfall associated with the Quinto Project.   
 On January 26, 2016, March 31, 2016 and April 1, 2016, in connection with the Kern Phase 1(a) Acquisition, Kingbird Acquisition and Hooper Acquisition, respectively, the Original Omnibus Agreement was amended to update the schedules thereto to include the solar power systems held indirectly by the Kern Class B Partnership at the closing of the Kern Phase 1(a) Acquisition, the Kingbird Project and the Hooper Project, respectively, for all purposes, except for certain tax indemnities which are included in the Kern Purchase Agreement, Kingbird Purchase Agreement and Hooper Purchase Agreement. 
 On April 6, 2016, the Partnership amended and restated the Original Omnibus Agreement (as amended and restated, the  Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement ) with its Sponsors, the General Partner, OpCo and Holdings (i) to expand each sponsor s tax equity indemnification obligations (as further discussed below), (ii) to provide that the sponsors  obligation to cover costs required to achieve commercial operation (as further discussed below) will be reduced to the extent OpCo and its affiliates receive alternate funds that are contemplated to be used to pay project expenses, and such funds are applied accordingly, and (iii) to integrate changes from prior amendments to the Original Omnibus Agreement disclosed above. The material provisions of the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement are as follows: (a) each Sponsor was granted an exclusive right to perform certain services not otherwise covered by an O M agreement or an AMA on behalf of the Project Entities contributed by such Sponsor; (b) with respect to any project in the Portfolio that has not achieved commercial operation, the Sponsor who contributed such project will pay to OpCo all costs required to complete such project, subject to certain exclusions; (c) with respect to any project in the Portfolio that did not achieve commercial operation as of the closing of the IPO, the Sponsor who contributed such project will pay to OpCo certain liquidated damages in the event such project fails to achieve operability pursuant to an agreed schedule; (d) with respect to the Quinto Project and the North Star Project, the Sponsor who contributed such project will pay to OpCo the difference, if any, between the amount of network upgrade refunds projected to be received in respect of such sponsor s project at the time of contribution and the amount of network upgrade refunds projected to be received given the actual amount of upgrade costs incurred in respect of such project; (e) certain undertakings on the part of each Sponsor s affiliates who act as a manager of any Project Entity or who provide asset management, construction, operating and maintenance and other services to the Project Entities contributed by such Sponsor; (f) to the extent a Sponsor continues to post credit support on behalf of a Project Entity after it has been contributed to OpCo, OpCo agreed to reimburse such Sponsor upon any demand or draw under such credit support, and the Sponsor agreed to maintain such support pursuant to the applicable underlying contractual or regulatory requirements; (g) each Sponsor agreed to indemnify OpCo for any costs it incurs with respect to certain tax-related events and events in connection with tax equity financing arrangements; and (h) the parties agreed to a mutual undertaking regarding confidentiality and use of names, trademarks, trade names and other insignias. Upon the execution of the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement, the tax indemnities included in the Kern Purchase Agreement, the Kingbird Purchase Agreement and the Hooper Purchase Agreement automatically terminated .  
 On July 1, 2016 and September 9, 2016, in connection with the Macy s Maryland Acquisition and the Kern Phase 1(b) Acquisition,   respectively, the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement was amended to update the schedules thereto to include the Macy s Maryland Project and  the solar power systems held indirectly by the Kern Class B Partnership at the closing of the Kern Phase 1(b) Acquisition  for all purposes.

    Operating Expense Allocations  
 The Predecessor s condensed carve-out financial statements include allocations of certain SunPower operating expenses. The allocations include: (i) charges that were incurred by SunPower that were specifically identified as attributable to the Predecessor; and (ii) an allocation of applicable SunPower operating expenses based on the proportional level of effort attributable to the operation of the Predecessor s portfolio of solar power systems leased to residential homeowners and projects under construction. These expenses include legal, accounting, tax, treasury, information technology, insurance, employee benefit costs, human resources, procurement and other corporate services and infrastructure costs. The allocation of applicable SunPower operating expenses was principally based on management s estimate of the proportional level of effort devoted by corporate resources. The amounts allocated to the Predecessor related to SunPower operating expenses were $0.8 million and $4.8 million for the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, respectively, and are disclosed as SG A expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

Note 13. Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying the statutory U.S. federal rate of 35% primarily due to the tax impact of equity in earnings, the tax impact of noncontrolling interest, a permanent difference between the amount recognized as deductible for U.S. GAAP and tax purposes related to board of director share-based compensation, and state tax rates (net of federal benefit) in various jurisdictions, most significantly California.  
 The Partnership s financial reporting year-end is November 30 while its tax year-end is December 31. The Partnership has elected to base the tax provision on the financial reporting year; therefore, since the 2016 financial reporting year is December 1, 2015 through November 30, 2016, the taxable income (loss) included in the 2016 tax provision is for the tax year ended December 31, 2015. The provision accrued at the financial reporting year-end will be a discrete period computation, and the tax credits and permanent differences recognized in that accrual will be those generated between the tax year-end date and the financial reporting year-end date. Since 2015 is the Partnership s year of formation, any amounts recorded for income tax provision (benefit) following the IPO primarily represent deferred income taxes being provided on the net income before taxes of OpCo, a non-taxable partnership, which is allocated to the Partnership. The Predecessor s loss for the period from December 28, 2014 to the date of the IPO was approximately $20.1 million or $7.0 million tax-effected. 
 Although organized as a limited partnership under state law, the Partnership elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Partnership is subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate rates on its net taxable income, and distributions it makes to holders of its Class A shares will be taxable as ordinary dividend income to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits as computed for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  
 The Partnership accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 The Partnership recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Partnership considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. If the Partnership determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. 
 The Partnership records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740   Income Taxes on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) it determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Partnership recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. 

Note 14. Segment Information  
 The Partnership manages its Portfolio as one segment that operates a portfolio of solar energy generation systems. It operates as a single reportable segment based on the  management  approach.

    All operating revenues for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 and three and eight months ende  d August 31, 2015 were from customers located in the United States and over 90% of the Partnership s total revenue for all periods was comprised of lease revenue. Operating revenues from one customer, First Solar, as lessee of the Maryland Solar Project, a  ccounted for less than 10% of total operating revenues for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016, compared to   32% and 15%   in the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, respectively. Long-lived assets consisting of property and equipment, n  et, were located in the United States.  

Note 15. Subsequent Events 
 On September 9, 2016, OpCo paid approximately $9.2 million with cash on hand in connection with the Kern Phase 1(b) Acquisition.  The Kern Phase 1(b) Acquisition qualifies as a business combination and the Partnership accounts for the transaction under the acquisition method.  The purchase allocation of the Kern Phase 1(b) Assets disclosed in the following table is  based on the preliminary assessment of the fair values of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of the acquisition date, and is subject to change as the Partnership obtains additional information for its estimates during the respective measurement period .  Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition have not been presented as the impact of the acquisition is not material to the Partnership s consolidated results of operations for the current or prior periods. The results of operations of the Kern Phase 1(b) Assets will be included in the Partnership s consolidated results of operations beginning September 9, 2016.  Please read   Note 2 Business Combinations  for more details . On September 28, 2016, the Kern Purchase Agreement was amended pursuant to which the aggregate nameplate capacity of the Kern Project increased by up to 1 MW and OpCo s aggregate purchase price for the acquisition increased by up to $1.6 million. 

On September 19, 2016, the board of directors of our general partner declared a cash distribution for its Class A shares of $0.2406 per share for the third quarter of 2016. The board of directors declared a corresponding cash distribution for OpCo s common and subordinated units, which includes all common and subordinated units held by First Solar and SunPower. The third quarter distribution will be paid on October 14, 2016 to shareholders and unitholders of record as of October 3, 2016. 
 On September 20, 2016, OpCo entered into a Contribution Agreement with SunPower and SunPower AssetCo, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SunPower, to acquire a 49% interest in the Henrietta Project for $134.0 million in cash. A subsidiary of Southern Company owns the other 51% of the Henrietta Project and controls the governing board of the project. The Henrietta Acquisition closed on September 29, 2016 and OpCo funded the purchase price with a combination of net proceeds of the Public Offering, cash on hand and drawings under OpCo s revolving credit facility. 
 On September 28, 2016, the Partnership sold 8,050,000 Class A shares in the Public Offering for net proceeds of $113.7 million ($117.9 million gross proceeds, or $14.65 per Class A share, less $3.5 million of underwriting discount and $0.7 million of transaction fees). 
 On September 30, 2016, OpCo entered into the Joinder Agreement under its existing senior secured credit facility, pursuant to which OpCo obtained a new $250.0 million incremental term loan facility, increasing the maximum borrowing capacity under the credit facility to $775.0 million. The Joinder Agreement also amends OpCo s credit facility to, among other things, (i) permit OpCo to incur up to $50.0 million in subordinated indebtedness from First Solar or its affiliate to pay a portion of the purchase price for the potential acquisition of an interest in a solar energy project located in San Bernardino County, California, that has a nameplate capacity of 300 MW (the  Stateline Project ), and (ii) increase OpCo s maximum debt-to-cash-flow ratio (as more fully defined in the OpCo s credit facility) in respect of the fiscal quarters ending November 30, 2016 through November 30, 2017 from 5.50:1.00 to 6.00:1.00, and for all fiscal quarters thereafter from 5.00:1.00 to 5.50:1.00 (except that the prior thresholds will continue to apply under certain circumstances).  All other existing terms of OpCo s senior secured credit facility remain unchanged. 
   On September 30, 2016, OpCo entered into an amendment and waiver to the Right of First Offer Agreement with SunPower (the  SunPower ROFO Waiver ). Pursuant to the SunPower ROFO Agreement, SunPower previously granted to OpCo a right of first

 Overview 
 Description of Partnership 
 We are a growth-oriented limited partnership formed by First Solar and SunPower, our Sponsors, to own, operate and acquire solar energy generation projects. Our IPO was completed on June 24, 2015, by issuing 20,000,000 Class A shares representing limited partner interests to the public. As of August 31, 2016, we owned a 28.2% limited liability company interest in OpCo as well as a controlling non-economic managing member interest in OpCo and the Sponsors collectively owned 51,000,000 Class B shares in the Partnership, with SunPower and First Solar owning 28,883,075 and 22,116,925 Class B shares, respectively, and together owning a noncontrolling 71.8% limited liability company interest in OpCo. Because we consolidate OpCo, our financial results are shown on a 100% basis and are not adjusted to reflect our Sponsors  noncontrolling limited liability company interest in OpCo. 
 We received $393.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of the Class A shares in the IPO after deducting the underwriting fees and structuring fees (but before offering expenses, which were paid by our Sponsors). We used all of the net proceeds of the IPO to purchase 20,000,000 OpCo common units from OpCo. OpCo used (i) approximately $154.4 million of such net proceeds to make a cash distribution to First Solar, (ii) approximately $201.6 million of such net proceeds to make a cash distribution to SunPower and (iii) approximately $37.8 million of such net proceeds for general purposes, including to fund future acquisition opportunities. On September 28, 2016, we sold in an underwritten registered public offering 8,050,000 Class A shares representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the  Public Offering ), for net proceeds of $113.7 million ($117.9 million gross proceeds, or $14.65 per Class A share, less $3.5 million of underwriting discount and $0.7 million of transaction fees).   
 Our Portfolio 
   As of August 31, 2016, our Portfolio, which we acquired from our Sponsors, consists of interests in 530 MW of solar energy projects. As of  August 31 , 2016, we owned interests in eight utility-scale solar energy projects, all of which are operational. These assets represent 88% of the generating capacity of our Portfolio. As of August 31, 2016, we owned interests in four commercial and industrial ( C I ) solar energy projects, two of which were operational and two of which was in late-stage construction, and a portfolio of residential DG Solar assets, which represent 12% of the generating capacity of our Portfolio. Our Portfolio is located entirely in the United States and consists of utility-scale and C I assets that sell substantially all of their output under long-term,

 2016 Acquisitions 
 On January 26, 2016, OpCo and SunPower entered into the Kern Purchase Agreement, which was amended on September 28, 2016, pursuant to which OpCo agreed to purchase an interest in the Kern Project for aggregate consideration of up to $36.6 million in cash. On March 31, 2016, OpCo entered into the Kingbird Purchase Agreement with First Solar, pursuant to which OpCo agreed to acquire an interest in the Kingbird Project for aggregate consideration of $60.0 million in cash. On March 31, 2016, OpCo entered into the Hooper Purchase Agreement with SunPower, pursuant to which OpCo agreed to acquire an interest in the Hooper Project for aggregate consideration of $53.5 million in cash. On June 29, 2016, OpCo entered into the Macy s Maryland Purchase Agreement with SunPower, pursuant to which OpCo agreed to acquire an interest in the Macy s Maryland Project for aggregate consideration of $12.0 million in cash.  On September 20, 2016, OpCo entered into a Contribution Agreement with SunPower and SunPower AssetCo, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SunPower, to acquire a 49% interest the Henrietta Project for $134.0 million in cash.

 How We Generate Revenues 
 Our revenues are a function of the volume of electricity generated and sold by our projects and rental payments under lease agreements. The assets in our Portfolio sell substantially all of their output or are leased under long-term, fixed price offtake agreements with investment grade utility-scale and C I offtakers, as well as high credit quality residential customers with an average FICO score of 765 at the time of initial contract. As of August 31, 2016, the weighted average remaining life of offtake agreements across our Portfolio was 20.6 years, with the offtake agreements of our Utility Project Entities having remaining terms ranging from 16.6 to 27.3 years and our C I offtake agreements and residential offtake agreements having remaining terms ranging from 16.0 to 20.0 years .  
 Under our Utility Project Entities  offtake agreements, each Utility Project Entity generally receives a fixed price over the term of the offtake agreement with respect to 100% of its output, subject to certain adjustments. Our Utility Project Entities  offtake agreements have certain availability or production requirements, and if such requirements are not met, then in some cases the applicable project is required to pay the offtake counterparty a specified damages amount, and in some cases the offtake counterparty has the right to terminate the offtake agreement or reduce the contract quantity. In addition, under our Utility Project Entities  offtake agreements, each party typically has the right to terminate upon written notice ranging from ten to 60 days following the occurrence of an event of default that has not been cured within the applicable cure period, if any .  
 Under the offtake agreements of our C I Project Entities, each C I Project Entity generally receives a fixed price over the term of the offtake agreement with respect to 100% of its output, subject to certain adjustments. Certain of our C I Project Entities  offtake agreements have availability or production requirements, and if such requirements are not met, the offtake counterparty has the right to terminate the offtake agreement. Under our C I Project Entities  offtake agreements, each party typically has the right to terminate upon written notice ranging from ten to 30 days following the occurrence of an event of default that has not been cured within the applicable cure period, if any .  
 Under our Residential Portfolio Project Entity s offtake agreements, homeowners are obligated to make lease payments to the Residential Portfolio Project Entity on a monthly basis. The customer s monthly payment is fixed based on a calculation that takes into account expected solar energy generation, and certain of our current offtake agreements contain price escalators with an average of a 1% increase annually. Customers are eligible to purchase the leased solar power systems to facilitate the sale or transfer of their home. The agreements also include an early buy-out option at fair market value exercisable in the seventh year that allows customers to purchase the solar power system .

    How We Evaluate Our Operations  
 Our management uses a variety of financial metrics to analyze our performance. The key financial metrics we evaluate are Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution. 
 Adjusted EBITDA .    
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus interest expense, net of interest income, income tax provision, depreciation, amortization and accretion, including our proportionate share of net interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, amortization and accretion from our unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, and share-based compensation and transaction costs incurred for our acquisitions of projects; and excluding the effect of certain other non-cash or non-recurring items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance such as, but not limited to, mark to market adjustments to the fair value of derivatives related to our interest rate hedges. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. This measurement is not recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. The U.S. GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss). The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of financial performance and borrowers  ability to service debt. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management for internal planning purposes including certain aspects of our consolidated operating budget and capital expenditures. It is also used by investors to assess the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flows to make distributions to our Class A shareholders. 
 However, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool because it does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital, does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt or cash distributions on tax equity, does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes, and excludes the effect of certain other cash flow items, all of which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. In addition, our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to EBITDA as calculated by other companies. Investors should not rely on these measures as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP measure, including net income (loss). 
 Cash Available for Distribution.       
 We use cash available for distribution, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA less equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, cash interest paid, cash income taxes paid, maintenance capital expenditures, cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and principal amortization of indebtedness plus cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, indemnity payments of Sponsors, test electricity generation and cash proceeds from sales-type residential leases and state and local rebates. Our cash flow is generated from distributions we receive from OpCo each quarter. OpCo s cash flow is generated primarily from distributions from the Project Entities. As a result, our ability to make distributions to our Class A shareholders depends primarily on the ability of the Project Entities to make cash distributions to OpCo and the ability of OpCo to make cash distributions to its unitholders. 
 We believe cash available for distribution is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of our ability to make our distribution. In addition, cash available for distribution is used by our management team for determining future acquisitions and managing our growth. The U.S. GAAP measure most directly comparable to cash available for distribution is net income (loss). 
 However, cash available for distribution has limitations as an analytical tool because it does not capture the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our projects, does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and excludes the effect of certain other cash flow items, all of which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results from operations. Cash available for distribution is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. In addition, our calculations of cash available for distribution are not necessarily comparable to cash available for distribution as calculated by other companies. Investors should not rely on these measures as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP measure, including net income (loss) .

  Represents our proportionate share of net interest expense, depreciation, amortization and accretion from our unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method .    

(5)   
 
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates represents the earnings from the Solar Gen 2 Project, the North Star Project and the Lost Hills Blackwell Project and is included on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations .

        Represents cash interest payments related to our term loan and revolving credit facilities post-IPO. The interest payments for th  e Quinto Credit Facility on the Predecessor s combined carve-out financial statements were excluded as they were funded by one of our Sponsors  .       

(7)   
 
  Cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates represent the cash received by OpCo with respect to its 49% interest in the Solar Gen 2 Project, the North Star Project and the Lost Hills Blackwell Project .    

(8)   
 
 State and local rebates represent cash received from state or local governments for owning certain solar power systems. The receipt of state and local rebates is accounted for as a reduction in the asset carrying value rather than operating revenue.     

(9)   
 
  Cash proceeds from sales-type residential leases, net, represent gross rental cash receipts for sales-type leases, less sales-type  revenue and lease interest income that is already reflected in net income (loss) during the period. The corresponding revenue for such leases was recognized in the period in which such lease was placed in service, rather than in the period in which the rental payment was received, due to the characterization of these leases under U.S. GAAP.    

(10)   
 
 Represents indemnity payments from the Sponsors owed to OpCo in accordance with the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement. Please read Part I, Item 1.  Financial Information Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Related Parties .    

(11)   
 
 Test electricity generation represents the sale of electricity that was generated prior to COD by the Kingbird Project. Solar systems may begin generating electricity prior to COD as a result of the installation and interconnection of individual solar modules, which occurs over time during the construction and commission period. The sale of test electricity generation is accounted for as a reduction in the asset carrying value rather than operating revenue prior to COD, even though it generates cash for the related Project Entity.    

 Items Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results 
 Our future results of operations will not be comparable to our historical results of operations for the reasons described below. 
 Formation Transactions.    At the closing of our IPO, we acquired the IPO First Solar Project Entities, which were not included in the results of the Predecessor. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial condition and results of operations of the IPO First Solar Project Entities since June 24, 2015, the date we completed our IPO. Results of operations of the Predecessor mainly relate to our Residential Portfolio, which represents less than 10% of the assets in our Portfolio. Prior to the IPO on June 24, 2015, none of the Predecessor s Utility and C I Projects had commenced operation and the First Solar Projects were not included in the Predecessor s results of operations  .  
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense .      The Predecessor s historical combined carve-out financial statements included SG A expenses that have historically included direct charges for certain overhead and shared services expenses allocated by SunPower. Allocations for SG A services included such items as information technology, legal, human resources and other financial and administrative services. These expenses were charged or allocated to the Predecessor based on management s estimate of proportional use. Under the Management Services Agreements, which were amended in August 2015, we pay annual fees of $1.7 million to our Sponsors for general and administrative services. These annual management fees are subject to annual adjustment to reflect the cost to provide SG A services to us. In addition, our SG A expenses also include the fees we pay to our Sponsors pursuant to AMAs  .  
 Accounting for Joint Ventures .      The Predecessor s historical combined carve-out financial statements do not include equity in earnings from any minority-owned joint ventures. As of August 31, 2016, OpCo owned a 49% interest in the Solar Gen 2 Project, the North Star Project and the Lost Hills Blackwell Project; however, as these interests were previously owned by First Solar, they are not included in the Predecessor s combined carve-out financial statements. The results of operations of joint ventures in which OpCo owns a meaningful noncontrolling interest are not consolidated in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and instead are represented as earnings from equity investments  .  
   Financing.       The Predecessor s historical combined carve-out financial statements reflect indebtedness for the Quinto Project, which was paid off in connection with the closing of our IPO, and two residential financing agreements with third-party investors, both of which have been terminated. On June 5, 2015, OpCo entered into a $525.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $300.0 million term loan facility, a $25.0 million delayed draw term loan facility and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility. As of November 30, 2015, the full amount of the $300.0 million term loan facility and approximately $48.8 million of letters of credit under our revolving credit facility were outstanding. We used the proceeds of the $300.0 million term loan facility to pay distributions to our Sponsors  .   On March 30, 2016, in connection with the Kingbird Acquisition and the Hooper Acquisition, OpCo drew down $40.0 million from its revolving credit facility and $25.0 million from its delayed draw term loan facility. As of August 31, 2016, the full amount of the $300.0 million borrowed under the term loan facility, the full amount of the $25.0 million borrowed under the delayed   
   
 45 
 
   Table of Contents   
   
  draw term loan facility, $40.0 million bor  rowed under the revolving credit facility, and approximately $58.6 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility were outstanding. The remaining portion of the revolving credit facility was undrawn  .   
 Expiration of Section 1603 Cash Grant Program .      The Predecessor s combined carve-out financial statements reflect the effect of the federal Section 1603 cash grant program. This program has expired and we no longer benefit from these cash grants  .  
 Maryland Solar Lease Arrangement .      The Maryland Solar Project Entity has leased the Maryland Solar Project to an affiliate of First Solar, with the lease term expiring on December 31, 2019. Under the arrangement, First Solar s affiliate is obligated to pay a fixed amount of rent that is set based on the expected operations of the plant  .   
 Change in Fiscal Year.       On June 24, 2015, in connection with the closing of the IPO, the Partnership amended the Partnership Agreement to include a change in the fiscal year to November 30. The third quarter of the Partnership s fiscal 2016 includes the period from June 1, 2016 to August 31, 2016, and the corresponding third quarter of the Partnership s fiscal 2015 includes the period from June 1, 2015 to August 31, 2015, which are consistent with the Partnership s November 30 fiscal year end.    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements cover the period from December 1, 2015 to August 31, 2016, representing the entire nine-month period of the Partnership s first, second and third quarters of fiscal year 2016. The prior year s comparable eight-month period covers the period from December 29, 2014 through August 31, 2015, representing the first eight months of the Partnership s recently adopted fiscal year. As a result of the change in the Partnership s fiscal year end, the quarterly periods of its newly adopted fiscal year do not coincide with the historical quarterly periods previously reported by the Predecessor. Financial information for the nine months ended August 31, 2015 has not been included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the following reasons: (i) the eight months ended August 31, 2015 provide as meaningful a comparison to the nine months ended August 31, 2016 as would the nine months ended August 31, 2015; (ii) the Partnership believes that there are no significant factors, seasonal or otherwise, that would impact the comparability of information if the results for the nine months ended August 31, 2015 were presented in lieu of results for the eight months ended August 31, 2015; and (iii) it was not practicable or cost justified to prepare this information.  
 Significant Factors and Trends Affecting Our Business 
 The assets in our Portfolio sell substantially all of their output or are leased pursuant to long-term, fixed price offtake agreements. We believe these long-term agreements substantially mitigate volatility in our cash flows. Over time, our results of operations and our ability to grow our business could be impacted by a number of factors and trends that affect our industry generally, including the development of our ROFO Projects and the other projects we may acquire in the future .  
 Increasing Demand for Solar Energy 
 Global energy demand is increasing due to economic development and population growth. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects OECD electricity generation to increase 34% between 2014 and 2040, requiring an increase in capacity of more than 600 GW of electricity generation, including through solar energy projects. With exposure to volatile fossil fuel costs, increasing concern about carbon emissions and a variety of other factors, customers are seeking alternatives to traditional sources of electricity generation. We expect the coal and nuclear energy segments will continue to face regulatory and economic headwinds. As a form of electricity generation that is not dependent on fossil fuels, does not produce greenhouse gas emissions and whose costs are falling, solar energy is well-positioned to continue to capture an increasing share of this new build capacity. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this increased demand for solar energy .  
 Government Incentives 
   Our Sponsors benefit from certain U.S. government incentives designed to promote the development and use of solar energy. These incentives include accelerated tax depreciation, investment tax credits ( ITCs ), Renewable Portfolio Standards ( RPS ) programs and net metering policies. These incentives make the development of solar energy projects more competitive by providing tax credits and accelerated depreciation for a portion of the development and construction costs, decreasing the costs associated with developing and building such projects. In addition, these incentives create demand for renewable energy assets through RPS programs and the reduction or removal of these incentives may diminish the market for future solar energy offtake agreements and reduce the ability for solar developers to compete for future solar energy offtake agreements. A loss or reduction in such incentives could decrease the attractiveness of solar energy projects to developers, including our Sponsors, which could reduce our acquisition opportunities. For example, the ITC, a federal income tax credit for 30% of eligible basis, is scheduled to fall to 26% of eligible basis for solar projects that commence construction during 2020, 22% of eligible basis for solar projects that commence construction during

   Table of Contents   
   
  2021, and 10% of eligible basis for solar projects that commence construction during 2022 or thereaf  ter or are placed into service on or after January 1, 2024. For more information about the risks associated with these government incentives, please read Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors Government regulations providing incentives and subsidies for solar ene  rgy could change at any time and such changes may negatively impact our growth strategy  in the 2015 10-K  .   
 The projects in our Portfolio are generally unaffected by the trends discussed above, given that all of the electricity to be generated by our projects are sold under fixed-price offtake agreements, which, as of August 31, 2016, have a weighted average remaining life of approximately 20.6 years. In addition, our near-term growth strategy is also largely insulated from the trends discussed above. We expect that most of our short-term growth will come from opportunities to acquire the ROFO Projects, all of which will have executed power sale agreements .  
 Critical Accounting Policies   Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. In preparing these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates of certain amounts included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Application of accounting policies and estimates, however, involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In arriving at our critical accounting estimates, factors we consider include how accurate the estimate or assumptions have been in the past, how much the estimate or assumptions have changed and how reasonably likely such change may have a material impact. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 1 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since November 30, 2015.

    Results of Operations  

Three and Nine Months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to Three and Eight Months Ended August 31, 2015 
 Revenues 

Over 90% of our operating revenues for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 and the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015 were comprised of lease revenue from our utility-scale assets, C I assets and residential portfolio. The Partnership s only revenue stream not from the leasing of solar power systems is from performance based incentives ( PBI ) rebates.  All revenues for the periods presented were generated in the United States. 
   Residential systems are leased under lease agreements which are classified for accounting purposes either as sales-type leases or operating leases. As all the leases owned by the Predecessor have been placed into service prior to fiscal 2015, all revenue related to

   Table of Contents   
   
  the net present value of the minimum lease payments for sales-type leases has been recognized as of December 28, 2014. Accordingly, other than interest revenue, we had no sales-type lease revenue on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial   statements for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 and the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015.  
 For those residential leases classified as sales-type leases, the net present value of the minimum lease payments, net of executory costs, is recognized as revenue when the leased asset is placed in service. Executory costs represent estimated lease operation and maintenance costs, including insurance, to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon. This net present value is inclusive of certain fixed and determinable state or local rebates, described below, defined in the lease document as part of minimum lease payments. The difference between the net amount and the gross amount of a sales-type lease is amortized as revenue over the lease term using the interest method. Revenue from executory costs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms, almost all of which are 20 years. 
 For those residential leases classified as operating leases, revenue associated with renting the solar power system and related executory costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms, almost all of which are 20 years. We do not record certain fixed and determinable state or local rebates. Previously, certain of these fixed and determinable state or local rebates, described below, defined in the lease document as part of minimum lease payments, were recorded as deferred revenue in the Predecessor s balance sheets when the lease was placed in service and amortized to revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
 State or local rebates that are fixed and determinable are recognized when the related solar power system is placed in service. PBI rebates are not fixed and determinable, since they relate to the generation of electricity from the leased solar power system, and are recognized as revenue upon cash receipt for both sales-type leases and operating leases.  
 Total revenues increased by $23.0 million, or 749%, during the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015, and increased by $40.1 million, or 605%, during the nine months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the eight months ended August 31, 2015, due to the commencement of operations of the IPO Project Entities as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and revenues generated from the Kingbird Project and the Hooper Project acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.  
 Operating Costs and Expenses 

Cost of Operations : Cost of operations primarily includes expenses related to O M agreements and land lease expenses post IPO. The Predecessor s cost of operations additionally includes costs related to system output performance warranty and residential lease system repairs accrual and reserves for upfront rebate receivables.   
 The increase of $1.9 million, or 2,541%, for the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015 is primarily driven by increased expenses for O M, electricity and property insurance associated with operating the solar power systems due to the commencement of operations of the IPO Project Entities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the Kingbird Project and the Hooper Project acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.  
   The increase of $2.6 million, or 107%, for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the eight months ended August 31, 2015 is primarily driven by: (i) increased expenses associated with operating the solar power systems due to the commencement of operations of the IPO Project Entities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the Kingbird Project and the Hooper Project acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2016; and (ii) the reclassification of Quinto land lease expense from SG A expense by

   Table of Contents   
   
  the Predecessor prior to IPO to cost of operations post-IPO. These increases were partially offset by the Predecessor s expenses during the first quarter of 2015 that were not recorded in 2016, r  elating to: (i) a $1.3 million reserve for aged rebates receivable; (ii) a $0.5 million accrual for system output performance warranty and residential lease system repairs; and (iii) a $0.2 million accrual for a performance guarantee settlement  .    
 Cost of Operations SunPower, prior to IPO : Cost of operations SunPower, prior to IPO, represents executory costs that were allocated to the Predecessor by SunPower. Costs incurred for these services were zero for both the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $0.1 million and $0.5 million for the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, respectively.    
 Selling, General and Administrative :   SG A expense includes (i) post-IPO operating expenses such as audit, legal, insurance, independent board of directors and fees under the AMAs and MSAs with our Sponsors; (ii) charges that were incurred by SunPower that were specifically identified as attributable to the Predecessor; and (iii) an allocation of SunPower operating expenses based on the proportional level of effort attributable to the operation of the Predecessor s portfolio of solar power systems leased to residential homeowners and solar energy projects under construction. The allocated SunPower operating expenses include asset management, legal, accounting, tax, treasury, information technology, insurance, employee benefit costs, human resources, procurement, and other corporate services and infrastructure costs  .  
 The decrease of $0.7 million, or 27%, for the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015 was due to higher SG A expenses in the three months ended August 31, 2015 primarily driven by: (i)  $0.8 million allocated SunPower operating expenses based on the proportional level of effort attributable to the Quinto, RPU, UC Davis and Macy s California Projects under construction, of which the Quinto Project was approximately 95.8% complete as of August 31, 2015; and (ii) $0.2 million of allocated costs incurred by SunPower related to our IPO ; partially offset by $0.3 million higher SG A expenses in the three months ended August 31, 2016 comprised of normal operating expenditures, including fees associated with the MSAs and AMAs as well as audit, consulting, legal, insurance and independent board of director services .  
 The decrease of $4.0 million, or 44%, for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the eight months ended August 31, 2015 was due to higher SG A expenses in the eight months ended August 31, 2015 primarily driven by: (i)  $4.8 million allocated SunPower operating expenses based on the proportional level of effort attributable to the Quinto, RPU, UC Davis and Macy s California Projects under construction; (ii)  $1.6 million of allocated costs incurred by SunPower related to our IPO; and (iii) $0.9 million of Quinto land lease expenses ;  partially offset by $3.3 million higher SG A expenses in the nine months ended August 31, 2016 comprised of normal operating expenditures including fees associated with the MSAs and AMAs as well as audit, consulting, legal, insurance and independent board of director services. 
 Depreciation:  Depreciation expense reflects costs associated with depreciation of our solar power system assets that have been placed in service.   The increase of $5.1 million, or 438%, for the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015, and the increase of $14.0 million, or 588%, for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the eight months ended August 31, 2015, is a result of the commencement of operations of the IPO Project Entities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the Kingbird Project and the Hooper Project in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.   
 Acquisition-Related Transaction Costs:  Acquisition-related transactions costs represent legal and consulting fees incurred in connection with the Kern Phase 1(a) Acquisition in January 2016, the Kingbird Acquisition in March 2016, the Hooper Acquisition in April 2016 and the Macy s Maryland Acquisition in July 2016.

    Interest Expense:   On June 5, 2015, we entered into a   $525.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $300.0 million term loan facility, a $25.0 million delayed draw term loan facility and a $200.0 million revolvi  ng credit facility.   We borrowed $300.0 million under the term loan facility on June 5, 2015 to pay distributions to our Sponsors. On March 30, 2016, we drew   down $40.0 million from our revolving credit facility and $25.0 million from our delayed draw term   loan facility to pay for the Kingbird Acquisition and the Hooper Acquisition.   Loans outstanding under the senior secured credit facility bear interest and the unused portion of the revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility bear commitme  nt fees which are cash interest expenses. Please read Part I, Item 1.  Financial Information Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7  Debt and Financing Obligations  for rates. The debt discount and incremental debt issuance c  osts associated with these borrowings are non-cash interest expenses. The interest incurred related to our projects that are under construction is not reflected as an expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as it is capital  ized to construction-in-progress until the solar power system is ready for its intended use.  
 Cash interest expense in the nine months ended August 31, 2016 relates to the term loan facility, delayed draw term loan facility, revolver fees and letter of credit fees. Cash interest expense in the eight months ended August 31, 2015 relates to the term loan facility and letter of credit fees as well as financing fees due to two third-party investors for undrawn commitment of the financing arrangements described below. Non-cash interest expense in the nine months ended August 31, 2016 relates to debt issuance costs associated with our term loan facility, delayed draw term loan facility and revolver. Non-cash interest expense in the eight months ended August 31, 2015 relates to our term loan facility and two financing arrangements under which leased solar power systems were financed by two third-party investors.  
 The Predecessor terminated one residential lease financing obligation in January 2015 and the remaining obligation in May 2015. Under the terms of these financing arrangements, the investors provided upfront payments to the Predecessor, for which the Predecessor recognized as a financing obligation that was reduced over the specified term of the arrangement as customer receivables and federal cash grants were received by the third-party investors. Non-cash interest expense was recognized on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations using the effective interest rate method calculated at a rate of approximately 14-15% during the first half of fiscal 2015. 
 Interest expense for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 included non-cash interest expense of $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, and cash interest expense of $3.1 million and $8.7 million, respectively. Interest expense for the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015 included non-cash interest expense of $0.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, and cash interest expense of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.  
 Interest Income:   Interest income was $0.3 million and $0.9 million for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016, respectively, and $0.2 million and $1.2 million for the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, respectively. Interest income represents the accrued interest on reimbursable network upgrade costs related to the Quinto Project and the Kingbird Project. These costs plus accrued interest are reimbursable by the utility company over five years when the projects achieve commercial operation.  
 Other Expense (Income):  Other income in the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 primarily relates to an unrealized gain on interest rate swap associated with our term loan facility of $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, further described below.    Other expense for the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015 included: (i) a $0.8 million unrealized loss   on interest rate swap associated with our term loan facility further described below; (ii)   a loss on cash flow hedges associated with Predecessor of $2.7 million and $5.4 million, respectively, further described below; and (iii) a loss on termination of financing obligation of zero and $6.5 million, respectively, further described below.  
 Gain (loss) on interest rate swap associated with term loan facility:  On July 17, 2015, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to economically hedge the cash flows on our term loan facility. The changes in fair value are recorded in other expense (income), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations as these hedges are not accounted for under hedge accounting. During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016, we recorded an unrealized gain of $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for the mark-to-market valuation adjustment of interest rate swap agreements, as compared to the unrealized loss of $0.8 million recorded in both the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015.

    Loss on cash flow hedges associated with Predecessor  :   The Predecessor entered into in  terest rate swap agreements, designated as cash flow hedges, in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 28, 2014 on the outstanding and forecasted future borrowings under the Quinto Credit Facility to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates. T  he Predecessor assessed the effectiveness of these cash flow hedges at inception and on a quarterly basis. If it was determined that a derivative instrument was not highly effective or the transaction was no longer deemed probable of occurring, the Predece  ssor discontinued hedge accounting and recognized the ineffective portion in current period earnings. The hedge became ineffective in the first half of fiscal 2015 and the ineffective portion was recognized in earnings at that time. The interest swap was t  erminated upon the IPO and the remaining ineffective portion was recognized in earnings. During the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, $2.7 million and $5.4 million, respectively, was reclassified into loss on cash flow hedges within other expen  se, net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.   
 Loss on termination of financing obligation :   On January 30, 2015, the Predecessor entered into an agreement with one of the residential lease financing third-party investors that terminated the financing obligation arrangement. In conjunction with the termination of the arrangement, the Predecessor paid $10.8 million to terminate the $10.1 million outstanding financing obligation. On May 4, 2015, the Predecessor entered into a termination agreement with the remaining third-party investor, paying $29.0 million to terminate the $21.1 million outstanding financing obligation and $1.9 million accrued financing fee. During the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, zero and $6.5 million, respectively, was recognized as a loss on termination within other expense, net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
 Income Tax Provision 

Our tax rate is primarily affected by the tax impact of equity in earnings, the tax impact of noncontrolling interest, and state tax rates (net of federal benefit) in various jurisdictions, most significantly California. We included the income tax provision related to our equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees in the income tax provision line of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Our income tax provision post IPO primarily represents deferred federal and state taxes on the net income of OpCo, a non-taxable partnership, that is allocated to the Partnership (exclusive of income tax but after noncontrolling interest). The Predecessor s income tax provision, which was calculated on a separate return basis for the carve-out period, was due to minimum state income taxes. The decrease in income tax provision as a percentage of revenues for the three months ended August 31, 2016 of 19.4% compared to 22.8% for the three months ended August 31, 2015 is the result of a slower increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of 32.1% compared to the higher increase in revenue of 749%, partially offset by income before income taxes for the three months ended August 31, 2016 of $12.9 million compared to losses before income taxes of $4.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2015. 
 The increase in income tax provision as a percentage of revenues for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 of 32.7% compared to 10.7% for the eight months ended August 31, 2015 is the result of an increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates as well as income before income taxes for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 of $10.4 million compared to losses before income taxes of $20.8 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015.

    Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Investees  

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees represents our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from SG2 Holdings, North Star Holdings and Lost Hills Blackwell Holdings. We own a 49% ownership interest in each of SG2 Holdings, North Star Holdings and Lost Hills Blackwell Holdings, and an affiliate of Southern Company, which is not affiliated with us, owns the other 51% ownership interest. The minority membership interests are accounted for as equity method investments. 
 During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016, we recognized equity in earnings of $8.1 million and $13.5 million, respectively, which represented the entire three and nine month periods in the fiscal year 2016. During both the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015, we recognized equity in earnings of $6.1 million, which represented the period from June 24, 2015 to August 31, 2015.  
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 

Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 included a net loss of $24.3 million and $112.1 million, respectively, attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests related to our tax equity financing facilities with third-party investors under which the parties invest in entities that hold the solar power systems, offset by net income of $32.6 million and $97.9 million, respectively, attributable to our Sponsors as a result of their economic ownership in OpCo.  
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests for both the three and eight months ended August 31, 2015 included a net loss of $0.7 million attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests related to our tax equity financing facilities with third-party investors under which the parties invest in entities that hold the solar power systems, offset by net income of $4.4 million attributable to our Sponsors as a result of their economic ownership in OpCo.  
 We apply the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value ( HLBV ) Method in allocating recorded net loss to each tax equity investor based on the change during the reporting period of the amount of net assets of the entity to which each tax equity investor would be entitled under the governing contractual arrangements in a liquidation scenario. If the redemption value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests exceeds their carrying value after attribution of income (loss) under the HLBV method in any period, we will make an additional attribution of income to our redeemable noncontrolling interests such that their carrying value will at least equal the redemption value.

    Cash Flows  
 Nine Months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to Eight Months Ended August 31, 2015 
 A summary of the sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents is as follows: 

Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 was $37.8 million and was primarily the result of: (i) $15.1 million in cash distributions received from equity method investees that were classified in operating activities as returns on the investments; (ii) net income of $8.7 million; (iii) adjustments for non-cash charges of $32.5 million, including $16.3 million depreciation of operating lease assets and solar power systems, $15.3 million deferred income taxes expense, $0.2 million share-based compensation, $0.4 million amortization of debt issuance costs, and $0.3 million bad debt expense related to residential lease customers; (iv) $0.8 million increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities; and (v) $0.5 million increase in deferred revenue from the Maryland Solar Project. These inflows were partially offset by: (i) adjustments for non-cash income of $14.0 million, including $13.5 million equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees and $0.5 million mark-to-market gain on interest rate swaps; (ii) $4.3 million increase in accounts receivable and short-term financing receivables, net; and (iii) $1.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the eight months ended August 31, 2015 was $7.3 million and was primarily the result of: (i) a net loss of $15.4 million; (ii) a $6.1 million non-cash adjustment for equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees; and (iii) $4.2 million increase in prepaid and other current assets, related to capitalized expenses incurred by the Predecessor for our IPO. This was partially offset by: (i) non-cash charges of $16.1 million, including a $3.2 million mark-to-market loss on cash flow hedges, $6.5 million loss upon termination of residential financing arrangement, $2.4 million depreciation of operating lease assets and utility solar power systems, $1.3 million reserve for rebates receivable, $1.2 million interest expense for the financing arrangement of residential leased solar power systems prior to termination, $0.7 million charge for deferred income taxes, and $0.8 million unrealized loss on interest rate swaps; (ii) $1.6 million increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities; (iii) $0.4 million increase in deferred revenue on operating leases; and (iv) $0.2 million decrease in solar power systems to be leased. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 was $122.3 million and was primarily the result of $124.3 million net cash paid for the acquisitions of the Kern Phase 1(a) Assets, the Kingbird Project, the Hooper Project and the Macy s Maryland Project. These outflows were partially offset by $0.6 million of cash distributions from unconsolidated investees classified in investing activities as returns of the investments, and $1.4 million of net cash provided by purchases of property and equipment, which primarily consists of collections of test energy billings. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the eight months ended August 31, 2015 was $220.6 million and was primarily the result of $225.2 million related to costs incurred by the Predecessor associated with solar energy projects under construction. These costs were partially offset by $4.7 million of cash distributions from unconsolidated investees. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 was $57.5 million and was primarily the result of: (i) $65.0 million proceeds from issuance of bank loans, net of issuance costs, including $40.0 million from the revolving credit facility and $25.0 million from the delayed draw term loan facility; (ii) $10.0 million in capital contributions from SunPower as an indemnity per the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement for a short-fall associated with reimbursable costs for the Quinto Project network upgrade; and (iii) $0.3 million of cash contributions from tax equity investors. These cash inflows were partially offset by: (i) $13.5 million of cash distributions to our Class A members; (ii) $4.1 million of cash distributions to tax equity investors; and (iii) $0.2 million of equity issuance costs.

   Table of Contents   
   
    Net cash provided by financing activities   for the eight months ended August 31, 2015 was $271.2 million due to: (i) $393.8 million in proceeds from issuance of Class A shares, net of issuance costs; (ii) $461.2 million in proceeds from issuance of bank loans, net of issuance costs from our term lo  an facility as well as a financing arrangement for the Quinto Project; (iii) $337.8 million in capital contributions from SunPower to fund the IPO SunPower Project Entities; and (iv) $7.0 million in cash contributions from noncontrolling interests associat  ed with our tax equity financing arrangements. These cash inflows were partially offset by: (i) $371.5 million of cash distribution to SunPower as a Sponsor in connection with the IPO; (ii) $283.7 million of cash distribution to First Solar as a Sponsor in   connection with the IPO; (iii) $264.1 million repayment of bank loans to terminate two residential lease financing arrangements prior to the IPO and the Quinto Project at the IPO closing; (iv) $3.2 million of capital distributions to SunPower made by the   Predecessor before the IPO; and (v) $6.0 million of cash distribution to SunPower for the remaining purchase price payments of the IPO SunPower Project Entities.  
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity as of August 31, 2016 was $131.3 million consisting of $29.9 million cash on hand and $101.4 million of available capacity under our five-year revolving credit facility. On September 30, 2016, OpCo entered into an amendment and joinder agreement (the  Joinder Agreement ) under our existing credit facility, pursuant to which OpCo obtained a new $250.0 million incremental term loan facility, increasing the maximum borrowing capacity under the credit facility from $525.0 million to $775.0 million. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash on hand, cash generated from operations (excluding cash distributions to minority investors), distributions and dividends from the operations of our equity investments, borrowings under new and existing financing arrangements (the aggregate amount of which may be lower because of our reduced ownership in projects subject to tax equity financing) and the issuance of additional equity securities as appropriate given market conditions. We may also incur debt at the project level, which may be limited by the rights of our tax equity investors. We expect that these sources of funds will be adequate to provide for our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, as well as make acquisitions, will depend on our future operating performance which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. 
 We believe that we will have sufficient borrowings available under our revolving credit facility, liquid assets and cash flows from operations to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies and anticipated required capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Additionally, we have an active shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the issuance of additional equity securities as appropriate given market conditions. On September 28, 2016, we sold 8,050,000 Class A shares in the Public Offering pursuant to our active shelf registration statement. 
 Term Loan, Delayed Draw Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility 
 On June 5, 2015, OpCo entered into a $525.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $300.0 million term loan facility, a $25.0 million delayed draw term loan facility and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility. The delayed draw term loan facility was available to us during the 12-month period following the closing of our IPO. The proceeds of the term loan facility were used to pay fees and expenses, to repay existing indebtedness, to make a distribution to the Sponsors and for general purposes, including to fund acquisition opportunities, while the proceeds of the delayed draw term loan facility are expected to be used for acquisitions. Amounts available under the revolving facility are expected to be used for capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments, to provide for ongoing working capital requirements, and for general corporate purposes, with letters of credit issued thereunder to be used for credit support and general corporate purposes. The credit facility will mature in June 2020, five years following the closing of our IPO. 
 As of November 30, 2015, the full amount of the $300.0 million term loan facility and approximately $48.8 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility were outstanding. On March 30, 2016, in connection with the Kingbird Acquisition and the Hooper Acquisition, OpCo drew down $40.0 million from its revolving credit facility and $25.0 million from its delayed draw term loan facility.  As of August 31, 2016, the full amount of the $300.0 million term loan facility, the full amount of the $25.0 million delayed draw term loan facility, $40.0 million of the revolving credit facility, and approximately $58.6 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility were outstanding. The remaining portion from the revolving credit facility was undrawn.   
   In general, the credit facility contains representations, warranties, covenants (including financial covenants) and defaults that are customary for this type of financing; provided, however, that OpCo is permitted to pay distributions to its unitholders and we are

   Table of Contents   
   
  permitted to pay distributions to our shareholders out of available cash so long as no default or event of default under the credit facility has occurred or is continuing at the time of such distribution, or would result therefrom  , and OpCo is otherwise in compliance, on a pro forma basis, with the facility s covenants requiring it to maintain its debt to cash flow ratio and debt service coverage ratio (as such financial ratios are described below). Among other things, events of de  faults that could result in restrictions on our ability to make such distributions include certain failures to make payments when due under the credit facility, certain defaults under other agreements, breaches of certain covenants and representations unde  r the credit facility, commencement of certain insolvency proceedings, the existence of certain judgments or attachments, certain orders of dissolution of loan parties, certain events relating to employee benefit plans, the occurrence of a change of contro  l (as more fully described below), certain events relating to the effectiveness and validity of the guaranties and collateral documents in support of the credit facility (as described below) and other credit documents and, under certain circumstances, the   termination of the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement or the Quinto PPA. Loans outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at either (i) a base rate, which is the highest of (x) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (y) the administrative agent s   prime rate and (z) one-month LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable margin; or (ii) one-, two-, three- or six-month LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The unused portion of the revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility is subject to a co  mmitment fee of 0.30% per annum. OpCo may prepay the borrowings under the term loan facility and the delayed draw term loan facility at any time. In the future, we may increase our debt to fund our operations or future acquisitions.  
 OpCo s credit facility is secured by a pledge over the equity of OpCo and certain of its domestic subsidiaries. The Partnership and each of OpCo s domestic subsidiaries, other than certain non-guarantor subsidiaries, have guaranteed the obligations of OpCo under the credit facility.  
 OpCo s credit facility also contains covenants requiring us to maintain the following financial ratios: (i) a debt to cash flow ratio (as more fully defined in the credit facility) of not more than (a) 5.50 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending August 31, 2016 through May 31, 2017, and (b) 5.00 to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter; and (ii) a debt service coverage ratio (as more fully defined in the credit facility) of not less than 1.75 to 1.00. In addition, an event of default occurs under the credit facility upon a change of control. The credit facility defines a change of control as occurring when, among other things, (i) the Sponsors (or either of them) cease to direct the management, directly or indirectly, of us or OpCo, or (ii) the Sponsors collectively cease to own 35% of the economic interest in OpCo. In addition, the credit facility contains customary non-financial covenants and certain restrictions that will limit the Partnership s, OpCo s and certain of the Partnership s and its domestic subsidiaries  ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional debt and to make distributions on or redeem or repurchase OpCo common units.  As of August 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the debt covenants.  
 On April 6, 2016, the parties thereto amended OpCo s credit facility (i) to provide for the lenders  consent to the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement, to expand OpCo s ability to further amend the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement without lender consent in the future, subject to certain conditions, (iii) to permit certain customary restrictions on transfers of the equity interests of certain Project Entities, which are jointly owned, indirectly, by OpCo and SunPower, (iv) to supplement the Pledge and Security Agreement between the parties in light of the foregoing amendment, and (v) to make certain clarifying modifications to definitions and cross references.  
 Subject to certain conditions, the credit facility includes conditional borrowing capacity for incremental commitments to increase the term loan facility and revolving credit facility by $250.0 million, with any increase in the revolving facility not to exceed $100.0 million.  On September 30, 2016, OpCo entered into the Joinder Agreement under its existing senior secured credit facility, pursuant to which OpCo obtained a new $250.0 million incremental term loan facility, increasing the maximum borrowing capacity under the credit facility to $775.0 million. The Joinder Agreement also amends OpCo s credit facility to, among other things, (i) permit OpCo to incur up to $50.0 million in subordinated indebtedness from First Solar or its affiliate to pay a portion of the purchase price for the potential acquisition of an interest in a solar energy project located in San Bernardino County, California, that has a nameplate capacity of 300 MW (the  Stateline Project ), and (ii) increase OpCo s maximum debt-to-cash-flow ratio (as more fully defined in the OpCo s credit facility) in respect of the fiscal quarters ending November 30, 2016 through November 30, 2017 from 5.50:1.00 to 6.00:1.00, and for all fiscal quarters thereafter from 5.00:1.00 to 5.50:1.00 (except that the prior thresholds will continue to apply under certain circumstances).  All other existing terms of OpCo s senior secured credit facility remain unchanged.

    Tax Equity  
 Our projects are, and our future acquisitions are expected to be, subject to two types of tax equity financing. In the first type of tax equity financing, the governing agreements provide, and the governing agreements of our future acquisitions may provide, our tax equity investors with a number of minority investor protection rights with respect to the applicable asset or assets that have been financed with tax equity, including restricting the ability of the entity that owns such asset or assets to incur debt. To the extent we want to incur project-level debt at a project in which we co-invest with a tax equity investor, we may be required to obtain the tax equity investor s consent prior to such incurrence. In addition, the amount of debt that could be incurred by an entity in which we have a tax equity co-investor may be further constrained because even if the tax equity investor consents to the incurrence of the debt at the entity or project level, the tax equity investor may not agree to pledge its interest in the project which could reduce the amount that can be borrowed and raise the cost of borrowing by the entity. 
 In the second type of tax equity financing, the governing agreements provide, and the governing agreements of our future acquisitions may provide, our tax equity investors with a majority interest in the project. In such agreements, we will only have a number of minority investor protection rights with respect to the applicable asset or assets that have been financed with tax equity, including restricting the ability of the entity that owns such asset or assets to incur debt. In most cases, since we are not the majority owner, we will not be able to direct the actions of the entity that owns such asset. As such, we may not be able to incur debt at the entity or project level, without the consent of the majority owner. 
 Uses of Liquidity 
 Our principal requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating our business, can generally be categorized into the following: (i) debt service obligations; (ii) funding acquisitions, if any; and (iii) cash distributions to shareholders. Generally, once COD is reached, solar energy generation assets do not require significant capital expenditures to maintain operating performance.

    Contractual Obligations  
 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of August 31, 2016:  

(1)   
 
 Land use commitments primarily relate to a non-cancellable operating lease for the Quinto Project and two operating leases for the Kingbird Project, and are equal to the minimum lease and easement payments to landowners for the right to use the land upon which solar power systems are located.    

(2)   
 
 Includes $300.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility entered into by OpCo on June 5, 2015 (in connection with our IPO) which will mature on or about the fifth anniversary of its issuance, at which point all amounts outstanding under the term loan facility will become due. From August 31, 2016 to August 31, 2018, which is the term of the interest rate swap, the interest payments are estimated based on the fixed swap interest rate of 0.85% plus the 2% margin for the notional amount of $250.0 million. The interest payments for the remaining $50.0 million notional amount through the maturity of the term loan, and the full amount outstanding thereafter, are estimated based on the floating cash interest rate of approximately 2.52% per annum effective as of August 31, 2016.    

(3)   
 
 Includes $25.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the delayed draw term loan facility and $40.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility entered into by OpCo on June 5, 2015 (in connection with the Kingbird Acquisition and the Hooper Acquisition), which will mature on or about the fifth anniversary of the issuance of the term loan facility, at which point all amounts outstanding under the delayed draw term loan facility and the revolving credit facility will become due. The interest payments for the $65.0 million notional amount through the maturity date, and the full amount outstanding thereafter, are estimated based on the floating cash interest rate of approximately 2.52% per annum effective as of August 31, 2016.    

 Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
 As of August 31, 2016, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements.

        Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati  ve Disclosures About Market Risk.  
 We are exposed to several market risks in our normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with our business or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of market risks to which we are exposed include credit risk and interest rate risk. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by offtake counterparties under the terms of their contractual obligations, thereby impacting the amount and timing of expected cash flows. We monitor and manage credit risk through credit policies that include a credit approval process and the use of credit mitigation measures such as having a diversified portfolio of offtake counterparties. However, there are a limited number of offtake counterparties under offtake agreements, which offtake counterparties are entities engaged in the energy industry, and this concentration may impact the overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the offtake counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. If any of these offtake agreement customers  receivable balances in the future should be deemed uncollectible, it could have a material adverse effect on our forecasted cash flows. 
 The concentration of credit risk under the residential lease program is limited because customers are required to have a minimum FICO credit score at the time of initial contract, the existing customer base is of high credit quality with an average FICO credit score of 765 at the time of initial contract, the program has a large number of customers with small account balances for each, and the customers are diversified geographically within the United States. As of August 31, 2016, we do not believe we had significant credit risk because of the creditworthiness of the offtake counterparties. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk because we depend on debt financing to purchase our projects. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for us to obtain the financing necessary to purchase our projects on favorable terms, or at all, and thus reduce revenue and adversely impact our operating results. An increase in interest rates could lower our return on investment in a project and adversely impact our operating results. This risk is significant to our business because our growth is highly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and the availability of credit, and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates or liquidity constraints. 
 Our interest expense would increase to the extent interest rates rise in connection with our variable interest rate borrowings. As of August 31, 2016, the outstanding principal balance of our variable interest borrowings was $365.0 million of which $115.0 million is unhedged. An immediate 10% increase in interest rates would have an increase of approximately $0.1 million of annualized interest expenses on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. This increase was mitigated by interest rate swaps that we entered into on August 31, 2016 in connection with our term loan facility which covered $250.0 million of the $365.0 million outstanding principal balance. As of August 31, 2016, our investment portfolio consisted of 100% in demand deposits. 
 In addition, increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of our Class A shares, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make cash distributions at our intended levels. As with other yield-oriented securities, our share price is impacted by our level of cash distributions and implied distribution yield. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on the price of our Class A shares, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make cash distributions at our intended levels.

        Item 4. Controls   and Procedures.  
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in  Securities and Exchange Commission  rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure control and procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of August 31, 2016 at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   P  ART II OTHER INFORMATION 
     Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 None. 
     Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors we previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  of  the 2015 10-K . The risks described in the 2015 10-K are not the only risks facing the Partnership.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Partnership, or that are currently deemed to be immaterial, also may materially adversely affect the Partnership s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash available for distribution and prospects.
