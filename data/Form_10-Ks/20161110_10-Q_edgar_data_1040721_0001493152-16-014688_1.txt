SPECIAL
NOTE ON FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS   

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations  in Item 2 of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking
statements.  

In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   should,   expects, 
 plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential, 
 proposed,   intended,  or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.
You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss our expectations about our future operating
results or our future financial condition or state other  forward-looking  information. There may be events in the
future that we are not able to accurately predict or control. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the
occurrence of any of the events described in this Quarterly Report could substantially harm our business, results of operations
and financial condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline
and you could lose all or part of your investment. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, growth rates, levels of activity, performance or achievements.
We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these
statements to actual results.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with both accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Certain information and notes disclosures normally included in audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes
that the disclosure made are adequate to make the information not misleading.  

In
the opinion of management, the balance sheet as of June 30, 2016 which has been derived from audited financial statements and
these unaudited condensed financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary to state fairly
the results for the periods presented. The results for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 2017 or for any future period.  

These
unaudited condensed financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Management s Discussion
and the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30,
2016.  

2.
ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   

Wincash
Apolo Gold   Energy, Inc. ( the Company ) was incorporated in March of 1997 under the laws of the State of Nevada
primarily for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties.  

On
September 17, 2014, the Company terminated the Asset Sale   Purchase Agreements with Mr. Tang and Mr. Hu for the acquisition
of 24% and 29% equity interest and assets in Everenergy, respectively due to neither Mr. Tang, Mr. Hu or Everenergy had complied
various terms and conditions of the Asset Sale   Purchase Agreement. On the same day, the Board of Directors approved the
cancellation of the total 19,000,000 shares of restricted common stock at the current market value of $0.12 per share. On October
21, 2014, 11,000,000 shares were returned and effectively cancelled and the Company continues to pursue the return and cancellation
of the remaining 8,000,000 shares. Subsequent on October 16, 2016, the Company received and cancelled 6,208,655 shares.  

On
February 13, 2015, the Company disposed its 100% equity interest in Apolo Gold Direct Limited (formerly known as Apolo Gold  
Energy Asia Limited) to (i) Mr. Tommy Tsap Wai Ping, the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and director of the Company,
who acquired 50% equity interest, (ii) Mr. Kelvin Chak Wai Man, a relative of the CEO of the Company, who acquired 40% equity
interest, and (iii) China Yi Gao Gold Trader Co., Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, which acquired the remaining 10%
equity interest, for a consideration of $100.  

On
June 18, 2015, the Company filed an Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change its
name from Apolo Gold   Energy, Inc. to Wincash Apolo Gold   Energy, Inc.  

The
Company will continue to anticipate potential mineral property exploration and other energy related investments. As of September
30, 2016, the Company does not hold any mineral property exploration claims.

THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES   

These
condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern which contemplates
the realization of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has suffered the accumulated deficits of $16,072,978 from prior years and with working capital
deficit of $93,612. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continuing financial support from
its stockholders or external financing. Management believes the existing stockholders will provide the additional cash to meet
with the Company s obligations as they become due. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain
sufficient funds to meet its obligations.  

These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the
amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
accompanying condensed financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in
this note and elsewhere in the accompanying condensed financial statements and notes.  

Use
of estimates   

Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these condensed financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities in the balance sheet, and the revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.  

Cash
and cash equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.  

Stock-based
compensation  

The
Company adopts FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation ( ASC Topic 718 )
using the fair value method. Under ASC Topic 718, the stock-based compensation is measured using the Black-Scholes Option-Pricing
model on the date of grant under the modified prospective method. The fair value of stock-based compensation that are expected
to vest are recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period. For the three months ended September
30, 2016, the Company amortized $4,000 to the operations using the straight-line method.

THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    

   (Currency
expressed in United States Dollars ( US$ ), except for number of shares)   

   (Unaudited)   

Income
taxes   

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes  ( ASC Topic 740 ).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized
in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant
facts.  

Net
loss per share   

The
Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share.  Basic loss per share
is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income
per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional
common shares were dilutive.  

Related
parties   

Parties,
which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly,
to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions.
Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.

Fair
value of financial instruments   

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, prepayments, other payables and accrued
liabilities, and amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial
instruments.  

The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820-10 ),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level
    1:  
      Observable
    inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;   

Level
    2:  
      Inputs,
    other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and   

Level
    3:  
       Unobservable
                                         inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity
                                         to develop its own assumptions.    

Fair
value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These
estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined
with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.  

Foreign
currency translation   

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting
exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.  

The
reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars ( US$ ) and the accompanying condensed financial statements
have been expressed in US$.  

Recent
accounting pronouncements   

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption
of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

AMOUNT DUE TO A DIRECTOR   

As
of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the director of the Company has advanced $65,500 and $44,300, respectively for the payment
of administrative expenses. The amount is unsecured, bears no interest and is payable upon demand. Imputed interest is considered
insignificant.  

5.
COMMON STOCK   

On
December 1, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved to issue 200,000 shares of restricted common stock at $0.08 per
share for the rendering of consulting services of $16,000 in a service period of twelve months commencing from December 2015.
For the three months ended September 30, 2016, all 200,000 shares have been issued and the Company amortized $4,000 to the operations
using the straight-line method.  

There
were no stock options, warrants or other potentially dilutive securities outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  

As
of September 30, 2016, there were 22,072,118 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.  

6.
INCOME TAX   

The
Company is registered in the State of Nevada and is subject to the tax laws of the United States of America. For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred an operating loss of $22,152. As of September 30, 2016, the operations in the United
States of America incurred $16,072,978 of cumulative net operating losses which can be carried forward to offset future taxable
income. The net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in the year 2017 through 2034, if unutilized. The Company has provided
for a full valuation allowance of $5,625,542 against the deferred tax assets on the expected future tax benefits from the net
operating loss carryforwards as the management believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized in the
future.  

7.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

For
the three month ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company paid $6,000 and $3,750, respectively to a company controlled by
an officer of the Company for accounting services.  

The
related party transactions are generally transacted in an arm-length basis at the current market value in the normal course of
business.  

8.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has no commitments or contingencies involved.  

9.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

In
accordance with ASC Topic 855,  Subsequent Events , which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure

History   

Apolo
Gold   Energy Inc. ( Company ) was incorporated in March 1997 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Its objective
was to pursue mineral properties in South America, Central America, North America and Asia. The Company incorporated a subsidiary
- Compania Minera Apologold, C.A in Venezuela to develop a gold/diamond mining concession in Southeastern Venezuela. Project was
terminated in August 2001, due to poor testing results and the property abandoned. This subsidiary company has been inactive since
2001 and will not be reactivated.  

On
April 16, 2002, the Company announced the acquisition of the mining rights to a property known as the Napal Gold Property, ( NUP ).
This property is located 48 km south-west of Bandar Lampung, Sumatra, Indonesia. The property consisted of 733.9 hectares and
possessed a Production Permit (a KP) # KW. 098PP325.  

The
terms of the Napal Gold Property called for a total payment of $375,000 US over a six-year period of which a total of $250,000
have been made to date. Company paid $250,000 over the past 5 years and subsequent to the year ending June 30, 2008 the Company
terminated its agreement on the NUP property and returned all exploration rights to the owner.  

On
December 11, 2013, the Company acquired 70% interest in three gold exploration claims located in China s Xinjiang Province
from Yinfu Gold Corp. ( Yinfu ). The Company issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted common stock for the claims at
$0.20 per share for the consideration of $1,200,000. On January 19, 2015, the Company and Yinfu reached a mutual agreement to
terminate the acquisition at the current market value of $0.10 per share and therefore an investment loss of $600,000 was resulted.
On February 3, 2015, all 6,000,000 shares of restricted common stock were returned and effectively cancelled.  

On
December 23, 2013, the Company acquired 24% interest in Jiangxi Everenergy New Material Co., Ltd. ( Everenergy ) for
a consideration of $4,000,000. The consideration was settled with the issuance of 8,000,000 shares of restricted common stock
at a deemed price of $0.375 per share, plus $1,000,000 in cash.  

On
February 19, 2014, the Company acquired an additional 29% interest in Everenergy for a consideration of $4,950,000. The consideration
was settled with the issuance of 11,000,000 shares of restricted common stock at a deemed price of $0.45 per share.  

On
September 17, 2014, the Company cancelled both transactions with Everenergy at the current market value of $0.12 per share and
requested the return of $1,000,000 cash payment. The 11,000,000 shares were effectively cancelled on October 21, 2014 and the
Company continues to pursue the return and cancellation of the remaining 8,000,000 shares. On October 16, 2016, the Company received
and cancelled 6,208,655 shares. For the year ended June 30, 2015, the Company could not recover the $1,000,000 cash payment and
therefore a total investment loss of $6,670,000 was resulted.  

On
February 13, 2015, the Company disposed its 100% equity interest in Apolo Gold Direct Limited (formerly known as Apolo Gold  
Energy Asia Limited) to (i) Mr. Tommy Tsap Wai Ping, who acquired 50% equity interest. Mr. Tsap Wai Ping became the Chief Executive
Officer ( CEO ) and director of the Company on December 1, 2015. (ii) Mr. Kelvin Chak Wai Man, the former president,
CEO and director of the Company and a relative of the current CEO of the Company, acquired 40% equity interest, and (iii) China
Yi Gao Gold Trader Co., Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, which acquired the remaining 10% equity interest, for a
consideration of $100.  

On
June 4, 2015, the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted common stock at $0.10 per share for the rendering of business
and strategic consulting services of $600,000 in a service period of twelve months commencing from June 2015. For the years ended

Results
of Operations   Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015   

REVENUES:
 The Company had no revenues generated for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

EXPENSES:   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred a loss of $22,152 and $17,361, respectively.  

Consulting
and professional fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $17,500 compared to $14,450 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $3,050. Among the consulting and professional fees, approximately $4,000 and $0 were
settled by stock based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The
Company continues to carefully control its expenses, and intends to seek additional financing both for potential business opportunities
it may develop. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its attempts to raise additional capital.  

The
Company has no employees in its head office at the present time other than its Officers and Directors, and engages personnel through
consulting agreements where necessary as well as outside attorneys, accountants and technical consultants.  

Cash
and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 was $10,290 (June 30, 2016 - $8,993) and the Company recognizes it may not have
sufficient funds to conduct its affairs. It fully intends to seek financing by way of loans, private placements or a combination
of both in the coming months. The Company is dependent on its directors to provide necessary funding when required.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

Cash
Used in Operating Activities    

Net
cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $19,903 and $13,906, respectively,
an increase of $5,997. The net cash used in operating activities are mainly attributed from the net loss of $22,152 incurred for
the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and offset by stock based compensation of $4,000 and increase in prepayments of $1,249.  

Cash

There
was no cash used in or generated from investing activities for three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Cash

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $21,200 and $0, respectively.
The net cash provided by financing activities are mainly attributed from the advances from the director of the Company.  

The
Company has financed its development to date by way of sale of common stock and with loans from directors/shareholders of the
Company. As of October 17, 2016, the Company had 22,072,118 shares of common stock outstanding, and has raised total capital since
inception in excess of $7,500,000.

The amounts were unsecured, interest free and have no fixed terms of repayment.

financing. The Company recognizes that it is dependent on the ability of its management team to obtain the necessary working capital
required.  

While
in the pursuit of additional working capital, the Company is also very active in reviewing other resource development opportunities
and will continue with these endeavors.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision
and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management
to conclude that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation
of duties and effective risk assessment; (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting
with respect to the requirements and applications of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines, and (iii) inadequate financial statement
closing process.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially
affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
