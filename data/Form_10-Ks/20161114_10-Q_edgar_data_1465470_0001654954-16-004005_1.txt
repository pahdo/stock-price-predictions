NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Nature of Operations 

NaturalShrimp
Incorporated is a global shrimp farming company that has developed
a technology to produce fresh, gourmet-grade shrimp reliably and
economically in an indoor, re-circulating, saltwater facility. Our
eco-friendly, bio-secure design does not rely on ocean water; it
recreates the natural ocean environment allowing for high-density
production which can be replicated anywhere in the
world. 

Our
self-contained shrimp aquiculture system allows for the production
of Pacific White (Litopenaeus vannamei, formerly Penaeus vannamei)
shrimp in an ecologically controlled fully contained and
independent production system without the use of antibiotics or
toxic chemicals. 

The
Company has developed several proprietary technology assets,
including a knowledge base that allows the production of commercial
quantities of shrimp in a closed system with a computer monitoring
system that automates, monitors and maintains proper levels of
oxygen, salinity and temperature for optimal shrimp
production. 

Our
research and development facilities are located outside of San
Antonio, Texas, and we hold a minority interest in a Norwegian
company that owns and operates a similar shrimp production facility
in Medina del Campo, Spain. 

On
November 26, 2014, Multiplayer Online Dragon, Inc., a Nevada
corporation ( MYDR ), entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement (the  Agreement ) with NaturalShrimp
Holdings, Inc. a Delaware corporation ( NSH  or the
 Company ), pursuant to which MYDR was to acquire
substantially all of the assets of NSH which assets consist
primarily of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of NaturalShrimp Corporation ( NSC ), a Delaware
corporation, and NaturalShrimp Global, Inc. ( NS
Global ), a Delaware corporation, and certain real property
located outside of San Antonio, Texas (the
 Assets ). 

On
January 30, 2015, MYDR consummated the acquisition of the Assets
pursuant to the Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the
Agreement, MYDR effected a 1 for 10 reverse stock split, decreasing
the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from
97,000,000 to 9,700,000 and MYDR issued 75,520,240 shares of its
common stock to NSH as consideration for the Assets. As a result of
the transaction, NSH acquired 88.62% of MYDR s issued and
outstanding shares of common stock, NSC and NS Global became
MYDR s wholly-owned subsidiaries, and MYDR changed its
principal business to a global shrimp farming company. All per
share amounts reflected hereafter give effect to the 1-for-10
reverse split. 

As a
result of the controlling financial interest of the former
stockholders of NSH, for financial statement reporting purposes,
the asset acquisition has been treated as a reverse acquisition
with NSH deemed the accounting acquirer and the Company deemed the
accounting acquiree under the acquisition method of accounting in
accordance with ASC 805-10-55 of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). The reverse
acquisition is deemed a capital transaction and the net assets of
NSH (the accounting acquirer) are carried forward to the Company
(the legal acquirer and the reporting entity) at their carrying
value before the acquisition. The acquisition process utilizes the
capital structure of the Company and the assets and liabilities of
NSH which are recorded at their historical cost. The equity of the
Company is the historical equity of NSH. 

In
connection with MYDR s receipt of approval from the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ), effective
March 3, 2015, MYDR amended its Articles of Incorporation to change
its name to  NaturalShrimp Incorporated  (the
 Company ). 

The
Company has two wholly owned subsidiaries including NaturalShrimp
Corporation and NaturalShrimp Global, Inc. 

As used
in this report and unless otherwise indicated, the term
 Company  refers to NaturalShrimp Incorporated and the
Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries
( Subsidiaries ). Unless otherwise specified, all
dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars.

Basis of Presentation 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have
been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles have been omitted. However, in the opinion of
management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring
adjustments, unless otherwise indicated) necessary to present
fairly the financial position and results of operations for the
periods presented have been made. The results for interim periods
are not necessarily indicative of trends or of results to be
expected for the full year. These financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company
for the year ended March 31, 2016 (including the notes thereto) set
forth on Form 10-K. The Company uses as guidance Accounting
Standard Codification (ASC) as established by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB). 

Significant Accounting Policies 

For
reference to a complete list of significant accounting policies,
these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31,
2016 (including the notes thereto) set forth on Form
10-K. 

During
the period ended September 30, 2016, there were several new
accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board. Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has
been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe
the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or
will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements. 

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT S LIQUIDITY
PLANS 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, assuming the Company will
continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of
assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. For the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
incurred losses from operations of $530,727. As of September 30,
2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $29,372,818 and a
working capital deficit of $5,346,082. These matters raise
substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent on its ability to raise the required additional capital
or debt financing to meet short and long-term operating
requirements. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company received net cash proceeds of $476,960 from the additional
issuance of debt from a related party. Management believes that
private placements of equity capital and/or additional debt
financing will be needed to fund the Company s long-term
operating requirements. The Company may also encounter business
endeavors that require significant cash commitments or
unanticipated problems or expenses that could result in a
requirement for additional cash. If the Company raises additional
funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt
securities, the percentage ownership of our current shareholders
could be reduced, and such securities might have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to the Company s common
stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable
terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not
available on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to take
advantage of prospective business endeavors or opportunities, which
could significantly and materially restrict our operations. The
Company is continuing to pursue external financing alternatives to
improve its working capital position. If the Company is unable to
obtain the necessary capital, the Company may have to cease
operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. These matters raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going
concern.

NOTE 7   FEDERAL INCOME TAX 

The
Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740-10, which provides
for an asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences, using
currently enacted tax laws, attributed to temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts calculated for income
tax purposes. 

For the
years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred net
operating losses and, accordingly, no provision for income taxes
has been recorded.  In addition, no benefit for income
taxes has been recorded due to the uncertainty of the realization
of any deferred tax assets. 

Based
on the available objective evidence, including the Company s
history of losses, management believes it is more likely than not
that any net deferred tax assets will not be fully

Corporate Overview 

We were
incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 3, 2008 under the name
 Multiplayer Online Dragon, Inc.  Effective November 5,
2010, we effected an 8 for 1 forward stock split, increasing the
issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from 12,000,000
shares to 96,000,000 shares. On October 29, 2014, we effected a 1
for 10 reverse stock split, decreasing the issued and outstanding
shares of our common stock from 97,000,000 to
9,700,000. 

On
November 26, 2014, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the
 Agreement ) with NaturalShrimp Holdings, Inc. a
Delaware corporation ( NSH ), pursuant to which we
agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of NSH which
assets consisted primarily of all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of NaturalShrimp Corporation
( NSC ), a Delaware corporation, and NaturalShrimp
Global, Inc. ( NS Global ), a Delaware corporation, and
certain real property located outside of San Antonio, Texas (the
 Assets ). 

On
January 30, 2015, we consummated the acquisition of the Assets
pursuant to the Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the
Agreement, we issued 75,520,240 shares of our common stock to NSH
as consideration for the Assets. As a result of the transaction,
NSH acquired 88.62% of our issued and outstanding shares of common
stock, NSC and NS Global became our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and
we changed our principal business to a global shrimp farming
company. 

In
connection with our receipt of approval from the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ), effective March 3,
2015, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name
to  NaturalShrimp Incorporated . 

We are
a biotechnology company and have developed a proprietary technology
that allows us to grow Pacific White shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei,
formerly Penaeus vannamei) in an ecologically controlled,
high-density, low-cost environment, and in fully contained and
independent production facilities. Our system uses technology which
allows us to produce a naturally-grown shrimp  crop 
weekly, and accomplishes this without the use of antibiotics or
toxic chemicals. We have developed several proprietary technology
assets, including a knowledge base that allows us to produce
commercial quantities of shrimp in a closed system with a computer
monitoring system that automates, monitors and maintains proper
levels of oxygen, salinity and temperature for optimal shrimp
production. Our initial production facility is located outside of
San Antonio, Texas. 

NS
Global, a wholly owned subsidiary of NaturalShrimp Incorporated.,
owns 10% of NaturalShrimp International A.S. in Europe. Our
European-based partner, NaturalShrimp International A.S., Oslo,
Norway is responsible for the construction cost of their facility
and initial operating capital. 

The
first facility built in Spain for NaturalShrimp International A.S.
is GambaNatural de Espa a, S.L. The land for the first
facility was purchased in Medina del Campo, Spain and construction
of the 75,000 sq. ft. facility and was completed in 2015. Medina
del Campo is approximately seventy-five miles northwest of Madrid,
Spain. 

Since
the middle of 2015, we have continued to develop our indoor shrimp
production system. In addition, during 2016, we have engaged in
additional engineering projects to further enhance our indoor
production capabilities. We are also working on expanding our
intellectual property with respect to such additional enhancements.
At this time, we don t expect commercial sales until late
2017, which would be limited. When production does commence,
wholesale prices for the shrimp produced by the Company are
expected to be between $9.00 to $12.00 per pound F.O.B, based on
preliminary estimates. 

On
October 16, 2015, we formed Natural Aquatic Systems, Inc.
( NAS ). The purpose of the NAS is to formalize the
business relationship between NaturalShrimp Incorporated and
F T Water Solutions LLC for the joint development of certain
water technologies. The technologies shall include, but are not
limited to, any and all inventions, patents, intellectual property
and know-how dealing with enclosed aquatic production systems
worldwide. This includes construction, operation, and management of
enclosed aquatic production, other than shrimp, facilities
throughout the world, co-developed by both parties at our facility
located outside of La Coste, Texas.

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the Six
Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Revenue 

We have
not earned any significant revenues since our inception and we do
not anticipate earning revenues in the near future. 

Expenses 

Our
expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 are summarized
as follows in comparison to our expenses for the six months ended
September 30, 2015: 

Operating
expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 were $422,060,
representing a decrease of 61% compared to operating expenses of
$1,082,620 for the same period in 2015. The primary reason for the
change is the decrease in professional fees and the decrease in
other general and administrative expenses associated with the
reverse acquisition transaction in comparison to the current
period. 

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the
Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Revenue 

We have
not earned any significant revenues since our inception and we do
not anticipate earning revenues in the near future. 

Expenses 

Our
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are
summarized as follows in comparison to our expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2015: 

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were
$192,932, representing a decrease of 65% compared to operating
expenses of $549,254 for the same period in 2015. The primary
reason for the change is the decrease in professional fees and the
decrease in other general and administrative expenses associated
with the reverse acquisition transaction in comparison to the
current period.

Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources 

As of
September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of
$112,410 and a working capital deficiency of $5,346,082, as
compared to cash equivalents on hand of $6,158 and a working
capital deficiency of $4,836,356 as of March 31, 2016. The increase
in working capital deficiency is mainly due to an increase in
accrued expenses for the period ended September 30,
2016. 

Working Capital Deficiency 

The
decrease in current assets is mainly due to a decrease of in cash
and equivalents. The increase in current liabilities is primarily
due to increase in accrued interest and notes payable to related
parties. Management is attempting raise more capital in order to
increase the Company s cash position and pay down current
liabilities. 

Cash Flows 

The
decrease in net cash used in operating activities in the six months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in September
30 2015, mainly relates to a decrease in operating expenses. The
decrease in cash provided by financing activities is mainly due to
a decrease in cash flows from financing activities, namely proceeds
from sale of common stock in the previous period reduced by
issuance of debt from a related party in the current
period. 

Our
cash position was approximately $112,410 as of September 30, 2016.
Management believes that our cash on hand and working capital are
not sufficient to meet our current anticipated cash requirements
through 2016. 

Notes Payable-Related party 

On
January 1, 2016 the Company entered into a notes payable agreement
with NaturalShrimp Holdings, Inc., a shareholder. Between January
16, 2016 and September 27, 2016 the Company borrowed $595,815 under
this agreement. The note payable has no set monthly payment or
maturity date with a stated interest rate of 2%. 

Going Concern 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in
this annual report on Form 10-Q have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has
accumulated losses through the period to September 30, 2016 of
$29,372,818, as well as negative cash flows from operating
activities. Presently, the Company does not have sufficient cash
resources to meet its plans in the twelve months following
September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management
is in the process of evaluating various financing alternatives in
order to finance our research and development activities and
general and administrative expenses. For the six months ended
September 30, 2016, our cash needs have been funded via advances
from our loan with NaturalShrimp Holdings, Inc. Other alternatives
include raising funds through public or private equity markets and
either through institutional or retail investors. Although there is
no assurance that the Company will be successful with our fund
raising initiatives, management believes that the Company will be
able to secure the necessary financing as a result of ongoing
financing discussions with third party investors and existing
shareholders. 

15 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a
going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain additional
financing as may be required and ultimately to attain
profitability. If the Company raises additional funds through the
issuance of equity, the percentage ownership of current
shareholders could be reduced, and such securities might have
rights, preferences or privileges senior to its common stock.
Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or
at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on
acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to take advantage of
prospective business endeavors or opportunities, which could
significantly and materially restrict its future plans for
developing its business and achieving commercial revenues. If the
Company is unable to obtain the necessary capital, the Company may
have to cease operations. 

Future Financing 

We will
require additional funds to implement our growth strategy for our
business. In addition, while we have received capital from various
private placements and credit lines that have enabled us to fund
our operations, these funds have been largely used to develop our
processes, although additional funds are needed for other corporate
operational and working capital purposes. Therefore, we will need
to raise an additional $5,000,000 to cover all of our expansion and
operational expenses over the next 12 months. These funds may be
raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources,
which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our
shares. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be
available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be
obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to
obtain the additional financing on a timely basis should it be
required, or generate significant material revenues from
operations, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as
they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even
cease our operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have
no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably
likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to stockholders. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in the
notes to our financial statements included herein for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 and in the notes to our consolidated
financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. We believe that the
accounting policies below are critical for one to fully understand
and evaluate our financial condition and results of
operations. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

Our
recently adopted accounting pronouncements are more fully described
in Note 1 to our financial statements included herein for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK 

Not
Applicable 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), our management carried out
an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial
Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the period
covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures are
defined as controls and other procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports
filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms and
(ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, including its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based upon their evaluation, our
management (including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016, based
on the material weaknesses defined below: 

16 

(i)           

inadequate
segregation of duties consistent with control objectives;
and 

(ii)           

ineffective
controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting
processes. 

Our
management feels the weaknesses identified above have not had any
material effect on our financial results. However, we are currently
reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these
material weaknesses and expect to implement changes in the next
fiscal year, including identifying specific areas within our
governance, accounting and financial reporting processes to add
adequate resources to potentially mitigate these material
weaknesses. 

Our
management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness
of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls
over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to
taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or
improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter
how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. 

Management
believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our
consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September
30, 2016 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance
with United States Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting
that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal controls over financial
reporting.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

An
investment in our common stock involves a number of very
significant risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors
included in the  Risk Factors  section of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 that
