    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

  (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION,
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION      

Stemcell Holdings, Inc., formerly known as
Perfect Acquisition, Inc. (the  Company ), a growth company, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
on December 31, 2015, with an objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business. On March 24, 2016, the Company entered
into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Stock Purchase Agreement ) with Takaaki Matsuoka, our President, CEO and Director.
Pursuant to this Agreement, on March 24, 2016 Takaaki Matsuoka transferred to the Company, 500 shares of the common stock of Stemcell
Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation ( Stemcell ), which represented all of its issued and outstanding shares, in consideration
of 5,000,000 JPY ($44,476). Following the effective date of the share purchase transaction above on March 24, 2016, Stemcell Holdings,
Inc. gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of Stemcell s common stock and Stemcell became a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company conducts a regenerative medicine-related business which includes but is not limited
to the culturing, storing and delivery of stem cells through Stemcell. 

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, or the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. In the opinion of the management of the Company,
all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the three month period,
have been made. Results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected
for the entire fiscal year. When used in these notes, the terms  Company ,  we ,  us  or  our 
mean the Company. Certain information and note disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America has been omitted from these statements pursuant to such
accounting principles and, accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes necessary for comprehensive financial
statements and should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

NOTE
2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES      

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION  

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Stemcell Co., Ltd. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. 

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  

Accounts receivable are
recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful accounts
is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off as incurred. 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  

Property, plant and equipment ( PPE )
is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or
the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our PPE are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal
use, 2 to 3 years; computer equipment, 2 to 3 years; buildings and improvements, 5 to 15 years; leasehold improvements, 2 to 10
years; and furniture and equipment, 1 to 5 years. Land is not depreciated. 

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  

The reporting currency of the Company is the
United States Dollars ( US$ ) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$. The Company maintains
its books and record in its local currency, Japanese YEN ( JPY ), which is a functional currency as being the primary
currency of the economic environment in which its operation is conducted. In accordance with ASC Topic 830-30,  Translation
of Financial Statement , assets and liabilities of the Company whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$,
using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the
period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements are recorded as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income within the statements of shareholders  equity. 

Transactions denominated in currencies other
than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional
currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the
statements of operations.  

Translation of amounts from the local currency
of the Company into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates: 

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION  

A related party is generally defined as (i)
any person that holds 10% or more of the Company s securities and their immediate families, (ii) the Company s management,
(iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Company, or (iv) anyone
who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the Company. A transaction is considered to be a related
party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties. The Company conducts business with
its related parties in the ordinary course of business. 

Transactions involving related parties cannot
be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free market dealings may not
exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were
consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated. 

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR LOSS  

ASC Topic 220,  Comprehensive Income ,
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income or loss, its components and accumulated balances. Accumulated
comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying statements of shareholders  equity consists of changes in unrealized
gains and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive income or loss is not included in the computation of income
tax expense or benefit.

Table of Contents  

REVENUE
RECOGNITION      

The Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or
realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met:
(i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer,
(iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company provides the warranty
for the delivery of its service. If the Company cannot deliver its service to customers successfully, the Company retry its operation
until the delivery is completed. 

Income
taxes   

The Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future
tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company adopted section
740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Section 740-10-25 ). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination
of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under
Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not
that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that
has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance
on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased
disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions
of Section 740-10-25. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not
have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions. 

The Company conducts its major businesses in
Japan and is subject to tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities, the Company files tax returns that are
subject to examination by the local tax authority. 

Enterprise income tax in Japan is generally
charged at 29.97% of a company s assessable profit. The Company s subsidiaries incorporated in Japan are subject to
Japanese enterprises income tax at the applicable tax rates on the taxable income as reported in their Japanese statutory accounts
in accordance with the relevant enterprises income tax laws applicable to foreign enterprises. 

The Company is governed by the Income Tax Law
of Japan as well as Tokyo Local Income Tax Law ( the Income Tax Laws ). Under the Income Tax Laws, Corporations in
Tokyo, Japan are generally subject to an income tax at an effective rate of 29.97% on income as reported in their statutory financial
statements after appropriate tax adjustments unless the enterprise is located in specially designated regions of cities for which
more favorable effective tax rates apply. 

NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN   

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
are prepared on a basis of accounting assuming that the Company is a going concern that contemplates realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is considered a start-up company and has not yet generated
continuous revenue. Additionally, 69% of the revenues of the Company were from the related party for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will
offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue-producing
contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur,
it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions
or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders. 

NOTE 4 - RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

On January 27, 2016, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio,
the former sole shareholder of the Company, consummated a sale of 40,000,000,000 shares of our common stock to Dr. Takaaki Matsuoka.,
for an aggregate purchase price of $30,000. Following the closing of the share purchase transaction, Dr. Matsuoka gained a 100%
interest in the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. Commensurate with the closing, the Company, filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State, a Certificate of Amendment to change the name of Registrant to Stemcell Holdings, Inc. 

On January 27, 2016, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio resigned
as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. 

On January 27, 2016, Dr. Takaaki Matsuoka was
appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer.

    Business Information
of Stemcell    

The Company is a start-up stage company and concentrates on the
regenerative medicine-related business which includes but is not limited to the culturing, storing and delivery of stem cells through
Stemcell CO., LTD., a Japan Corporation ( Stemcell ), which is our wholly owned subsidiary.  

Our principal executive offices are located
at C/O Stemcell Co., Ltd., 5-9-15-3F, Minamiaoyama, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan. Our phone number is +81-3-3400-0077. 

 On March 4, 2016, Stemcell purchased the equipment unit for stem
cells culturing and storing from 4 constructors in aggregate consideration of 2,000,000 JPY ($19,737), which included the Liquid
Nitrogen Freezers, Centrifugal Separator, Biological Safety Cabinet and Carbon Oxide Incubator. As of September 30, 2016, the book
value of the equipment was $17,434. 

In August and September 2016, Stemcell purchased accessory equipment
in consideration of 37,837,000 JPY ($373,404), which included the clean room, air conditioning, electric work and interior. As

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

As of September 30, 2016, our cash balance was $1,459,930 and working

of $1,711,943. Our cash balance is currently sufficient to fund our operations. However, if our revenue cannot cover our operating
funds, we need to utilize funds from Takaaki Matsuoka, our sole Director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us
to pay for operating expenses. Takaaki Matsuoka, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance
or loan funds to the company. 

If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have
to suspend operations until we do raise the cash we need, or cease operations entirely. 

ITEM 3   
         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

As a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item
10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item.

ITEM 4   
         CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Management s Report on Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and
our chief financial officer (who is acting as our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principle accounting
officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of September 30, 2016, the end of the fiscal period covered by
this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our chief executive officer, with the participation of our
chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The officers
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report due
to material weaknesses identified below. 

Inherent limitations on effectiveness
of controls    

Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations
which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or
changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns
resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management
override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements
on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible
to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting that have occurred during our fiscal year end December 31, 2015 and for the interim period ending September 30, 2016,
that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
