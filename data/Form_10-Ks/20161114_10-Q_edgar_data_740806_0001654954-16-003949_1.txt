Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of F   M
Bank Corp. and its subsidiaries (the  Company ).
Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. 

The
consolidated financial statements conform to accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and to general
industry practices. In the opinion of management, the accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments
(consisting of only normal recurring accruals) necessary to present
fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. The notes included herein should be read in
conjunction with the notes to financial statements included in the
2015 annual report to shareholders of F   M Bank
Corp. 

Note 1
to the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC contains
a description of the accounting policies followed by the Company
and discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. The following
paragraphs update that information as necessary. 

In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
guidance to change the recognition of revenue from contracts with
customers. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity
should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of goods and
services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the
entity receives or expects to receive. The guidance will be
effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017. 

In
August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 
As a result of the deferral, the guidance in ASU 2014-09 will be
effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to
have a material effect on its financial statements 

In
January 2015, the FASB issued guidance to eliminate from U.S.
Generally Acceptable Accounting Principles (GAAP) the concept of an
extraordinary item, which is an event or transaction that is both
(1) unusual in nature and (2) infrequently occurring. Under the new
guidance, an entity will no longer (1) segregate an extraordinary
item from the results of ordinary operations; (2) separately
present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax,
after income from continuing operations; or (3) disclose income
taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary
item. The amendments were effective for the Company on January 1,
2016, and did not have a material effect on its financial
statements. 

In
February 2015, the FASB issued guidance which amends the
consolidation requirements and significantly changes the
consolidation analysis required under U.S. GAAP. The amendments
were expected to result in the deconsolidation of many entities.
The amendments were effective for the Company on January 1, 2016.
The adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on
the Company s financial statements.  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which provides a practical
expedient that permits the Company to measure defined benefit plan
assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the
Company s fiscal year-end. The amendments were effective for
the Company on January 1, 2016. The Company s adoption of
these amendments did not have a material effect on its financial
statements. 

In
August 2015, the FASB issued amendments to the Interest topic of
the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify the SEC
staff s position on presenting and measuring debt issuance
costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements. The
amendments were effective upon issuance. These amendments did not a
material effect on the Company s financial
statements 

In
January 2016, the FASB amended the Financial Instruments topic of
the Accounting Standards Codification to address certain aspects of
recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial
instruments. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The Company will apply the guidance   by means of a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal
year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities
without readily determinable fair values will be applied
prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of
adoption of the amendments. The Company does not expect these
amendments to have a material effect on its financial
statements.

Accounting
Principles, continued 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for
leases, which generally requires all leases to be recognized in the
statement of financial position. The provisions of this guidance
are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2018 including interim periods within those fiscal periods; early
adoption is permitted. These provisions are to be applied using a
modified retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating the
effect that this new guidance will have on our consolidated
financial statements. 

In
March 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with
Customers topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify
the implementation guidance on principal versus agent
considerations and address how an entity should assess whether it
is the principal or the agent in contracts that include three or
more parties.   The
amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect
these amendments to have a material effect on its financial
statements. 

In
April 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with
Customers topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify
the guidance related to identifying performance obligations and
accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The amendments
will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these
amendments to have a material effect on its financial
statements. 

In May
2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers
topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify guidance
related to collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of
sales tax, and transition. The amendments will be effective for the
Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material
effect on its financial statements. 

In June
2016, the FASB issued guidance to change the accounting for credit
losses and modify the impairment model for certain debt securities.
The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect that implementation of the new standard will
have on its financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows. 

I  n
August 2016, the FASB amended the Statement of Cash Flows topic of
the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify how certain cash
receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the
statement of cash flows. The amendments will be effective for the
Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017
including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its
financial statements.  

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB
or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have a
material impact on the Company s financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. 

Subsequent Events 

On
November 3, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a
stock repurchase program for up to 150,000 shares of its common
stock. There is no assurance that the Company will repurchase any
shares under this program, but repurchased shares will become
authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

Principles, continued 

Earnings per Share 

Accounting guidance
specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements
for earnings per share ( EPS ) for entities with
publicly held common stock or potential common stock such as
options, warrants, convertible securities or contingent stock
agreements if those securities trade in a public market. Basic EPS
is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding.  Diluted EPS is similar to
the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that
would have been outstanding if the dilutive common shares had been
issued.  The dilutive effect of conversion of preferred
stock is reflected in the diluted earnings per share
calculation. 

Net
income available to common stockholders represents consolidated net
income adjusted for preferred dividends declared. 

The
following table provides a reconciliation of net income to net
income available to common stockholders for the periods presented
(in thousands):

The
following tables represent the corporate credit exposure by
presenting the loan portfolio by the following credit quality
indicators (loan grades): 

Grade 1   Minimal Risk :
Excellent credit, superior asset quality, excellent debt capacity
and coverage, and recognized management capabilities. 

Grade 2   Modest Risk :
Borrower consistently generates sufficient cash flow to fund debt
service, excellent credit, above average asset quality and
liquidity. 

Grade 3   Average Risk :
Borrower generates sufficient cash flow to fund debt service.
Employment (or business) is stable with good future trends. Credit
is very good. 

Grade 4   Acceptable
Risk : Borrower s cash flow is adequate to cover debt
service; however, unusual expenses or capital expenses must by
covered through additional long term debt. Employment (or business)
stability is reasonable, but future trends may exhibit slight
weakness. Credit history is good. No unpaid judgments or collection
items appearing on credit report. 

Grade 5   Marginally
acceptable : Credit to borrowers who may exhibit declining
earnings, may have leverage that is materially above industry
averages, liquidity may be marginally acceptable. Employment or
business stability may be weak or deteriorating. May be currently
performing as agreed, but would be adversely affected by developing
factors such as layoffs, illness, reduced hours or declining
business prospects. Credit history shows weaknesses, past
due s , paid or disputed
collections and judgments, but does not include borrowers that are
currently past due on obligations or with unpaid, undisputed
judgments. 

Grade 6   Watch : Loans
are currently protected, but are weak due to negative balance sheet
or income statement trends. There may be a lack of effective
control over collateral or the existence of documentation
deficiencies. These loans have potential weaknesses that deserve
management s close attention. Other reasons supporting this
classification include adverse economic or market conditions,
pending litigation or any other material weakness. Existing loans
that become 60 or more days past due are placed in this category
pending a return to current status. 

Grade 7   Substandard :
Loans having well-defined weaknesses where a payment default and or
loss is possible, but not yet probable. Cash flow is inadequate to
service the debt under the current payment, or terms, with
prospects that the condition is permanent. Loans classified as
substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and
paying capacity of the borrower and there is the likelihood that
collateral will have to be liquidated and/or guarantor(s) called
upon to repay the debt. Generally, the loan is considered
collectible as to both principal and interest, primarily because of
collateral coverage, however, if the deficiencies are not corrected
quickly; there is a probability of loss.

Grade 8   Doubtful : The
loan has all the characteristics of a substandard credit, but
available information indicates it is unlikely the loan will be
repaid in its entirety. Cash flow is insufficient to service the
debt. It may be difficult to project the exact amount of loss, but
the probability of some loss is great. Loans are to be placed on
non-accrual status when any portion is classified
doubtful.

Fair
Value 

Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 820, defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level
valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and
enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The
valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the
valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The
three levels are defined as follows: 

Level 1    Inputs to the valuation
methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2    Inputs to the valuation
methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
substantially the full term of the financial
instrument. 

Level 3    Inputs to the valuation
methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value
measurement 

The
following sections provide a description of the valuation
methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well
as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the
valuation hierarchy: 

Securities: Where
quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are
classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1
securities would include highly liquid government bonds, mortgage
products and exchange traded equities. If quoted market prices are
not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing
models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics,
or discounted cash flow. Level 2 securities would include U.S.
agency securities, mortgage-backed agency securities, obligations
of states and political subdivisions and certain corporate, asset
backed and other securities. In certain cases where there is
limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the
valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the
valuation hierarchy. 

Loans
Held for Sale: Loans held for sale are short-term loans purchased
at par for resale to investors at the par value of the loan. 
These loans are generally repurchased within 15 days.  Because
of the short-term nature and fixed repurchased price, the book
value of these loans approximates fair value. 

Impaired Loans: ASC
820 applies to loans measured for impairment using the practical
expedients permitted by ASC 310 including impaired loans measured
at an observable market price (if available), or at the fair value
of the loan s collateral (if the loan is collateral
dependent). Fair value of the loan s collateral, when the
loan is dependent on collateral, is determined by appraisals or
independent valuation which is then adjusted for the cost related
to liquidation of the collateral. 

Other
Real Estate Owned: Certain assets such as other real estate owned
(OREO) are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value
less cost to sell. We believe that the fair value component in its
valuation follows the provisions of ASC 820. 

Derivative
Financial Instruments: The equity derivative contracts are
purchased as part of our Indexed Certificate of Deposit (ICD)
program and are an offset of an asset and liability. ICD values are
measured on the S P 500 Index.

7. Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments 

ASC 825
 Financial Instruments  defines the fair value of a
financial instrument as the amount at which a financial instrument
could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing
parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale. As the
majority of the Bank s financial instruments lack an
available trading market, significant estimates, assumptions and
present value calculations are required to determine estimated fair
value. The following presents the carrying amount, fair value and
placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company s
financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. 

The
carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, deposits with no
stated maturities, and accrued interest approximate fair value. The
fair value of securities was calculated using the most recent
transaction price or a pricing model, which takes into
consideration maturity, yields and quality. The remaining financial
instruments were valued based on the present value of estimated
future cash flows, discounted at various rates in effect for
similar instruments entered into as of the end of each respective
period shown above.

  Troubled
Debt Restructuring 

In the
determination of the allowance for loan losses, management
considers troubled debt restructurings and subsequent defaults in
these restructurings by adjusting the loan grades of such loans,
which figure into the environmental factors associated with the
allowance. Defaults resulting in charge-offs affect the historical
loss experience ratios which are a component of the allowance
calculation. Additionally, specific reserves may be established on
restructured loans evaluated individually. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were seven loan
modification that were considered to be troubled debt
restructurings, however one is now paid off and one is charged off.
Modifications may have included rate adjustments, revisions to
amortization schedules, suspension of principal payments for a
temporary period, re-advancing funds to be applied as payments to
bring the loan(s) current, or any combination thereof.

Forward-Looking
Statements 

Certain
statements in this report may constitute  forward-looking
statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are
statements that include projections, predictions, expectations or
beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not
statements of historical fact.  Such statements are often
characterized by the use of qualified words (and their derivatives)
such as  expect,   believe, 
 estimate,   plan,   project, 
or other statements concerning opinions or judgment of the Company
and its management about future events. 

Although the
Company believes that its expectations with respect to certain

within the bounds of its existing knowledge of its business and
operations, there can be no assurance that actual results,
performance or achievements of the Company will not differ
materially from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Actual
future results and trends may differ materially from historical
results or those anticipated depending on a variety of factors,
including, but not limited to, the effects of and changes in:
general economic conditions, the interest rate environment,
legislative and regulatory requirements, competitive pressures, new
products and delivery systems, inflation, changes in the stock and

Critical Accounting Policies 

General 

The
Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( GAAP ). The financial information
contained within the statements is, to a significant extent,
financial information that is based on measures of the financial
effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A
variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained
either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an
asset or relieving a liability. The Company uses historical loss
factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be
present in its loan portfolio. Actual losses could differ
significantly from the historical factors that are used. The fair
value of the investment portfolio is based on period end valuations
but changes daily with the market. In addition, GAAP itself may
change from one previously acceptable method to another method.
Although the economics of these transactions would be the same, the
timing of events that would impact these transactions could
change. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of
the losses that may be sustained in the loan portfolio. The
allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (i) ASC
450  Contingencies   ,   which requires that losses be accrued when they
are probable of occurring and estimable and (ii) ASC 310
 Receivables   ,   which requires that losses be accrued based on the
differences between the value of collateral, present value of
future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary
market and the loan balance. For further discussion refer to page
33 in the Management Discussion and Analysis.  

Goodwill and Intangibles 

ASC
805  Business Combinations  and ASC 350
 Intangibles  require that the purchase method of
accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001. Additionally, it further clarifies the criteria for
the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets
separate from goodwill. ASC 350 prescribes the accounting for
goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition.
The provisions of ASC 350 discontinue the amortization of goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Instead, these assets
will be subject to at least an annual impairment review and more
frequently if certain impairment indicators are in evidence. ASC
350 also requires that reporting units be identified for the
purpose of assessing potential future impairments of
goodwill. 

Securities Impairment

a complete discussion of securities impairment see Note 2 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Overview 

Net
income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $7,050,000
or $2.03 per share, compared to $6,237,000 or $1.78 in the same
period in 2015, an increase of 13.04%. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, noninterest income increased 13.42% and
noninterest expense increased 8.18% during the same period. Net
income from Bank operations adjusted for income from Parent
activities is as follows: 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, net income was
$2,602,000 or $.75 per share, compared to $2,190,000 or $.63 in the
same period in 2015, an increase of 18.81%. In the three months
ended September 30, 3016, noninterest income increased 25.93% and
noninterest expense increased 10.41% compared to the same period in
2015.

Results of Operations 

As
shown in Table I on page 39, the 2016 year to date tax equivalent
net interest income increased $1,421,000 or 7.18% compared to the
same period in 2015. The tax equivalent adjustment to net interest
income totaled $98,000 for the nine months. The yield on earning
assets decreased .05%, while the cost of funds increased .10%
compared to the same period in 2015. The three months ended
September 30, 2016 tax equivalent net interest income increased
$532,000 or 7.91% compared to the same period in 2015. The tax
equivalent adjustment to net interest income totaled $33,000 for
the three months. 

The
combination of the decrease in yield on assets and the increase in
cost of funds for the three and nine month periods coupled with
changes in balance sheet leverage has resulted in the net interest
margin decreasing to 4.33%, a decrease of 12 basis points year to
date when compared to the same period in 2015. The quarter to date
net interest margin of 4.23% is an 18 basis points decrease from
the same period in 2015. The loans held for sale portfolio has had
substantial growth in the average balances and while the portfolio
is highly profitable, the yield is lower. A schedule of the net
interest margin for the three and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 can be found in Table I on page
39. 

The
Interest Sensitivity Analysis contained in Table II on page 40
indicates the Company is in an asset sensitive position in the one
year time horizon. As the notes to the table indicate, the data was
based in part on assumptions as to when certain assets or
liabilities would mature or reprice. Approximately 47.21% of rate
sensitive assets and 33.13% of rate sensitive liabilities are
subject to repricing within one year. Due to the relatively flat
yield curve, management has kept deposit rates low. The growth in
earning assets and the growth in noninterest bearing accounts has
resulted in the decrease in the positive GAP position in the one
year time period. 

The
increase in noninterest income of $324,000 for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016 and $217,000 for the three-month
period ended 2016 is primarily due to an increase in income from
VBS Mortgage, service charge income and debit card fees over the
same period in 2015. 

Noninterest expense
increased $1,094,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30,
2016 as compared to 2015. Expense increased in the areas of
salaries and benefits (additions to staff at new branches), legal
and professional fees, and demand account program fees. The
noninterest expense for the three ended September 30, 2016
increased $468,000 over the same period in 2015. As stated in the
most recently available (September 30, 2016) Uniform Bank
Performance Report, the Company s and peer s
noninterest expenses averaged 2.76% and 2.84% of average assets,
respectively. The Company s operating costs have always
compared favorably to the peer group due to an excellent asset to
employee ratio and below average facilities costs.

Balance Sheet 

Federal
Funds Sold and Interest Bearing Bank Deposits 

The
Company s subsidiary bank invests a portion of its excess
liquidity in either federal funds sold or interest bearing bank
deposits. Federal funds sold offer daily liquidity and pay market
rates of interest that at quarter end were benchmarked at .25% to
..50% by the Federal Reserve. Actual rates received vary slightly
based upon money supply and demand among banks. Interest bearing
bank deposits are held either in money market accounts or as
short-term certificates of deposits. Combined balances in fed funds
sold and interest bearing bank deposits have increased since year
end due to the growth in Loans Held for Sale. At September 30,
2016, the Company held $286,000 in interest bearing bank deposits
and $4,151,000 in federal funds sold as compared to $1,596,000 in
interest bearing bank deposits and $0 in federal funds sold at
December 31, 2015. 

Securities 

The
Company s securities portfolio serves several purposes.
Portions of the portfolio are held to assist the Company with asset
liability management and as security for certain public funds and
repurchase agreements. 

The
securities portfolio consists of investment securities commonly
referred to as securities held to maturity and securities available
for sale. Securities are classified as Held to Maturity investment
securities when management has the intent and ability to hold the
securities to maturity. Held to Maturity Investment securities are
carried at amortized cost. Securities available for sale include
securities that may be sold in response to general market
fluctuations, liquidity needs and other similar factors. Securities
available for sale are recorded at market value. Unrealized holding
gains and losses on available for sale securities are excluded from
earnings and reported (net of deferred income taxes) as a separate
component of stockholders  equity. 

At
September 30, 2016, the Company s investment portfolio
totaled $38.6 million as compared to $25.3 million at December 31,
2015. As of September 30, 2016, the market value of securities
available for sale exceeded their cost by $37,000. The portfolio is
made up of primarily agency securities with an average portfolio
life of just over two years. This short average life results in
less portfolio volatility and positions the Bank to redeploy assets
in response to rising rates. Other investments consist of stock of
correspondent banks and investments in low income housing projects.
There are $20 million in securities that mature in
2016. 

In
reviewing investments as of September 30, 2016, there were no
securities which met the definition for other than temporary
impairment. Management continues to re-evaluate the portfolio for
impairment on a quarterly basis. 

Loan
Portfolio 

The
Company operates in a predominately rural area that includes the
counties of Rockingham, Page, Shenandoah and Augusta in the western
portion of Virginia. The local economy benefits from a variety of
businesses including agri-business, manufacturing, service
businesses and several universities and colleges. The Bank is an
active residential mortgage and residential construction lender and
generally makes commercial loans to small and mid-size businesses
and farms within its primary service area. 

Lending
is geographically diversified within the service area. The Company
has loan concentrations within the portfolio in construction and
development lending as well as hotel/motel lending. Management and
the Board of Directors review this concentration and other
potential areas of concentration quarterly.

Loans
Held for Sale totaled $83,164,000 at September 30, 2016, an
increase of $25,358,000 compared to December 31, 2015. Secondary
market loan originations have been very strong for both VBS
Mortgage and Northpointe Bank during the first nine months of
2016. 

Nonperforming loans
include nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due.
Nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest accruals have been
suspended or discontinued permanently. Nonperforming loans totaled
$6,196,000 at September 30, 2016 compared to $6,526,000 at December
31, 2015. Although the potential exists for loan losses, management
believes the bank is generally well secured and continues to
actively work with its customers to effect payment. As of September
30, 2016, the Company holds $2,076,000 of real estate which was
acquired through foreclosure. This is a decrease of $52,000
compared to December 31, 2015.

Allowance
for Loan Losses 

The
allowance for loan losses provides for the risk that borrowers will
be unable to repay their obligations. The risk associated with real
estate and installment notes to individuals is based upon
employment, the local and national economies and consumer
confidence. All of these affect the ability of borrowers to repay
indebtedness. The risk associated with commercial lending is
substantially based on the strength of the local and national
economies. 

Management
evaluates the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis in
light of national and local economic trends, changes in the nature
and volume of the loan portfolio and trends in past due and
criticized loans. Specific factors evaluated include internally
generated loan review reports, past due reports, historical loan
loss experience and changes in the financial strength of individual
borrowers that have been included on the Bank s watch list or
schedule of classified loans. 

In
evaluating the portfolio, loans are segregated into loans with
identified potential losses, unimpaired/nonclassified loans and
classified loans. Loans with identified potential losses include
examiner and bank classified loans. Relationships rated substandard
and in excess of $500,000 and loans identified as Troubled Debt
Restructurings are reviewed individually for impairment under ASC
310. A variety of factors are taken into account when reviewing
these credits including borrower cash flow, payment history, fair
value of collateral, company management, the industry in which the
borrower is involved and economic factors. 

Classified loans
are segmented by call report code, past due status and risk rating.
Loss rates are assigned based on actual loss experience over the
last five years, calculated quarterly and multiplied by a risk
factor. Each classified loan segment is given an appropriate
factor. 

Loans
that are unimpaired/nonclassified are categorized by call report
code and an estimate is calculated based on actual loss experience
over the last five years. Dealer finance loans utilize a loss rate
based on the highest loss in the last five years due the growth in
the portfolio and the age of the division. Six environmental
factors are used to reflect other changes in the collectability of
the portfolio not captured by the historical loss date (loan
growth, unemployment, interest rates, changes in underwriting
practices, local real estate industry conditions, and experience of
lending staff). The Board approves the loan loss provision for each
quarter based on this evaluation. 

The
allowance for loan losses of $7,571,000 at September 30, 2016 is
equal to 1.31% of loans held for investment. This compares to an
allowance of $8,781,000 (1.61%) at December 31, 2015. Based on the
evaluation of the loan portfolio described above, management has
not funded the allowance in the first nine months of 2016. Net
charge-offs year to date totaled $1,210,000. 

The
overall level of the allowance is slightly higher than the national
peer group average. Based on historical losses, delinquency rates,
collateral values of delinquent loans and a thorough review of the
loan portfolio, management is of the opinion that the allowance for
loan losses fairly states the estimated losses in the current
portfolio.

Deposits
and Other Borrowings 

The Company's main source of funding
is comprised of deposits received from individuals, governmental
entities and businesses located within the Company's service area.
Deposit accounts include demand deposits, savings, money market and
certificates of deposit. Total deposits have increased $33,154,000
since December 31, 2015. Time deposits decreased $2,924,000 during
this period while demand deposits and savings deposits increased
$36,078,000. The increase in deposits can be attributed to all
branches and areas in our footprint ; programs and products
have been put into place in the last several years to grow
deposits. The Bank also participates in the CDARS program. CDARS
(Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service) is a program that
allows the bank to accept customer deposits in excess of FDIC
limits and through reciprocal agreements with other network
participating banks by offering FDIC insurance up to as much as $50
million in deposits. The CDARS program also allows the Bank to
purchase funds through its One-Way Buy program. At quarter end the
Bank had a total of $1.8 million in CDARS funding, which is a
decrease of $3.87 million from December 31, 2015. 

Short-term
borrowings 

Short-term debt
consists of federal funds purchased, daily rate credit obtained
from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), short-term fixed rate FHLB
borrowings and commercial repurchase agreements (repos). Commercial
customers deposit operating funds into their checking account and
by mutual agreement with the bank their excess funds are swept
daily into the repurchase accounts. These accounts are not
considered deposits and are not insured by the FDIC. The Bank
pledges securities held in its investment portfolio as collateral
for these short-term loans. Federal funds purchased are overnight
borrowings obtained from the Bank s primary correspondent
bank to manage short-term liquidity needs. Borrowings from the FHLB
have been used to finance loans held for sale and also to finance
the increase in short-term residential and commercial construction
loans. As of September 30, 2016, there were $50,000,000 in FHLB
short-term borrowings and commercial repurchase agreements totaled
$1,229,000. This compared to FHLB short-term borrowings of
$20,000,000, federal funds purchased of $959,000 and commercial
repurchase agreements of $3,995,000 at December 31,
2015. 

Long-term
borrowings 

Borrowings from the
FHLB continue to be an important source of funding. The
Company s subsidiary bank borrows funds on a fixed rate
basis. These borrowings are used to fund loan growth and also
assist the Bank in matching the maturity of its fixed rate real
estate loan portfolio with the maturity of its debt and thus reduce
its exposure to interest rate changes. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 there were $3,072,000 in scheduled repayments
and $20,000,000 in additional borrowings. There were $1,107,000 of
scheduled repayments and no additional borrowings during the
quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

Capital 

The
Company seeks to maintain a strong capital base to expand
facilities, promote public confidence, support current operations
and grow at a manageable level. 

At
September 30, 2016, Company s total risk based capital and
leverage ratios were 14.70% and 11.61%, respectively, as compared
to December 31, 2015 of 15.38% and 12.18%, respectively. For the
same period, Bank-only total risk based capital and leverage ratios
were 14.37% and 11.32%, respectively, as compared to December 31,
2015 of 15.24% and 12.06%, respectively. Both the Company and the
Bank are reporting common equity tier 1 capital ratios of 11.98%
and 13.16%, respectively as compared to December 31, 2015 of 12.46%
and 13.99%. The Bank also reported a Capital conservation buffer of
6.37% as of September 30, 2016. For both the Company and the Bank
these ratios are in excess of regulatory minimums to be considered
 well capitalized .

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (Continued) 

Contractual
Obligations 

The
Company s significant fixed and determinable contractual
obligations include time deposits and short term debt, the payment
dates of which are presented in Table II on page 40. The payment
amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the
recipient. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is the
ability to meet present and future financial obligations through
either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition
of additional funds through liability management. Liquid assets
include cash, interest-bearing deposits with banks, federal funds
sold, investments and loans maturing within one year. The Company's
ability to obtain deposits and purchase funds at favorable rates
determines its liquidity exposure. As a result of the Company's
management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity
through liability funding, management believes that the Company
maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors'
requirements and meet its customers' credit needs. 

Additional sources
of liquidity available to the Company include, but are not limited
to, loan repayments, the ability to obtain deposits through the
adjustment of interest rates and the purchasing of federal funds.
To further meet its liquidity needs, the Company s subsidiary
bank maintains lines of credit with its primary correspondent
financial institution, Community Bankers Bank, and Zions Bank. The
Bank also has a line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Atlanta (FHLB) that allows for secured borrowings. 

The
following table presents the available and outstanding balances of
the Company s lines of credit 

The
following table presents the borrowing capacity with the FHLB from
pledged loans as of September 30, 2016: 

The
outstanding borrowings includes $50 million in short term
borrowings that directly support the loans held for
sale. 

Interest
Rate Sensitivity 

In
conjunction with maintaining a satisfactory level of liquidity,
management must also control the degree of interest rate risk
assumed on the balance sheet. Managing this risk involves regular
monitoring of interest sensitive assets relative to interest
sensitive liabilities over specific time intervals. The Company
monitors its interest rate sensitivity periodically and makes
adjustments as needed. There are no off balance sheet items that
will impair future liquidity. 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had a cumulative Gap Rate
Sensitivity Ratio of 23.31% for the one year repricing period. This
generally indicates that earnings would increase in an increasing
interest rate environment as assets reprice more quickly than
liabilities. However, in actual practice, this may not be the case
as balance sheet leverage, funding needs and competitive factors
within the market could dictate the need to raise deposit rates
more quickly. Management constantly monitors the Company s
interest rate risk and has decided the current position is
acceptable for a well-capitalized community bank. 

A
summary of asset and liability repricing opportunities is shown in
Table II, on page 40.

  Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Off-Balance
Sheet Risk 

The
Company makes commitments to extend credit in the normal course of
business and issues standby letters of credit to meet the financing
needs of its customers. The amount of the commitments represents
the Company's exposure to credit loss that is not included in the
balance sheet. As of the balance sheet dates, the Company had the
following commitments outstanding: 

The
Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments to lend
money and issue standby letters of credit as it does for the loans
reflected in the balance sheet. 

Commitments to
extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there
is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of
the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon,
the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future
cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's
creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. Collateral required, if
any, upon extension of credit is based on management's credit
evaluation of the borrower s ability to pay. Collateral held
varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property,
plant and equipment. 

Effect
of Newly Issued Accounting Standards 

In May
2014, the FASB issued guidance to change the recognition of revenue
from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new
guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the
transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount equal to
the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive. The
guidance will be effective for the Company for reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017. 

In
August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers.  As a result of the deferral, the guidance in ASU
2014-09 will be effective for the Company for reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect
these amendments to have a material effect on its financial
statements 

In
January 2015, the FASB issued guidance to eliminate from U.S. GAAP
the concept of an extraordinary item, which is an event or
transaction that is both (1) unusual in nature and (2) infrequently
occurring. Under the new guidance, an entity will no longer (1)
segregate an extraordinary item from the results of ordinary
operations; (2) separately present an extraordinary item on its
income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing
operations; or (3) disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share
data applicable to an extraordinary item. The amendments were
effective for the Company on January 1, 2016, and did not have a
material effect on its financial statements. 

In
February 2015, the FASB issued guidance which amends the
consolidation requirements and significantly changes the
consolidation analysis required under U.S. GAAP. The amendments
were expected to result in the deconsolidation of many entities.
The amendments were effective for the Company on January 1, 2016.
The adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on
the Company s financial statements.  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which provides a practical
expedient that permits the Company to measure defined benefit plan
assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the
Company s fiscal year-end. The amendments were effective for
the Company on January 1, 2016. The Company s adoption of
these amendments did not have a material effect on its financial
statements.

Effect
of Newly Issued Accounting Standards, continued 

In
August 2015, the FASB issued amendments to the Interest topic of
the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify the SEC
staff s position on presenting and measuring debt issuance
costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements. The
amendments were effective upon issuance. The Company does not
expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial
statements 

In
January 2016, the FASB amended the Financial Instruments topic of
the Accounting Standards Codification to address certain aspects of
recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial
instruments. The amendments will be effective for [fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The Company will apply the guidance   by means of a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal
year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities
without readily determinable fair values will be applied
prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of
adoption of the amendments. The Company does not expect these
amendments to have a material effect on its financial
statements. 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for
leases, which generally requires all leases to be recognized in the
statement of financial position. The provisions of this guidance
are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2018; early adoption is permitted. These provisions are to be
applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is
evaluating the effect that this new guidance will have on our
consolidated financial statements, but does not expect it will have
a material effect on its financial statements. 

In
March 2016, the FASB amended the Liabilities topic of the
Accounting Standards Codification to address the current and
potential future diversity in practice related to the derecognition
of a prepaid stored-value product liability. The amendments will be
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The Company will apply the guidance using a
modified retrospective transition method by means of a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective to
each period presented. The Company does not expect these amendments
to have a material effect on its financial
statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with
Customers topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify
the implementation guidance on principal versus agent
considerations and address how an entity should assess whether it
is the principal or the agent in contracts that include three or
more parties.   The
amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect
these amendments to have a material effect on its financial
statements. 

In
April 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with
Customers topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify
the guidance related to identifying performance obligations and
accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The amendments
will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these
amendments to have a material effect on its financial
statements. 

In May
2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers
topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify guidance
related to collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of
sales tax, and transition. The amendments will be effective for the
Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material
effect on its financial statements.

Effect
of Newly Issued Accounting Standards, continued 

In June
2016, the FASB issued guidance to change the accounting for credit
losses and modify the impairment model for certain debt securities.
The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect that implementation of the new standard will
have on its financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows. 

I  n
August 2016, the FASB amended the Statement of Cash Flows topic of
the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify how certain cash
receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the
statement of cash flows. The amendments will be effective for the
Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017
including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its
financial statements.  

Other
accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB or other

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As a
result of the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, issuers
such as F   M Bank Corp. that file periodic reports under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Act") are required to include
in those reports certain information concerning the issuer's
controls and procedures for complying with the disclosure
requirements of the federal securities laws. These disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by an issuer in the reports it files or submits under the
Act, is recorded , processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms and is accumulated and
communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal
executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

As
required, we will evaluate the effectiveness of these disclosure
controls and procedures on a quarterly basis, and most recently did
so as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

The
Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period
covered by this quarterly report of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) of the
Act), have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures are effective for purposes of Rule
13(a)-15(b).
