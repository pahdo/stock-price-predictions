    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
 (Unaudited)    (Dollars in thousands,
except where noted and per share data)     Note 1   Basis of Presentation and Description of Business   
 As used herein, unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms  we ,  us ,  our  or  Company  collectively refer to
John B. Sanfilippo   Son, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, JBSS Ventures, LLC and Sanfilippo (Shanghai) Trading Co. Ltd. Our fiscal year ends on the final Thursday of June each year, and typically consists of fifty-two weeks (four
thirteen-week quarters). Fiscal 2016 consisted of fifty-three weeks, with our fourth quarter containing fourteen weeks. Additional information on the comparability of the periods presented is as follows:  

We are one of the leading processors and distributors of peanuts, pecans, cashews, walnuts, almonds, and other nuts in the United States. These nuts are sold
under a variety of private brands and under the  Fisher, Orchard Valley Harvest, Fisher Nut Exactly,  and  Sunshine Country  brand names. We also market and distribute, and in most cases manufacture or process, a diverse product line of
food and snack products, including peanut butter, almond butter, candy and confections, snacks and trail mixes, snack bites, sunflower kernels, dried fruit, corn snacks, sesame sticks and other sesame snack products under private brands and brand
names. Our products are sold through three primary distribution channels to significant buyers of nuts, including food retailers in the consumer channel, commercial ingredient users and contract packaging customers.  
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements fairly present the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated statements of cash flows, and reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments which are necessary for the fair statement of the results of the interim periods. Preparing financial statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.    The interim results of operations are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year. The balance sheet data as of June 30, 2016 was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Accordingly, these unaudited financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2016
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.     Note 2   Inventories   
 Inventories consist of the following:

   Note 3   Credit Facility   
 On July 7, 2016, we entered into the Seventh Amendment to Credit Agreement (the  Seventh Amendment ) which extended the maturity date of the
Credit Agreement from July 15, 2019 to July 7, 2021, and reduced by twenty-five basis points the interest rates charged for loan advances and letter of credit borrowings. The unused line fee was reduced to 0.25% per annum. The
aggregate revolving loan commitment remained unchanged. In addition, the Seventh Amendment allows the Company to, without obtaining Bank Lender consent, (i) make up to one cash dividend or distribution on our stock per quarter, or
(ii) purchase, acquire, redeem or retire stock in any fiscal quarter, in any case, in an amount not to exceed $60,000 in the aggregate per fiscal year, as long as no default or event of default exists and the excess availability under the
Credit Agreement remains over $30,000 immediately before and after giving effect to any such dividend, distribution, purchase or redemption. The Seventh Amendment also permits an additional 5% of outstanding accounts receivable from a major customer
to be included as eligible in the borrowing base calculation and reduced the amount available for letter of credit usage to $10,000.    At September 29,
2016, we had $112,570 of available credit under the Credit Facility which reflects borrowings of $1,255 and reduced availability as a result of $3,675 in outstanding letters of credit. As of September 29, 2016, we were in compliance with all
covenants under the Credit Facility and Mortgage Facility.     Note 4   Earnings Per Common Share   
 The following table presents the reconciliation of the weighted average shares outstanding used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share:  
   
   There were no anti-dilutive awards excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for either period presented.
    Note 5   Stock-Based Compensation Plans     During
the quarter ended September 29, 2016 there was no significant stock option or restricted stock unit activity.    Compensation expense attributable to
stock-based compensation during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was $550 and $466, respectively. As of September 29, 2016, there was $2,221 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested, share-based compensation
arrangements granted under our stock-based compensation plans. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of 0.9 years. See  Note 11- Recent Accounting Pronouncements  below for a description of new accounting
guidance on share based payments adopted this quarter.    Note 6   Special Cash Dividend   
 On July 7, 2016, our Board of Directors, after considering the financial position of our Company and other factors, declared a special cash dividend of
$2.50 per share on all issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock of the Company (the  2016 Special Dividend ). The 2016 Special Dividend of approximately $28,150 was paid on August 4, 2016 to
stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 21, 2016.

   Note 7  Retirement Plan   
 The Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan that will provide eligible participants with monthly
benefits upon retirement, disability or death, subject to certain conditions. The monthly benefit is based upon each participant s earnings and his or her number of years of service. Administrative expenses include the following net periodic
benefit costs:      
    Note 8   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss   
 The table below sets forth the changes to accumulated other comprehensive loss ( AOCL ) for the quarter ended September 29, 2016 and September 24,

   Note 9   Commitments and Contingent Liabilities   
 We are currently a party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While management presently believes that the ultimate outcomes of
these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially affect our Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable outcomes could
occur. Unfavorable outcomes could include substantial monetary damages in excess of any appropriate accruals which management has established. Were such unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.     Note 10   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 Authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) defines fair value as the price that would be received for an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into
three broad levels:      

Level 1 

Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities.  

Level 2 

Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.  

Level 3 

Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available.  
   The carrying values of cash, trade accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values at each balance
sheet date because of the short-term maturities and nature of these balances.    The carrying value of our revolving credit facility borrowings approximates
fair value at each balance sheet date because interest rates on this instrument approximate current market rates (Level 2 criteria), the short-term maturity and nature of this balance. In addition, there has been no significant change in our
inherent credit risk.    The following table summarizes the carrying value and fair value estimate of our current and long term debt, excluding unamortized
debt issuance costs:      
   The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was determined using a market approach based upon Level 2 observable inputs,
which estimates fair value based on interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality or broker quotes. In addition, there have been no significant changes in the underlying assets securing our
long-term debt.

   Note 11   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) .  This ASU is part of the FASB s
simplification initiative. The areas for simplification in this update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities, statutory withholding requirements, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company early adopted this guidance during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We now recognize forfeitures as they occur and excess tax
benefits or deficiencies as a component of income tax expense. The cumulative adjustment for the impact of this change in accounting principle was immaterial. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits will prospectively be classified as
operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Prior periods have not been adjusted. The Company anticipates increased volatility in income tax expense, mainly in the second quarter of each fiscal year, since
historically most equity compensation granted in prior periods vests during that quarter.    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05
  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other   Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  . This update provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud
computing arrangement includes a software license or service contract. This update became effective for the Company beginning the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The adoption of ASU 2015-05 did not have a material impact to the consolidated
financial statements.    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs .  This update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent
with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 was effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption of this standard required restatement of our consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2016 and September 24,
2015. As a result, Other assets decreased approximately $244 and $299 as of June 30, 2016 and September 24, 2015, respectively,    and these amounts were allocated within Current maturities of long term debt and Long term
debt. Adoption of this standard did not have an effect on the Company s results of operations or cash flows.    In February 2015, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-02   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . This update focuses on a reporting company s consolidation evaluation to determine whether it should consolidate certain legal
entities. The guidance ASU 2015-02 became effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have any impact to the consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17   Consolidation (Topic 810):     Interests Held Through Related Parties That Are Under Common Control  . This update is amending ASU 2015-02 and affects reporting entities that are
required to evaluate whether they should consolidate a variable interest entity in certain situations involving entities under common control. ASU 2016-17 will be effective for the Company in fiscal 2018 and will require retrospective
application. The Company does not expect ASU 2016-17 to have any impact to the consolidated financial statements.   In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-15     Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments    . This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the perceived
diversity in practice. The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including
adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption
must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The amendments in this update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company does not expect a material impact to our statement of cash
flows once this update is adopted.         In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02   Leases (Topic
842) .  The primary goal of this update is to require the lessee to recognize all lease commitments, both operating and finance, by initially recording a lease asset and liability on the balance sheet at the lease commencement date.
Additionally, enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures will be required. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for public business entities for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
December 15, 2018. This new guidance will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2020. This guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing
the impact of this new guidance on its financial position, results of operations and disclosures and does not expect to early adopt.

  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606)   and created a new ASC Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and added ASC Subtopic 340-40,  Other Assets and Deferred Costs   Contracts with Customers . The guidance in this update supersedes the revenue
recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , and most industry-specific guidance throughout the industry topics of the codification. Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of
promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Several other amendments have been subsequently released, each of which provide
additional narrow scope clarifications or improvements. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14   Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective Date   which deferred the effective date of ASU
2014-09 for one year. Consequently, this new revenue recognition guidance will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2019, which is our anticipated adoption date. We are currently evaluating the method of adoption. 
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Topic 205-40)  . The guidance
requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or
events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 was effective for the Company beginning with the quarter ended September 29, 2016. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our
consolidated financial statements.     Note 12   Subsequent Event   
 On November 1, 2016, our Board of Directors, after considering the financial position of our Company, declared a special cash dividend of $2.50 per share on
all issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock of the Company (the  2017 Special Dividend ). The 2017 Special Dividend will be paid on December 13, 2016, to stockholders of record at the close of business
on November 30, 2016. The ex-dividend date is the close of business on November 28, 2016. The total amount of cash expected to be paid to stockholders under the 2017 Special Dividend will be approximately $28,312.

     Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations      OVERVIEW     The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 Our fiscal year ends on the final Thursday of June each year, and typically consists of fifty-two weeks (four thirteen week quarters). Fiscal 2016 consisted
of fifty-three weeks, with our fourth quarter containing fourteen weeks. Additional information on the comparability of the periods presented is as follows:      

As used herein, unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms  we ,  us ,  our  or  Company  collectively refer to
John B. Sanfilippo   Son, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, JBSS Ventures, LLC and Sanfilippo (Shanghai) Trading Co. Ltd. Our Company s Credit Facility and Mortgage Facility, as defined below, are sometimes collectively referred to as
 our financing arrangements.     We are one of the leading processors and distributors of peanuts, pecans, cashews, walnuts, almonds and other
nuts in the United States. These nuts are sold under a variety of private brands and under the  Fisher, Orchard Valley Harvest, Fisher Nut Exactly,  and  Sunshine Country  brand names. We also market and distribute, and in most cases
manufacture or process, a diverse product line of food and snack products, including peanut butter, almond butter, candy and confections, snacks and trail mixes, snack bites, sunflower kernels, dried fruit, corn snacks, sesame sticks and other
sesame snack products under private brands and brand names. We distribute our products in the consumer, commercial ingredients and contract packaging distribution channels.  
 The Company s long-term objective to drive profitable growth, as identified in our strategic plan (the  Strategic Plan ), includes
growing  Fisher  and  Orchard Valley Harvest  into leading nut brands by focusing on consumers demanding quality nuts in the snacking, recipe and produce categories and providing integrated nut solutions to grow
non-branded business at existing key customers in each distribution channel.        We face a number of challenges in the future which
include, among others, volatile commodity costs for certain tree nuts and intensified competition for market share from both private brand and name brand nut products. Acquisition costs for almonds and walnuts declined significantly during the
second half of fiscal 2016. These declines in acquisition costs have resulted in lower selling prices for products that contain these nuts. Since sales of almonds and walnuts comprise a significant percentage of our total net sales, we
anticipate that lower selling prices will continue to result in a reduction in net sales in future comparisons until the impact of lower retail prices ultimately drives increased sales volume for these products. 
 We will continue to focus on seeking profitable business opportunities to further utilize our additional production capacity at our primary manufacturing,
processing and distribution facility located in Elgin, Illinois (the  Elgin Site ). We expect to maintain our recent level of promotional, sampling and advertising activity for our  Fisher  and  Orchard Valley Harvest  brands,
and our new  Fisher Nut Exactly  brand snack bite product line. We will continue to face the ongoing challenges specific to our business, such as food safety and regulatory issues and the maintenance and growth of our customer base. See the
information referenced in Part II, Item 1A    Risk Factors  of this report for additional information about our risks, challenges and uncertainties.

   QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS   
 Our net sales of $222.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 1.5% from our net sales of $225.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.
   Sales volume, measured as pounds sold to customers, increased 5.9 million pounds, or 9.7%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  
 Gross profit increased by $3.3 million and our gross profit margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 16.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017
compared to 14.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.    Total operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased by $0.5 million, or 2.4%,
compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. As a percentage of net sales, total operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased to 9.0% from 8.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  
 The total value of inventories on hand at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased by $40.7 million, or 21.7%, in comparison to the total value
of inventories on hand at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2016.    With the exception of pecans and almonds, we have seen acquisition costs for
domestic tree nuts decrease in the 2016 crop year (which falls into our current 2017 fiscal year). While we began to procure inshell walnuts during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the total payments due to our walnut growers will not be determined
until the second and/or third quarters of fiscal 2017. We will determine the final prices to be paid to the walnut growers based upon current market prices and other factors such as crop size and export demand. We have estimated the liability to our
walnut growers and our walnut inventory costs using currently available information. Any difference between our estimated liability and the actual payments will be determined during the second and/or third quarters of fiscal 2017 and will be
recognized in our financial results at that time.

   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
   Net Sales      Our net sales decreased 1.5% to $222.3
million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to net sales of $225.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to a 10.3% decrease in the weighted average sales price per pound driven by
lower commodity acquisition costs for walnuts and almonds. Sales volume, which is defined as pounds sold to customers, increased approximately 9.7%. The sales volume increase was driven mainly by increases in sales of peanuts, walnuts,
pecans and almonds, and sales volume increased in all distribution channels.   The following table summarizes sales by product type as a percentage of total
gross sales. The information is based upon gross sales, rather than net sales, because certain adjustments, such as promotional discounts, are not allocable to product type.      
   The following table shows a comparison of net sales by distribution channel (dollars in thousands):  

(1) 
 Sales of branded products, primarily all  Fisher  brand, were approximately 39% and 32% of total consumer sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.    
 Net sales in the consumer distribution channel increased by 2.2% in dollars and 14.2% in sales volume in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the
first quarter of fiscal 2016. The sales volume increase was driven primarily by increased sales of our branded products. Sales volume for  Fisher  recipe nuts increased 44.6% due to distribution gains with new customers, the
introduction of larger package sizes for walnuts, and increased promotional activity. Sales volume for  Fisher  snack nuts and peanut butter increased a combined 13.2%, primarily as a result of distribution gains with new customers and
increased product display activity. A 192.5% increase in combined sales volume of  Orchard Valley Harvest  and  Sunshine Country  produce products, due to increased promotional activity and new item introductions, also contributed to
the sales volume increase. Partially offsetting the sales volume increases noted above was a significant sales volume decline for  Fisher Nut Exactly  snack bites ,  which was largely due to lost distribution to club stores. The
sales volume increase in the consumer distribution channel was also due in part to an 8.2% increase in sales volume with existing private brand customers.

  Net sales in the commercial ingredients distribution channel decreased by 16.8% in dollars and sales volume
increased 1.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The sales volume increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of peanuts to peanut oil stock crushers. The decrease in net sales was largely
due to lower selling prices on products containing almonds. In the second quarter we expect net sales to continue to decline in the commercial ingredients channel due to an existing customer changing vendors to a vertically-integrated almond
butter supplier.   Net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel increased by 11.8% in dollars and 6.7% in sales volume in the first quarter of
fiscal 2017 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The sales volume increase was primarily due to increased sales of trail mixes, almonds and cashews to existing customers.  
   Gross Profit      Gross profit increased by $3.3
million, or 9.8%, to $36.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Our gross profit margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 16.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to
14.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to increased sales volume as discussed above. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily a result of lower acquisition costs for walnuts and
almonds combined with improved alignment of selling prices and acquisition costs for pecans.      Operating Expenses    
 Total operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased by $0.5 million to $19.9 million. Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal
2017 increased to 9.0% of net sales from 8.6% of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 largely as a result of a lower sales base.    Selling
expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were $11.3 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1.0%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease was driven primarily by $0.5 million less advertising expenses and $0.4 million less
compensation related expenses, which were almost fully offset by a $0.8 million increase in shipping costs driven by increased sales volume.  
 Administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were $8.6 million, an increase of $0.6 million, or 7.1%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2016.
The increase was driven primarily by increased compensation related expenses.      Income from Operations    
 Due to the factors discussed above, income from operations increased to $16.6 million, or 7.4% of net sales, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $13.7
million, or 6.1% of net sales, for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.      Interest Expense    
 Interest expense was $0.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $0.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in interest
expense was due primarily to lower debt levels.      Rental and Miscellaneous Expense, Net    
 Net rental and miscellaneous expense was $0.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $0.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  
   Income Tax Expense      Income tax expense was $5.3
million, or 34.4% of income before income taxes ( Effective Tax Rate ), for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $4.3 million, or 35.1% of income before income taxes, for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The Effective Tax
Rate in the current first quarter was favorably impacted approximately 0.7% by excess tax benefits that prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 were recorded in Capital in excess of par value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
   Net Income      Net income was $10.2 million, or $0.90
per common share basic and $0.89 per share diluted, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to $8.0 million, or $0.71 per common share (basic and diluted), for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
   General      The primary uses of cash are to fund our
current operations, fulfill contractual obligations, pursue our Strategic Plan and repay indebtedness. Also, various uncertainties could result in additional uses of cash. The primary sources of cash are results of operations and availability under
our Credit Agreement, dated February 7, 2008 and subsequently amended most recently in July 2016 (as amended, the  Credit Facility ), that provides a revolving loan commitment and letter of credit subfacility. We anticipate that expected
net cash flow generated from operations and amounts available pursuant to the Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. Our available credit under our Credit Facility has allowed us to devote more funds to
promote our products (especially our  Fisher  and  Orchard Valley Harvest  brands), reinvest in the Company through capital expenditures, develop new products, pay a special cash dividend the past five years, consummate business
acquisitions and explore other growth strategies outlined in our Strategic Plan.    Cash flows from operating activities have historically been driven by
net income but are also significantly influenced by inventory requirements, which can change based upon fluctuations in both quantities and market prices of the various nuts and nut products we buy and sell. Current market trends in nut prices and
crop estimates also impact nut procurement.    The following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and 2016,
respectively (dollars in thousands):      
     Operating Activities   Net cash provided by operating activities was $41.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal
2017 compared to $41.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This increase was due primarily to increased net income, partially offset by an increased use of working capital. 
 Total inventories were $147.2 million at September 29, 2016, a decrease of $9.4 million, or 6.0%, from the inventory balance at June 30, 2016, and a
decrease of $40.7 million, or 21.7%, from the inventory balance at September 24, 2015. The decrease at September 29, 2016 compared to June 30, 2016 was primarily due to lower quantities of pecans on hand partially offset by increased quantities
of other finished goods and work in process inventories on hand. The decrease in inventories at September 29, 2016 compared to September 24, 2015 was primarily driven by lower acquisition costs for walnuts and almonds.  
 Raw nut and dried fruit input stocks, some of which are classified as work in process, increased by 2.0 million pounds, or 4.8%, at September 29, 2016
compared to September 24, 2015. The increase was attributable mainly to increased quantities of walnuts. However, the weighted average cost per pound of raw nut input stocks on hand at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 29.9%
compared to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to lower acquisition costs for walnuts and almonds.     Investing Activities   Cash
used in investing activities, primarily all for capital expenditures, was $3.7 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $7.6 million for the same period last year. We expect total capital expenditures for new equipment,
facility upgrades, and food safety enhancements for fiscal 2017 to be approximately $12.5 million. Absent any material acquisitions or other significant investments, we believe that cash on hand, combined with cash provided by operations and
borrowings available under the Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements for planned capital expenditures.

Table of Contents  

    Financing Activities   Cash used in financing activities was $38.8 million during the first quarter
of fiscal 2017 compared to $33.7 million for the same period last year. We paid a $28.2 million dividend in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Net repayments of short term borrowings under our Credit Facility decreased $22.4 million during
the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due primarily to the payment of the 2016 Special Dividend combined with lower borrowings due to lower nut acquisition costs. 
   Real Estate Matters      In August 2008, we completed
the consolidation of our Chicago-based facilities into the Elgin Site. The Elgin Site includes both an office building and a warehouse. We are currently attempting to find additional tenants for the available space in the office building at the
Elgin Site. Until additional tenant(s) are found, we will not receive the benefit of rental income associated with such space. Approximately 69% of the office building is currently vacant and approximately 75% of the office building has been
built-out. There can be no assurance that we will be able to lease the unoccupied space and further capital expenditures may be necessary to lease the remaining space.  
   Financing Arrangements      On February 7, 2008, we
entered into the Credit Facility with a bank group (the  Bank Lenders ) providing a $117.5 million revolving loan commitment and letter of credit subfacility. Also on February 7, 2008, we entered into a Loan Agreement with an
insurance company (the  Mortgage Lender ) providing us with two term loans, one in the amount of $36.0 million ( Tranche A ) and the other in the amount of $9.0 million ( Tranche B ), for an aggregate amount of $45.0
million (the  Mortgage Facility ).    The Credit Facility, as most recently amended in July 2016, is secured by substantially all of our assets
other than machinery and equipment, real property, and fixtures and matures on July 7, 2021. The Mortgage Facility is secured by mortgages on essentially all of our owned real property located in Elgin, Illinois, Gustine, California and Garysburg,
North Carolina (the  Encumbered Properties ).     Credit Facility   
 At our election, borrowings under the Credit Facility currently accrue interest at either (i) a rate determined pursuant to the administrative agent s
prime rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the amount of loans which may be advanced under the borrowing base calculation, ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% or (ii) a rate based upon the London interbank offered rate
( LIBOR ) plus an applicable margin based upon the borrowing base calculation, ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%.    At September 29, 2016, the weighted
average interest rate for the Credit Facility was 3.50%. The terms of the Credit Facility contain covenants that, among other things, require us to restrict investments, indebtedness, acquisitions and certain sales of assets and limit annual cash
dividends or distributions, transactions with affiliates, redemptions of capital stock and prepayment of indebtedness (if such prepayment, among other things, is of a subordinate debt). If loan availability under the borrowing base calculation falls
below $25.0 million, we will be required to maintain a specified fixed charge coverage ratio, tested on a monthly basis, until loan availability equals or exceeds $25.0 million for three consecutive months. All cash received from customers is
required to be applied against the Credit Facility. The Bank Lenders have the option to accelerate and demand immediate repayment of our obligations under the Credit Facility in the event of default on the payments required under the Credit
Facility, a change in control in the ownership of the Company, non-compliance with the financial covenant or upon the occurrence of other defaults by us under the Credit Facility (including a default under the Mortgage Facility). As of September 29,
2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and we currently expect to be in compliance with the financial covenant in the Credit Facility for the foreseeable future. At September 29, 2016, we had $112.6 million of
available credit under the Credit Facility. If this entire amount were borrowed at September 29, 2016, we would still be in compliance with all restrictive covenants under the Credit Facility.

   Mortgage Facility   
 We are subject to interest rate resets for each of Tranche A and Tranche B. Specifically, on March 1, 2018 (the  Tranche A Reset Date  and the
 Tranche B reset Date ) and every two years thereafter, the Mortgage Lender may reset the interest rates for each of Tranche A and Tranche B, respectively, in its sole and absolute discretion. If the reset interest rate for
Tranche A is unacceptable to us and we (i) do not have sufficient funds to repay the amount due with respect to Tranche A on the Tranche A Reset Date, or (ii) are unable to refinance the amount due with respect to Tranche A on the Tranche A Reset
Date, on terms more favorable than the reset interest rate, then, depending on the extent of the changes in the reset interest rate, our interest expense would increase. 
 The Mortgage Facility matures on March 1, 2023. Tranche A under the Mortgage Facility accrues interest at a fixed interest rate of 7.63% per annum, payable
monthly. As mentioned above, such interest rate may be reset by the Mortgage Lender on the Tranche A Reset Date. Monthly principal payments in the amount of $0.2 million commenced on June 1, 2008. Tranche B under the Mortgage Facility accrues
interest, as reset on March 1, 2016, at a floating rate of the greater of (i) one month LIBOR plus 3.50% per annum or (ii) 4.25%, payable monthly (the  Floating Rate ). The margin on such Floating Rate may be reset by the Mortgage Lender
on each Tranche B Reset Date; provided, however, that the Mortgage Lender may also change the underlying index on each Tranche B Reset Date occurring on or after March 1, 2018. Monthly principal payments in the amount of $0.1 million commenced
on June 1, 2008. We do not currently anticipate that any change in the Floating Rate or the underlying index will have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.  
 The terms of the Mortgage Facility contain covenants that require us to maintain a specified net worth of $110.0 million and maintain the Encumbered
Properties. The Mortgage Lender is entitled to require immediate repayment of our obligations under the Mortgage Facility in the event we default in the payments required under the Mortgage Facility, non-compliance with the covenants or upon the
occurrence of certain other defaults by us under the Mortgage Facility. As of September 29, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Mortgage Facility.  
  Selma Property     In September 2006, we sold our Selma,
Texas properties (the  Selma Properties ) to two related party partnerships for $14.3 million and are leasing them back. The selling price was determined by an independent appraiser to be the fair market value which also approximated our
carrying value. The lease for the Selma Properties has a ten-year term at a fair market value rent with three five-year renewal options. In September 2015, we exercised two of the five-year renewal options which extended the lease term to
September 2026. The lease extension also reduced the monthly lease payment on the Selma Properties, beginning in September 2016, to reflect then current market conditions. One five-year renewal option remains. Also, we have an option
to purchase the Selma Properties from the owner at 95% (100% in certain circumstances) of the then fair market value, but not less than the original $14.3 million purchase price. The provisions of the arrangement are not eligible for sale-leaseback
accounting and the $14.3 million was recorded as a debt obligation. No gain or loss was recorded on the Selma Properties transaction. As of September 29, 2016, $11.4 million of the debt obligation was outstanding.

Exhibit 31.1   
 CERTIFICATION    I, Jeffrey T. Sanfilippo, certify
that:      

2. 
 Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such
statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;        

3. 
 Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;        

4. 
 The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:        

(a) 
 Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;        

(b) 
 Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;        

(c) 
 Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of
the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and        

(d) 
 Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter
in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and
