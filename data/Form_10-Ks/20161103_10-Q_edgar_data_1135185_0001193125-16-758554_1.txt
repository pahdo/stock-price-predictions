    Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements   
  September 30, 2016      1. Basis of
Presentation     Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the holding company, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc.
( AAWW ), and its consolidated subsidiaries. AAWW is the parent company of Atlas Air, Inc. ( Atlas ), Southern Air Holdings, Inc. ( Southern Air ) and Polar Air Cargo LLC ( Old Polar ). Southern Air
was acquired on April 7, 2016 (see Note 4). AAWW is also the parent company of several subsidiaries related to our dry leasing services (collectively referred to as  Titan ). AAWW has a 51% equity interest and 75% voting interest
in Polar Air Cargo Worldwide, Inc. ( Polar ). We record our share of Polar s results under the equity method of accounting.  
 The terms  we,   us,   our,  and the  Company  mean AAWW and all entities included in its consolidated
financial statements.    We provide outsourced aircraft and aviation operating services throughout the world, serving Africa, Asia,
Australia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and South America through: (i) contractual service arrangements, including those through which we provide aircraft to customers and value-added services, including crew, maintenance and insurance
( ACMI ), as well as those through which we provide crew, maintenance and insurance, but not the aircraft ( CMI  (ii) cargo and passenger charter services ( Charter  and (iii) dry leasing aircraft and engines
( Dry Leasing  or  Dry Lease ).   The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes (the
 Financial Statements ) have been prepared in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) requirements for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and consequently exclude certain disclosures normally included
in audited consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The
Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes included in the AAWW Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which includes additional disclosures and a
summary of our significant accounting policies. The December 31, 2015 balance sheet data was derived from that Annual Report. In our opinion, the Financial Statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, necessary
to fairly state the financial position of AAWW and its consolidated subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and shareholders  equity as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
 Our quarterly results are subject to seasonal and other fluctuations, and the operating results for any quarter are therefore not necessarily
indicative of results that may be otherwise expected for the entire year.    Except for per share data, all dollar amounts are in thousands
unless otherwise noted.     2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
   Heavy Maintenance      Except for
engines used on our 747-8F aircraft, we account for heavy maintenance costs for airframes and engines used in our ACMI and Charter segments using the direct expense method. Under this method, heavy maintenance costs are charged to expense upon
induction, based on our best estimate of the costs.    We account for heavy maintenance costs for airframes and engines used in our Dry
Leasing segment and engines used on our 747-8F aircraft using the deferral method. Under this method, we defer the expense recognition of scheduled heavy maintenance events, which are amortized over the estimated period until the next scheduled
heavy maintenance event is required. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, deferred maintenance was $11.1 million and zero, respectively, which was included within Deferred costs and other assets.

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
 In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended its accounting guidance for share-based
compensation. The amended guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as
classification in the statement of cash flows. This amended guidance is effective as of the beginning of 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are still assessing the amended guidance but plan to adopt this guidance on its required
effective date. Upon adoption of this amended guidance, the excess tax benefit associated with share-based compensation, which is currently recognized within equity, will be reflected within income tax expense (benefit) in our consolidated
statements of operations. Additionally, our consolidated statements of cash flows will present such excess tax benefit, which is currently presented as a financing activity, as an operating activity. The impact of adopting this amended
guidance on our consolidated financial statements will be dependent on the timing and intrinsic value of future share-based compensation award vesting.  
 In February 2016, the FASB amended its accounting guidance for leases. The guidance requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities
on the balance sheet arising from leases with terms greater than twelve months. While lessor accounting guidance is relatively unchanged, certain amendments were made to conform with changes made to lessee accounting and recently released
revenue recognition guidance. The new guidance will continue to classify leases as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense and income recognition in the statement of operations. It also requires
additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. The amended guidance is effective as of the beginning of 2019, with early adoption permitted. While we are still assessing the impact the amended guidance will
have on our financial statements, recognizing the right-of-use asset and related lease liability will significantly impact our balance sheet.  
 In May 2014, the FASB amended its accounting guidance for revenue recognition. Subsequently, the FASB has issued several clarifications
and updates. The fundamental principles of the new guidance are that companies should recognize revenue in a manner that reflects the timing of the transfer of services to customers and consideration that a company expects to receive for the
services provided. It also requires additional disclosures necessary for the financial statement users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August
2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year to the beginning of 2018, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt this guidance on its required effective date. While we are still assessing the impact the amended guidance
will have on our financial statements, we expect that an immaterial amount of revenue currently recognized based on flight departure will likely be recognized over time as the services are performed.

   3. Related Parties   
   DHL Investment and Polar      AAWW has
a 51% equity interest and 75% voting interest in Polar. DHL Network Operations (USA), Inc. ( DHL ), a subsidiary of Deutsche Post AG ( DP ), holds a 49% equity interest and a 25% voting interest in Polar. Polar is a
variable interest entity that we do not consolidate because we are not the primary beneficiary as the risks associated with the direct costs of operation are with DHL. Under a 20-year blocked space agreement (the  BSA ), Polar
provides air cargo capacity to DHL. Atlas has several agreements with Polar to provide ACMI, CMI, Dry Leasing, administrative, sales and ground support services to one another. We do not have any financial exposure to fund debt obligations
or operating losses of Polar, except for any liquidated damages that we could incur under these agreements. The following table summarizes our transactions with Polar:

    GATS    
 We hold a 50% interest in GATS GP (BVI) Ltd. ( GATS ), a joint venture with an unrelated third party. The purpose of the joint
venture is to purchase rotable parts and provide repair services for those parts, primarily for our 747-8F aircraft. The joint venture is a variable interest entity that we do not consolidate because we are not the primary beneficiary as we do
not exercise financial control. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our investment in GATS was $20.4 million and $20.7 million, respectively, and our maximum exposure to losses from the entity is limited to our investment, which is
comprised primarily of rotable inventory parts. GATS does not have any third-party debt obligations. We had Accounts payable to GATS of $2.2 million as of September 30, 2016 and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2015.  
  4. Southern Air Holdings Acquisition     On
January 15, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire all the outstanding shares of Southern Air (the  Southern Acquisition ). Southern Air is the parent company of several subsidiaries, including Southern Air
Inc. and Florida West International Airways, Inc. ( Florida West ). The Southern Acquisition provided us with immediate entry into 777 and 737 aircraft operating platforms, with the potential for developing additional business with
existing and new customers of both companies. We believe the platforms provided by these aircraft will augment our ability to offer customers the broadest array of aircraft and operating services for domestic, regional and international
applications. Southern Air currently flies five 777-200LRF and five 737-400F aircraft under CMI agreements for DHL.    The Southern
Acquisition was completed on April 7, 2016. Total consideration of $105.8 million, net of cash acquired, consisted of the following:      
   Tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value as of
the acquisition date. The current fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are considered preliminary until we obtain final information regarding their fair values. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we made
certain measurement-period adjustments, including the finalization of working capital and other adjustments, that resulted in a net decrease to goodwill of $0.2 million. We expect to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but not later
than one year from the acquisition date.    The following table summarizes the preliminary amounts recognized for fair values of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed:      
   The fair values and useful lives assigned to all intangible assets and goodwill are as follows:

  Customer relationship represents the underlying relationship and agreements with DHL. The
trade name relates to the Southern Air brand. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes and is primarily attributable to the expanded market opportunities expected from combining the service offerings of Southern Air with ours, as well as the
employee work force acquired. Southern Air s results of operations and goodwill are reflected in our ACMI segment.    Southern
Air s results of operations have been included in our unaudited consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, our consolidated results include Southern
Air s operating revenue of $26.8 million and $52.5 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred Transaction-related expenses of $3.1 million and $17.2 million, respectively, primarily related
to: certain compensation costs, including employee termination benefits; professional fees; and integration costs associated with the acquisition. A summary of the employee termination benefit liability, which is expected to be paid by the
first quarter of 2018, is as follows:      
   The unaudited pro forma operating revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015
was $448.0 million and $474.1 million, respectively. The unaudited pro forma operating revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $1,337.0 million and $1,416.6 million, respectively. This pro forma
information has been calculated as if the acquisition had taken place on January 1, 2015 and is not necessarily indicative of the net sales that actually would have been achieved. This information includes adjustments to conform with our
accounting policies. The earnings of Southern Air were not material and, accordingly, pro forma and actual earnings information have not been presented.  
 As part of integrating Southern Air, management decided and committed to pursue a plan to sell Florida West. As a result, the financial
results for Florida West are presented as a discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities of Florida West are classified as held for sale. The aggregate carrying value of Florida West s assets held for sale, consisting primarily of
goodwill, was $5.0 million at September 30, 2016, which was included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. The sale of Florida West is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016.  
  5. Special Charge     The carrying value of
five CF6-80 engines held for sale at December 31, 2015 was $7.7 million. During the first quarter of 2016, we classified five additional CF6-80 engines as held for sale, recognized an impairment loss of $6.5 million and ceased depreciation on
the engines. Seven engines were traded in during the first three quarters of 2016. The remaining three engines had a carrying value of $4.6 million at September 30, 2016 and are expected to be sold during the fourth quarter of 2016.  
  6. Amazon     In May 2016, we entered into
certain agreements with Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiary, Amazon Fulfillment Services, Inc., (collectively  Amazon ), which will involve, among other things, CMI operation of 20 Boeing 767-300 freighter aircraft for Amazon by Atlas, as
well as Dry Leasing by Titan. The Dry Leases will have a term of ten years, while the CMI operations will be for seven years (with an option for Amazon to extend the term to a total of ten years). The first aircraft was placed in service
during the third quarter of 2016 and the remainder are expected to be placed in service by the end of 2018.    In conjunction with these
agreements, we granted Amazon a warrant providing the right to acquire up to 20% of our outstanding common shares, after giving effect to the issuance of shares pursuant to the warrants, at an exercise price of $37.50 per share. A portion of
the warrant, representing the right to purchase 3.75 million shares, vested immediately upon issuance of the warrant and the remainder of the warrant, representing the right to purchase 3.75 million shares, will vest in increments of 375,000 as the
lease and operation of each of the 11 th  through 20 th  aircraft commences. The warrant will be exercisable in accordance with its terms
through 2021.   The agreements also provide incentives for future growth of the relationship as Amazon may increase its business with
us. In that regard, we granted Amazon a warrant to acquire up to an additional 10% of our outstanding common shares,  
      12  

Table of Contents  

after giving effect to the issuance of shares pursuant to the warrants, for an exercise price of $37.50 per share. This warrant to purchase 3.75 million shares will vest in conjunction with
payments by Amazon for additional business with us. The warrant will be exercisable in accordance with its terms through 2023.   At a
special meeting on September 20, 2016, the Company s shareholders, by a vote of approximately 99.9% of the votes cast, approved the issuance of warrants to acquire up to 30% of our outstanding common shares. This approval constituted a
change in control, as defined under certain of the Company s benefit plans. As a result, we recognized $26.2 million in expense, including accelerated compensation expense for restricted and performance share and cash awards, during the
three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. The share-based portion of the compensation expense was $11.6 million. As of September 30, 2016, no warrants have been exercised.  
 The $92.9 million fair value of the vested portion of the warrant issued to Amazon as of May 4, 2016 was recorded as a warrant liability
within Financial instruments and other liabilities (the  Amazon Warrant ). The initial fair value of the warrant was recognized as a customer incentive asset within Deferred costs and other assets, net and is being amortized as a
reduction of revenue in proportion to the amount of revenue recognized over the terms of the Dry Leases and CMI agreements. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, we amortized $0.2 million of the customer incentive
asset. The balance of the customer incentive asset, net of amortization, was $92.7 million as of September 30, 2016.    The Amazon
Warrant liability is marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in Other non-operating expenses. We utilized a Monte Carlo simulation approach to estimate the fair value of the Amazon Warrant which
requires inputs such as our common stock price, strike price, estimated stock price volatility and risk-free interest rate, among other assumptions. We recognized an unrealized loss of $1.5 million and a net unrealized gain of $25.0 million on
the Amazon Warrant during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The fair value of the Amazon Warrant liability was $67.9 million as of September 30, 2016.  
  7. Accrued Liabilities     Accrued
liabilities consisted of the following as of:      
    8. Debt       Term Loans
and Capital Leases      In February 2016, we borrowed $14.8 million related to the conversion of a 767-300BDSF aircraft under an
eight-year term loan with a final payment of $3.8 million due in February 2024 (the  First 2016 Term Loan ). The First 2016 Term Loan, which is secured by a mortgage against aircraft tail number N642GT, contains customary covenants and
events of default and accrues interest at a fixed rate of 3.19%, with principal and interest payable monthly.    In June 2016, we borrowed
$70.0 million under a five-year term loan with a final payment of $30.2 million due in June 2021 (the  Second 2016 Term Loan ). The Second 2016 Term Loan, which is secured by a mortgage against six spare GEnx engines, contains customary
covenants and events of default and accrues interest at an initial variable rate of 2.93%, with principal and interest payable monthly. The Second 2016 Term Loan was converted to a fixed rate loan in July 2016 at a rate of 3.12%, with principal
and interest payable quarterly.    In September 2016, we entered into a capital lease, with an option and the intention to purchase, for a
767-300 passenger aircraft (tail number N661GT), which expires in February 2017. The present value of the future minimum lease payments at September 30, 2016 was $10.7 million.

    Convertible Notes    
 In June 2015, we issued $224.5 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes (the  Convertible Notes ) in an
underwritten public offering. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and accrue interest payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year at a fixed rate of 2.25%. The Convertible Notes will mature on
June 1, 2022, unless earlier converted or repurchased pursuant to their terms. Proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes were used to refinance higher-rate debt related to five 747-400 freighter aircraft that had an average cash
coupon of 8.1%. As of September 30, 2016, the remaining life of the Convertible Notes is 6.0 years and consisted of the following:      

(1) 
 Included in Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.    
 The following table presents the amount of interest expense recognized related to the Convertible Notes:  
   
    9. Income Taxes   
 Our effective income tax rates were an expense of 230.8% and a benefit of 49.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015, respectively. Our effective income tax rates were 60.3% and 14.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The effective rate for the three and nine month period ended on September 30, 2016
differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate principally due to nondeductible expenses resulting from a change in control, as defined under certain of the Company s benefit plans, related to the Amazon transaction (see Note 6). The
effective rate for the nine month period ended on September 30, 2015 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due to nonrecurring tax benefits related to extraterritorial income ( ETI ) and the favorable resolution of an income tax
examination. In addition, the effective rates for all periods differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due to the income tax impact of foreign operations taxed at different rates, our assertion to indefinitely reinvest the net earnings of
certain foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S., U.S. state income taxes, routine nondeductible expenses, adjustments to our liability for uncertain tax positions, and the relationship of these items to our projected operating results for the
year. For interim accounting purposes, we recognize income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate.     10. Financial Instruments   
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date (exit price). Inputs used to measure fair value are classified in the following hierarchy:      

Level 1  
    
 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  

Level 2  
    
 Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or inactive quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets;  

Level 3  
    
 Unobservable inputs reflecting assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.  
 
      14

  We endeavor to utilize the best available information to measure fair value.  
 The carrying value of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and Restricted cash is based on cost, which approximates fair value.
   Long-term investments consist of debt securities for which we have both the ability and the intent to hold until maturity. These
investments are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. The fair value of our Long-term investments is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using the contractual cash flows of the investments and a discount rate
derived from unadjusted quoted interest rates for debt securities of comparable risk. Such debt securities represent investments in Pass-Through Trust Certificates ( PTCs ) related to enhanced equipment trust certificates
( EETCs ) issued by Atlas in 1998, 1999 and 2000.   The fair value of our term loans, notes guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank
of the United States ( Ex-Im Bank ) and EETCs are based on a discounted cash flow analysis using current borrowing rates for instruments with similar terms.  
 The fair value of our Convertible Notes is based on unadjusted quoted market prices for these securities.  
 The fair value of the Amazon Warrant is based on a Monte Carlo simulation which requires inputs such as our common stock price, strike price,
estimated stock price volatility, and risk-free interest rate, among other assumptions.    The following table summarizes the carrying
value, estimated fair value and classification of our financial instruments as of:

    11. Segment Reporting   
 Our business is organized into three operating segments based on our service offerings: ACMI, Charter and Dry Leasing. All segments are
directly or indirectly engaged in the business of air transportation services but have different commercial and economic characteristics. Each operating segment is separately reviewed by our chief operating decision maker to assess operating
results and make resource allocation decisions. We do not aggregate our operating segments and, therefore, our operating segments are our reportable segments. 
 We use an economic performance metric ( Direct Contribution ) that shows the profitability of each segment after allocation of
direct operating and ownership costs. Direct Contribution represents Income from continuing operations before income taxes excluding the following: Special charges, Transaction-related expenses, nonrecurring items, Losses (gains) on the
disposal of aircraft, Losses on early extinguishment of debt, Unrealized losses (gains) on financial instruments, Gains on investments and Unallocated income and expenses, net. Direct operating and ownership costs include crew costs,
maintenance, fuel, ground operations, sales costs, aircraft rent, interest expense on the portion of debt used for financing aircraft, interest income on debt securities and aircraft depreciation. Unallocated income and expenses, net include
corporate overhead, nonaircraft depreciation, noncash expenses and income, interest expense on the portion of debt used for general corporate purposes, interest income on nondebt securities, capitalized interest, foreign exchange gains and losses,
other revenue and other non-operating costs.    The following table sets forth Operating Revenue and Direct Contribution for our reportable
segments reconciled to Operating Income and Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes:

We are exposed to a concentration of revenue from the U.S. Military Air Mobility Command (the  AMC )
and Polar (see Note 3 for further discussion regarding Polar). No other customer accounted for more than 10.0% of our Total Operating Revenue. Revenue from the AMC was $116.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $122.5
million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue from the AMC was $346.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $326.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Accounts receivable from the AMC
were $21.3 million and $26.3 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We have not experienced any credit issues with either of these customers.  
  12. Labor and Legal Proceedings       Labor
     Pilots of Atlas and Southern Air, and flight dispatchers of Atlas and Polar are represented by the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters (the  IBT ). We have a five-year collective bargaining agreement ( CBA ) with our Atlas pilots, which became amendable in September 2016 and a four-year CBA with the Southern Air pilots, which will become amendable
in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also have a five-year CBA with our Atlas and Polar dispatchers, which becomes amendable in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
 After we completed the acquisition of Southern Air in April 2016, we informed the IBT of our intention to pursue a complete operational merger
of Atlas and Southern Air. Pursuant to the merger provisions in both the Atlas and Southern Air CBAs, joint negotiations for a single CBA for Atlas and Southern Air can commence immediately. Once a seniority list is presented to us by the
unions, it triggers an agreed-upon time frame to negotiate a new joint CBA with any unresolved issues submitted to binding arbitration. After the process began, an application was filed with the National Mediation Board ( NMB ) by the
Atlas pilots to facilitate the negotiation process. We have opposed the mediation application as it is not in accordance with the merger provisions in the parties  existing CBAs, which have a defined and streamlined process for negotiating
a joint CBA when a merger occurs, as in the case with the Atlas and Southern Air merger. We are currently awaiting the NMB s decision and are in ongoing discussions with the union on how the merger process will proceed.  
 We are subject to risks of work interruption or stoppage as permitted by the Railway Labor Act of 1926 (the  Railway Labor Act ) and
may incur additional administrative expenses associated with union representation of our employees.      Matters Related to Alleged Pricing Practices
     The Company and Old Polar were named defendants, along with a number of other cargo carriers, in several class actions in the U.S.
arising from allegations about the pricing practices of Old Polar and a number of air cargo carriers. These actions were all centralized in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Polar was later joined as an
additional defendant. The consolidated complaint alleged, among other things, that the defendants, including the Company and Old Polar, manipulated the market price for air cargo services sold domestically and abroad through the use of
surcharges, in violation of U.S., state, and European Union antitrust laws. The suit sought treble damages and attorneys  fees. 
 On January 7, 2016, the Company, Old Polar, and Polar entered into a settlement agreement to settle all claims by participating class members
against the Company, Old Polar and Polar. The Company, Polar, and Old Polar deny any wrongdoing, and there is no admission of any wrongdoing in the settlement agreement. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Company, Old Polar and Polar
have agreed to make installment payments over three years to settle the plaintiffs  claims, with payments of $35.0 million paid on January 15, 2016, $35.0 million due on or before January 15,  
      17

2017, and $30.0 million due on or before January 15, 2018. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York issued an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement on January
12, 2016. On October 6, 2016, the final judgment was issued and the settlement was approved.    In the United Kingdom, several groups of
named claimants have brought suit against British Airways in connection with the same alleged pricing practices at issue in the proceedings described above and are seeking damages allegedly arising from that conduct. British Airways has filed claims
in the lawsuit against Old Polar and a number of air cargo carriers for contribution should British Airways be found liable to claimants. Old Polar s formal statement of defense was filed on March 2, 2015. On October 14, 2015, the U.K. Court of
Appeal released decisions favorable to the defendant and contributory defendants on two matters under appeal. Permission has been sought to appeal the U.K. Court of Appeal s decisions to the U.K. Supreme Court. In December 2015, certain
claimants settled with British Airways removing a significant portion of the claim against British Airways and therefore reducing the potential contribution required by the other airlines, including Old Polar. On December 16, 2015, the European
General Court released decisions annulling decisions that the European Commission made against the majority of the air cargo carriers. The European Commission has not appealed the General Court decision, but may still reopen its investigation or
reissue a revised decision, either of which would have a significant impact on the proceedings in the U.K. court. Future procedures, including the pretrial disclosure process, are continuing. We are unable to reasonably predict the outcome of the
litigation.    In the Netherlands, Stichting Cartel Compensation, successor in interest to claims of various shippers, has filed suit in the
district court in Amsterdam against British Airways, KLM, Martinair, Air France, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines seeking recovery for damages purportedly arising from the same pricing practices at issue in the proceedings described above. In
response, British Airways, KLM, Martinair, Air France and Lufthansa filed third-party indemnification lawsuits against Old Polar and Polar seeking indemnification in the event the defendants are found to be liable in the main proceedings. Old Polar
and Polar entered their initial court appearances on September 30, 2015. Various procedural issues are undergoing court review. Like the U.K. proceedings, the Netherlands proceedings are likely to be affected by the European Commission s
response to the European General Court decisions of December 16, 2015. We are unable to reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation. 
 If the Company, Old Polar or Polar were to incur an unfavorable outcome in connection with the U.K. or Netherlands proceedings, such outcome
may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We are unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss for such matters at this time.  
   Brazilian Customs Claim      Old Polar
was cited for two alleged customs violations in Sao Paulo, Brazil, relating to shipments of goods dating back to 1999 and 2000. Each claim asserts that goods listed on the flight manifest of two separate Old Polar scheduled service flights were not
on board the aircraft upon arrival and therefore were improperly brought into Brazil. The two claims, which also seek unpaid customs duties, taxes and penalties from the date of the alleged infraction, are approximately $9.3 million in aggregate
based on September 30, 2016 exchange rates.   In both cases, we believe that the amounts claimed are substantially overstated due to a
calculation error when considering the type and amount of goods allegedly missing, among other things. Furthermore, we may seek appropriate indemnity from the shipper in each claim as may be feasible. In the pending claim for one of the cases,
we have received an administrative decision dismissing the claim in its entirety, which remains subject to a mandatory appeal by the Brazil customs authorities. As required to defend such claims, we have made deposits pending resolution of these
matters. The balances were $4.9 million as of September 30, 2016 and $3.8 million as of December 31, 2015, and are included in Deposits and other assets.  
 We are currently defending these and other Brazilian customs claims and the ultimate disposition of these claims, either individually or in
the aggregate, is not expected to materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.      Accruals    
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a remaining accrual of $65.0 million related to the U.S. class action settlement. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a net accrual of $6.5 million within Other operating expense in the consolidated statement of operations related to pending litigation outside of the U.S.

    Other    
 We have certain other contingencies incident to the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate disposition of such
other contingencies is not expected to materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.     13. Earnings Per Share   
 Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) represent income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the measurement period. Diluted EPS represent income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the measurement period while also giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Anti-dilutive shares related to warrants and stock options that were out of the money and excluded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 3.0
million. Anti-dilutive shares related to restricted share units and warrants that were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were 0.4 million.  
 The calculations of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:      
   The calculation of EPS does not include restricted share units and warrants in which performance or market
conditions were not satisfied of 7.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and 0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  14. Commitments     As of September 30,
2016, our estimated payments remaining for flight equipment purchase commitments range between $160.0 to $180.0 million, of which $30.0 to $40.0 million are expected to be made during the remainder of 2016.

   15. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)   
 The following table summarizes the components of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):  
   
     Interest Rate Derivatives    
 As of September 30, 2016, there was $8.6 million of unamortized net realized loss before taxes remaining in Accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) related to terminated forward-starting interest rate swaps, which had been designated as cash flow hedges to effectively fix the interest rates on two 747-8F financings in 2011 and three 777-200LRF financings in 2014. The net loss
is amortized and reclassified into Interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt. Net realized losses reclassified into earnings were $0.4 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Net realized losses reclassified into earnings were $1.3 million and $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net realized losses expected to be reclassified into earnings within the
next 12 months are $1.7 million as of September 30, 2016.

this report and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Background   
  Certain Terms - Glossary     The following
represents terms and statistics specific to our business and industry. They are used by management to evaluate and measure operations, results, productivity and efficiency.      

Block Hour 
    
 The time interval between when an aircraft departs the terminal until it arrives at the destination terminal.  

C Check 
    
 High-level or  heavy  airframe maintenance checks, which are more intensive in scope than Line Maintenance and are generally performed between 18 and 24 months depending on aircraft type.  

D Check 
    
 High-level or  heavy  airframe maintenance checks, which are the most extensive in scope and are generally performed every six and eight years depending on aircraft type.  

Heavy Maintenance 
    
 Scheduled maintenance activities, which are the most extensive in scope and are primarily based on time or usage intervals, include, but are not limited to, C Checks, D Checks and engine overhauls. In addition, unscheduled
engine repairs involving the removal of the engine from the aircraft are considered to be heavy maintenance.  

Line Maintenance 
    
 Unscheduled maintenance to rectify events occurring during normal day-to-day operations.  

Non-heavy Maintenance 
    
 Discrete maintenance activities for the overhaul and repair of specific aircraft components, including landing gear, auxiliary power units and engine thrust reversers.

    Business Overview   
 We are a leading global provider of outsourced aircraft and aviation operating services. We operate the world s largest fleet of 747
freighters and, with our recent acquisition of Southern Air, provide customers the broadest array of 747, 777, 767, 757 and 737 aircraft for domestic, regional and international applications. We also own and dry lease a portfolio of aircraft,
including six 777 freighters. We provide unique value to our customers by giving them access to highly reliable new production freighters that deliver the lowest unit cost in the marketplace combined with outsourced aircraft operating services
that we believe lead the industry in terms of quality and global scale. Our customers include express delivery providers, e-commerce retailers, airlines, freight forwarders, the U.S. military and charter brokers. We provide global services
with operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and South America.    Our primary service offerings
include the following:      

ACMI, whereby we provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and Yield risk. In
addition, customers are responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;        

CMI, which is part of our ACMI business segment, whereby we provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of crew, maintenance and insurance, but not the
aircraft. Customers assume fuel, demand and Yield risk. In addition, customers are responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;    

Charter, whereby we provide cargo and passenger aircraft charter services to customers, including the AMC, brokers, freight forwarders, direct shippers, airlines, sports teams and fans, and private charter
customers. The customer pays a fixed charter fee that includes fuel, insurance, landing fees, navigation fees and most other operational fees and costs; and    
      21  

Table of Contents

 We look to achieve our growth plans and enhance shareholder value by:  

Delivering superior service quality to our valued customers;        

Focusing on securing attractive long-term customer contracts;        

Aggressively managing our fleet with a focus on leading-edge aircraft;        

Driving significant and ongoing productivity improvements;        

Selectively pursuing and evaluating future acquisitions and alliances; while        

Appropriately managing capital allocation.      See  Business Overview  and
 Business Strategy  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.     Business Developments   
 Our ACMI results for the first three quarters of 2016, compared with 2015, were impacted by the following events:  

In March 2015, we began ACMI flying one additional 747-8F aircraft for DHL following its transition from Panalpina Air   Ocean Ltd. The aircraft initially replaced a 747-400F aircraft.   

In July 2015, we began ACMI flying one additional 747-400F aircraft for DHL, increasing the number of 747 freighter aircraft in ACMI service for DHL to thirteen.   

In December 2015 and February 2016, we began CMI flying for DHL two 767-300 freighter aircraft, Dry Leased from Titan, in DHL s North American network, increasing the number of freighter aircraft in CMI service for
DHL to twelve.        

In August 2016, we began CMI flying for Amazon the first of 20 Boeing 767-300 freighter aircraft Dry Leased from Titan. The remaining aircraft are expected to be placed in service by the end of 2018.
     Charter results for the first three quarters of 2016 were impacted, compared with 2015, by a decline in Yield due to the
U.S. West Coast port disruption in 2015. This impact was partially offset by an increase in Block Hours during 2016, reflecting increased cargo and passenger demand from the AMC.  
 In December 2015 and February 2016, we began Dry Leasing two 767-300 converted freighter aircraft to DHL on a long-term basis. In March
2016, we also Dry Leased a 737-800 passenger aircraft on a long-term basis to a customer following its scheduled return. In August 2016, we began Dry Leasing one 767-300 converted freighter aircraft to Amazon on a long-term basis.

   Operating Revenue   
 The following table compares our Operating Revenue for the three months ended September 30 (in thousands):  
   
    ACMI revenue  increased $9.3 million, or 4.7%, primarily due to increased flying, partially offset by
reduced Revenue per Block Hour. ACMI Block Hours were 39,448 in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 32,072 in 2015, an increase of 7,376 Block Hours, or 23.0%. The increase in Block Hours reflects the impact from the Southern
Acquisition and increased 767 CMI flying, partially offset by the temporary redeployment of 747-8F aircraft to the Charter segment. ACMI Revenue per Block Hour was $5,230 for the third quarter of 2016, compared with $6,143 in 2015, a decrease
of $913 per Block Hour, or 14.9%. The decrease in Revenue per Block Hour reflects the 777-200 and 737-400 CMI flying from the Southern Acquisition, increased 767 CMI flying and the temporary redeployment of 747-8F aircraft to Charter. 
  Charter revenue  decreased $13.0 million, or 5.8%, primarily due to a decrease in Revenue per Block Hour, partially offset by an
increase in Block Hours. Charter Revenue per Block Hour was $14,858 for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $18,252 in 2015, a decrease of $3,394 per Block Hour, or 18.6%. This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in fuel
prices in 2016 and a decline in market rates, partially offset by the impact from the temporary redeployment of 747-8F aircraft from ACMI. Charter Block Hours were 14,271 in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 12,331 in 2015, an increase of
1,940 Block Hours, or 15.7%. The increase in Charter Block Hours was primarily driven by increased cargo and passenger demand from the AMC.  
  Dry Leasing revenue  increased $2.0 million, or 8.3%, primarily due to the placement of two 767-300 converted freighter aircraft with
DHL in December 2015 and February 2016, and one 767-300 converted freighter aircraft with Amazon in August 2016.     Operating Expenses   
 The following table compares our Operating Expenses for the three months ended September 30 (in thousands):  
   
   NM represents year-over-year changes that are not meaningful.  
  Salaries, wages and benefits  increased $39.5 million, or 45.8%, primarily driven by $26.2 million of expense for a change in control,
as defined under certain benefit plans, related to the Amazon transaction (see Note 6), the impact of the Southern Acquisition and increased crewmember costs related to Amazon and other fleet growth initiatives.  
      24  

Table of Contents  

   Aircraft fuel  decreased $21.9 million, or 25.1%, primarily due to fuel price decreases,
partially offset by increased fuel consumption. The average fuel price per gallon for the Charter business was $1.61 for the third quarter of 2016, compared with $2.38 in 2015, a decrease of 32.4%. Fuel consumption increased 4.1 million
gallons, or 11.1%, reflecting the increase in Charter Block Hours operated. We do not incur fuel expense in our ACMI or Dry Leasing businesses as the cost of fuel is borne by the customer.  
  Maintenance, materials and repairs  increased $7.9 million, or 18.8%, primarily reflecting increases of $3.6 million for 747-400
aircraft and $2.4 million for 777-200 aircraft. Heavy Maintenance on 747-400 aircraft increased $4.4 million primarily due to an increase in the number of D Checks. Heavy Maintenance expense on 747-8F aircraft decreased $1.6 million
primarily due to a decrease in unscheduled engine repairs. Line Maintenance increased by $1.8 million on 747-8F aircraft due to increased flying and additional repairs performed and $1.5 million on 777-200 aircraft related to the Southern
Acquisition. Non-heavy Maintenance on 747-400 aircraft decreased $1.0 million as a result of lower costs per event. Heavy airframe maintenance checks and engine overhauls impacting Maintenance, materials and repairs for the three months
ended September 30 were:      
    Depreciation and amortization  increased $4.7 million, or 14.4%, primarily due to additional aircraft
operating in 2016.     Travel  increased $4.4 million, or 16.0%, primarily due to increased flying due to the Southern Acquisition.
    Navigation fees, landing fees and other rent  decreased $9.8 million, or 38.5%, primarily due to a reduction in purchased capacity
from the subcontracting of certain Charter flights.     Special charge  in 2015 resulted from the early termination of high-rate
operating leases for two engines.     Transaction-related expenses  in 2016 relate to the Southern Acquisition and Amazon transaction,
which primarily include: certain compensation costs, including employee termination benefits; professional fees; and integration costs (see Notes 4 and 6).  
  Non-operating Expenses (Income)     The
following table compares our Non-operating Expenses (Income) for the three months ended September 30 (in thousands):      
    Interest income  decreased $0.7 million, or 35.5%, primarily due to a decrease in our investments in
PTCs.    Interest expense  decreased $0.8 million, or 3.4%, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates resulting from the
refinancing of higher-rate EETCs with lower-rate Convertible Notes in 2015 and a reduction in our average debt balances, reflecting payments of debt.  
  Loss on early extinguishment of debt  was related to the refinancing of five EETCs with lower-rate Convertible Notes during the third
quarter of 2015.     Unrealized loss (gain) on financial instruments  represents the change in fair value of the Amazon Warrant during
the third quarter of 2016.

   Gain on investments  was related to the early redemption of certain PTC investments
resulting from the refinancing of five EETCs with lower-rate Convertible Notes during the third quarter of 2015.     Income
taxes . Our effective income tax rates were an expense of 230.8% and a benefit of 49.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to nondeductible expenses resulting from a change in control, as defined under certain of the Company s benefit plans, related to the Amazon transaction. The
effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to an income tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of an income tax examination. The effective income
tax rates for both periods were impacted by our assertion to indefinitely reinvest the net earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S.  
  Segments     The following table compares
the Direct Contribution of our reportable segments (see Note 11 for the reconciliation to Operating Income) for the three months ended September 30 (in thousands):      
     ACMI Segment    
 ACMI Direct Contribution increased $4.6 million, or 9.8%, primarily due to the impact from the Southern Acquisition, partially offset by the
temporary redeployment of 747-8F aircraft to the Charter segment and higher Heavy Maintenance expense.     Charter Segment    
 Charter Direct Contribution increased $3.5 million, or 11.7%, primarily due to the temporary redeployment of 747-8F aircraft from the ACMI
segment and increased cargo and passenger demand from the AMC, partially offset by a decline in market rates and higher Heavy Maintenance expense.  
   Dry Leasing Segment      Dry Leasing
Direct Contribution was relatively unchanged.      Unallocated income and expenses, net    
 Unallocated income and expenses, net increased $32.7 million, or 67.9%, primarily driven by $26.2 million of expense for a change in control,
as defined under certain benefit plans, related to the Amazon transaction (see Note 6) and the impact of the Southern Acquisition.     Nine Months Ended

   Operating Revenue   
 The following table compares our Operating Revenue for the nine months ended September 30 (in thousands):  
   
    ACMI revenue  increased $25.5 million, or 4.4%, primarily due to increased flying, partially offset by
reduced Revenue per Block Hour. ACMI Block Hours were 108,839 for the first three quarters of 2016, compared with 92,490 in 2015, an increase of 16,349 Block Hours, or 17.7%. The increase in Block Hours reflects the impact from the
Southern Acquisition and increased 767 CMI flying, partially offset by the temporary redeployment of 747-8F aircraft to the Charter segment. ACMI Revenue per Block Hour was $5,520 for the first three quarters of 2016, compared with $6,220 in
2015, a decrease of $700 per Block Hour, or 11.3%. The decrease in Revenue per Block Hour primarily reflects the 777-200 and 737-400 CMI flying from the Southern Acquisition, increased 767 CMI flying and the temporary redeployment of 747-8F
aircraft to Charter in the first three quarters of 2016.     Charter revenue  decreased $63.8 million, or 9.4%, primarily due to a
decrease in Revenue per Block Hour, partially offset by an increase in Block Hours. Charter Revenue per Block Hour was $15,634 for the first three quarters of 2016 compared with $18,251 in 2015, a decrease of $2,617 per Block Hour, or
14.3%. This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in fuel prices in 2016 and the impact of higher rates resulting from the U.S. West Coast port disruption in 2015, partially offset by the temporary redeployment of 747-8F aircraft from
the ACMI segment. Charter Block Hours were 39,451 for the first three quarters of 2016 compared with 37,294 in 2015, an increase of 2,157 Block Hours, or 5.8%. The increase in Charter Block Hours was primarily driven by an increase in
cargo and passenger demand from the AMC, partially offset by a reduction in commercial cargo demand.     Dry Leasing revenue  decreased
$4.1 million, or 4.9%, primarily due to lower revenue from maintenance payments to us in 2016 related to the scheduled return of aircraft. Revenue from maintenance payments is based on the maintenance condition of the aircraft at the end of the
lease. Partially offsetting this decrease was revenue from the placement of two 767-300 converted freighter aircraft with DHL in December 2015 and February 2016, and one 767-300 converted freighter aircraft with Amazon in August 2016.  
  Operating Expenses     The following table
compares our Operating Expenses for the nine months ended September 30 (in thousands):      
 
      28  

Table of Contents  

   Salaries, wages and benefits  increased $59.3 million, or 22.6%, primarily driven by $26.2
million of expense for a change in control, as defined under certain benefit plans, related to the Amazon transaction (see Note 6), the impact of the Southern Acquisition and increased crewmember costs related to Amazon and other fleet growth
initiatives.     Aircraft fuel  decreased $72.2 million, or 27.5%, primarily due to fuel price decreases, partially offset by increased
fuel consumption. The average fuel price per gallon for the Charter business was $1.69 for the first three quarters of 2016, compared with $2.40 in 2015, a decrease of 29.6%. Fuel consumption increased by 2.9 million gallons, or 2.7%,
primarily reflecting the increase in Charter Block Hours operated. We do not incur fuel expense in our ACMI or Dry Leasing businesses as the cost of fuel is borne by the customer.  
  Maintenance, materials and repairs  increased by $20.1 million, or 14.1%, primarily reflecting increases of $6.4 million for  747-8F  aircraft, $4.8 million for 767 aircraft and $4.7 million for 777-200 aircraft. Heavy Maintenance expense on 747-400 aircraft increased $4.9 million primarily due to an increase in the number of C and D
Checks, partially offset by a decrease in the number of engine overhauls. Heavy Maintenance expense on 767 aircraft increased $1.4 million primarily due to an increase in the number of C Checks. Line Maintenance increased by $6.1 million
on 747-8F aircraft, $3.2 million on 767 aircraft and $2.2 million on 747-400 aircraft due to increased flying and additional repairs performed. Line maintenance also increased $3.0 million on 777-200 aircraft related to the Southern
Acquisition. Non-heavy Maintenance on 747-400 aircraft decreased $4.2 million as a result of lower costs per event. Heavy airframe maintenance checks and engine overhauls impacting Maintenance, materials and reports for the first three
quarters of 2016 and 2015 were:      
    Depreciation and amortization  increased $13.0 million, or 13.4%, primarily due to additional aircraft
operating in 2016.     Aircraft rent  increased $1.6 million, or 1.5%, primarily due to an increase in short-term engine leases.  
  Travel  increased $22.1 million, or 30.6%, primarily due to higher rates related to crewmember travel and increased flying due to the
Southern Acquisition.     Passenger and ground handling services  increased $2.8 million, or 4.5%, primarily due to increased flying.
    Navigation fees, landing fees and other rent  decreased $15.2 million, or 21.2%, primarily due to a reduction in purchased capacity
from the subcontracting of certain Charter flights.     Special charge  in 2016 primarily represents a $6.5 million loss on engines
held for sale (see Note 5). We may sell additional flight equipment, which could result in additional charges in future periods. Special charge in 2015 resulted from the early termination of high-rate operating leases for two engines.  
  Transaction-related expenses  in 2016 relate to the Southern Acquisition and Amazon transaction, which primarily include: certain
compensation costs, including employee termination benefits; professional fees; and integration costs (see Notes 4 and 6).     Other 
increased $9.3 million, or 9.6%, primarily due to an accrual for legal matters (see Note 12), the Southern Acquisition and increased flight simulator expense driven by increased crew training.

   Non-operating Expenses (Income)   
 The following table compares our Non-operating Expenses (Income) for the nine months ended September 30 (in thousands):  
   
    Interest income  decreased $6.6 million, or 60.5%, primarily due to a decrease in PTCs.  
  Interest expense  decreased $8.1 million, or 11.3%, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates resulting from the refinancing of
higher-rate EETCs with lower-rate Convertible Notes in 2015 and a reduction in our average debt balances, reflecting payments of debt.  
  Loss on early extinguishment of debt  was related to the refinancing of five EETCs with lower-rate Convertible Notes during the third
quarter of 2015.     Unrealized loss (gain) on financial instruments  represents the change in fair value of the Amazon Warrant during
2016.     Gain on investments  was related to the early redemption of certain PTC investments resulting from the refinancing of five
EETCs with lower-rate Convertible Notes during the third quarter of 2015.     Income taxes . Our effective income tax rates were
60.3% and 14.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to
nondeductible expenses resulting from a change in control, as defined under certain of the Company s benefit plans, related to the Amazon transaction. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 differed from
the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to income tax benefits related to ETI and to the favorable resolution of an income tax examination. The effective income tax rates for both periods were impacted by our assertion to indefinitely
reinvest the net earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S.     Segments   
 The following table compares the Direct Contribution for our reportable segments (see Note 11 to our Financial Statements for the
reconciliation to Operating Income) for the nine months ended September 30 (in thousands):      
 
      30  

Table of Contents  

    ACMI Segment    
 ACMI Direct Contribution decreased $16.2 million, or 11.7%, primarily due to increases in crew costs related to Amazon and other fleet growth
initiatives, the temporary redeployment of 747-8F aircraft to the Charter segment, payments received in 2015 related to a customer s return of aircraft and higher Heavy Maintenance expense. Partially offsetting these items was additional
contribution resulting from the Southern Acquisition.      Charter Segment    
 Charter Direct Contribution decreased $6.4 million or 7.5%, primarily due to the impact of the U.S. West Coast port disruption in 2015 and
increases in crew costs related to fleet growth initiatives and higher Heavy Maintenance expense. Partially offsetting these decreases was the temporary redeployment of 747-8F aircraft from the ACMI segment and an increase in passenger and
cargo demand from the AMC.      Dry Leasing Segment    
 Dry Leasing Direct Contribution decreased $9.4 million, or 27.6%, primarily due to lower revenue from maintenance payments to us in 2016
related to the scheduled return of aircraft. Partially offsetting this decrease was revenue related to the placement of two 767-300 converted freighter aircraft with DHL in December 2015 and February 2016, and one 767-300 converted freighter
aircraft with Amazon in August 2016.      Unallocated income and expenses, net    
 Unallocated income and expenses, net increased $44.5 million, or 31.2%, primarily driven by $26.2 million of expense for a change in control,
as defined under certain benefit plans, related to the Amazon transaction (see Note 6), the impact of the Southern Acquisition, an accrual for legal matters and increases in noncash expenses related to our Convertible Notes. 
  Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures   
 To supplement our Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures to assist in the
evaluation of our business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted Income from continuing operations, net of taxes and Adjusted Diluted EPS from continuing operations, net of taxes, which exclude certain noncash income
and expenses, and items impacting year-over-year comparisons of our results. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for Income from continuing operations, net of taxes and Diluted EPS from continuing operations, which are the most directly comparable measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  
 We use these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of our ongoing operations and in planning and forecasting future
periods. We believe that these adjusted measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide meaningful supplemental information to assist investors and analysts in
understanding our business results and assessing our prospects for future performance.    The following is a reconciliation of Income (loss)
from continuing operations, net of taxes and Diluted EPS from continuing operations, net of taxes to the corresponding non-GAAP financial measures (in thousands, except per share data):

 Items do not sum due to rounding.    

(a) 
 Noncash expenses and income, net in 2016 primarily related to amortization of debt discount on the Convertible Notes (see Note 8) and amortization of customer incentive related to the Amazon Warrant (see Note
6). Noncash expenses and income, net in 2015 primarily related to amortization and accretion of debt, lease and investment discounts.    

(b) 
 Unrealized gain (loss) on financial instruments related to the Amazon Warrant (see Note 6).    

(c) 
 Costs resulting from a change in control under certain benefit plans related to the Amazon transaction (see Note 6).    

(d) 
 Unrealized gain (loss) on financial instruments is excluded from the calculation of Diluted EPS from continuing operations as the calculation assumes exercise of the Amazon Warrant occurred upon its issuance (see Note
13).    

(e) 
 Income tax effect of reconciling items is primarily impacted by nondeductible expenses resulting from a change in control, as defined under certain of the Company s benefit plans, related to the Amazon transaction.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 The most significant liquidity events during the first three quarters of 2016 were as follows:  
  Acquisition Transaction   
 In April 2016, we completed the acquisition of Southern Air for cash consideration of $107.5 million, net of cash acquired, subject to a
working capital adjustment.     Debt Transactions   
 In February 2016, we borrowed $14.8 million related to the conversion of a 767-300BDSF aircraft under the First 2016 Term Loan at a fixed
interest rate of 3.19%.    In June 2016, we borrowed $70.0 million under the Second 2016 Term Loan which has a fixed rate of 3.12%.  
  Operating Activities.  Net cash provided by operating activities for the first three quarters of 2016 was $100.8 million, compared with
$265.8 million for 2015. The decrease primarily reflects changes in the timing of working capital, a payment related to the U.S. class action settlement, the impact of the U.S. West Coast port disruption in 2015 and payments for
Transaction-related expenses in 2016.     Investing Activities.  Net cash used for investing activities was $374.5 million for the
first three quarters of 2016, consisting primarily of $237.1 million of purchase deposits and payments for flight equipment, $107.5 million related to the Southern Acquisition and $36.9 million of core capital expenditures, excluding flight
equipment. Partially offsetting these investing activities were $8.8 million of proceeds from investments. All capital expenditures for the first three quarters of 2016 were funded through working capital, except for the aircraft financed
as discussed above. Net cash used for investing activities was $6.2 million for the first three quarters of 2015, consisting primarily of $76.8 million of proceeds from investments and $25.2 million of proceeds from disposal of
aircraft. Partially offsetting these investing activities was $77.5 million of purchase deposits and payments for flight equipment, and $33.8 million of core capital expenditures, excluding flight equipment. All capital expenditures for the
first three quarters of 2015 were funded through working capital.    Financing Activities.  Net cash used for financing activities was
$51.6 million for the first three quarters of 2016, which primarily reflected $135.8 million of payments on debt obligations, partially offset by $84.8 million of proceeds from debt issuance and $11.2 million of customer maintenance reserves
received. Net cash used for financing activities was $181.5 million for the first three quarters of 2015, which primarily reflected the proceeds from debt issuance of $224.5 million, $36.3 million from the sale of warrants and $12.3 million of
customer maintenance reserves received partially offset by $334.5 million of payments on debt obligations, $52.9 million for the purchase of convertible note hedges, $34.0 million for the payment of debt extinguishment costs, $26.4 million related
to the purchase of treasury stock and $6.8 million of debt issuance costs.    We consider Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments,
Restricted cash and Net cash provided by operating activities to be sufficient to meet our debt and lease obligations, to fund capital expenditures for 2016, and to pay amounts due related to the settlement of the U.S. class action
litigation. Core capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016 are expected to range between $15.0 to $20.0 million, which excludes flight equipment and capitalized interest. Our estimated payments remaining for flight equipment purchase
commitments range between $160.0 to $180.0 million, of which $30.0 to $40.0 million are expected to be made during the remainder of 2016. Total consideration paid in April 2016 for the acquisition of Southern Air was $107.5 million, net of cash
acquired, and is subject to a working capital adjustment.   We may access external sources of capital from time to time depending on our
cash requirements, assessments of current and anticipated market conditions, and the after-tax cost of capital. To that end, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in May 2015 that enables us to sell a yet to be determined amount
of debt and/or equity securities over the subsequent three years, depending on market conditions, our capital needs and other factors. Our access to capital markets can be adversely impacted by prevailing economic conditions and by financial,
business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Additionally, our borrowing costs are affected by market conditions and may be adversely impacted by a tightening in credit markets.  
 We do not expect to pay any significant U.S. federal income tax until 2025 or later. Our business operations are subject to income tax in
several foreign jurisdictions. We do not expect to pay any significant cash income taxes in foreign jurisdictions for at least several years. We currently do not intend to repatriate cash from certain foreign subsidiaries that is
indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Any repatriation of cash from these subsidiaries or certain changes in U.S. tax laws could result in additional tax expense.

  Forward-Looking Statements     This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this  Report ), as well as other reports, releases and written and oral communications issued or made from time to time by or on behalf of AAWW, contain statements that may constitute  forward-looking
statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements are based on management s beliefs, plans, expectations and assumptions, and on information currently available to
management. Generally, the words  will,   may,   should,   expect,   anticipate,   intend,   plan,   continue,   believe,   seek, 
 project,   estimate  and similar expressions used in this Report that do not relate to historical facts are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  
 The forward-looking statements in this Report are not representations or guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
uncertainties and assumptions. Such risks, uncertainties and assumptions include, but are not limited to, those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31,
2016. Many of such factors are beyond AAWW s control and are difficult to predict. As a result, AAWW s future actions, financial position, results of operations and the market price for shares of AAWW s common stock could
differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Readers are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. AAWW does not intend to publicly update any forward-looking statements that may
be made from time to time by, or on behalf of, AAWW, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

and before the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below), the portion of the Award that will be payable is calculated by dividing the number of days from January 1, 2014 until the date of Termination of Employment by
reason of Disability or death, by the total number of days in the Performance Period, and multiplying that fraction by the Payable Amount. Subject to Section 7, the reduced (prorated) Payable Amount, if any (calculated as provided in

case this award will become fully payable at the end of the Performance Period, or (B) there is a Change in Control Termination before the end of the Performance Period, in which case this award will become fully payable in connection with the
Change in Control Termination. In the case of either (A) or (B), the Company shall pay to the Participant, within ten (10) days following the period specified in (A) or (B), the Payable Amount on the basis of the Deemed CIC
Achievement.    7.2.  Vesting in Connection with Shareholder Approval of Restricted Share Issuance . Solely in the case of the Chief

the total voting power of the stock of the Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or group will not be considered a change in control for purposes of this Section 7);  
 (2) the acquisition by a person or group, during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or
group, of ownership of stock possessing 30% or more of the total voting power of the Company (however, if a person or group is considered to control the Company within the meaning of this sentence (i.e., owns stock of the Company possessing 30% of
the total voting power of the Company), then the acquisition of additional control will not be considered a change in control for purposes of this Section 7);  
 (3) the replacement of a majority of members of the Company s Board of Directors during any 12-month period by directors whose

Designation . If no such Beneficiary designation is in effect at the time of a Participant s death, or if no designated Beneficiary survives the Participant, or if such designation conflicts with law, the Participant s estate shall be
deemed to have been designated as the Participant s Beneficiary and shall receive the payment of the amount, if any, payable under the Program upon the Participant s death. If Atlas is in doubt as to the right of any person to receive such
amount, Atlas may retain such amount, without liability for any interest thereon, until the rights thereto are determined, or Atlas may pay such amount into any court of appropriate jurisdiction and such payment shall be a complete discharge of the
liability of the Program and Atlas therefor.

the Program, and no action taken pursuant to the Program, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind. A Participant s right to receive an Award shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of Atlas. All

benefits that are not subject to the requirements of Section 409A. For purposes of this Program, all references to  termination of employment  and correlative phrases shall be construed to require a  separation from service 
(as defined in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury regulations after giving effect to the presumptions contained therein), and the term  specified employee  means an individual determined by the Atlas to be a specified employee under
Treasury regulation Section 1.409A-1(i). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Program, neither the Company, nor any affiliate, nor the Committee, nor any person acting on behalf of the Company, any affiliate, or the Committee, shall
be liable to any Participant or to the estate or beneficiary of any Participant or to any other holder of an Award by reason of any acceleration of income, or any additional tax, asserted by reason of the failure of an Award to be exempt from the
requirements of Section 409A or by reason of Section 4999 of the Code; provided, that nothing in this Section 9.2 shall limit the ability of the Committee or the Company to provide by separate express written agreement with a
Participant for a gross-up payment or other payment in connection with any such tax or additional tax.    9.3.  Rights Limited . Nothing

Exhibit 10.2   
  ATLAS AIR WORLDWIDE HOLDINGS, INC.   
  AMENDED AND RESTATED PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AGREEMENT   
 THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AGREEMENT, dated as of July 18, 2016 (the  Agreement ), between Atlas Air Worldwide
Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ), a Delaware corporation, and William J. Flynn (the  Employee ) amends and supersedes the Performance Share Unit Agreement, dated as of February 21, 2014, with respect to the Performance Share
Award (as defined below) granted to the Employee on February 21, 2014.    WHEREAS, the Employee has been granted the following award
under the Company s 2007 Incentive Plan (the  Plan     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual
covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows.    1.  Award of Performance
Share Units . Pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference and subject to the other provisions of this award, the Employee is hereby awarded 27,723 performance share units ( Performance
Share Units ), which constitute the right to receive, without payment, (i) up to 55,446 shares of common stock of the Company upon the Company s satisfaction of certain performance criteria as described in Section 2 below (the
 Unit Delivered Shares ), and (ii) the right to receive, without payment, additional shares of common stock on the same basis as the Unit Delivered Shares, equal in value (determined as hereafter provided) to the dividends, if any,
which would have been paid with respect to the common stock underlying the Unit Delivered Shares had such Unit Delivered Shares been issued to the Employee on the Date of Grant, as defined below (the  Deferred Dividend Shares ), in each
case subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and those set forth herein. For purposes of (ii), the number of Deferred Dividend Shares with respect to any dividend shall be calculated as of the date on which the dividend is paid to holders of
Company common stock. For the avoidance of doubt, no shares of Stock (including Deferred Dividend Shares) shall be payable in respect of the Unit Delivered Shares if the Unit Delivered Shares are forfeited, and no Deferred Dividend Shares shall be
payable in respect of any dividend for which the record date falls on or after the date on which the Employee or other person entitled to the Unit Delivered Shares becomes the record owner of such shares of Stock for dividend record-date purposes.
If the number of shares of Stock (including Deferred Dividend Shares) deliverable with respect to the Performance Share Units includes a fractional share, the value of such fractional share (determined as of the trading day immediately preceding the
delivery date described in Section 2(c) or 2(f) below) shall be payable in cash in lieu of such fractional share. Except as otherwise expressly provided, all terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan.  
 The Unit Delivered Shares and the Deferred Dividend Shares are collectively referred to herein as the  Performance Share Award  or
 this award.  The Performance Share Award is granted on February 21, 2014 (the  Date of Grant ).  

2.  Vesting; Delivery of Stock; Termination of Employment .  
 (a)  Vesting Generally . Subject to the following provisions of this Section 2 and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Performance Share Award shall become vested (meaning that the Employee shall be entitled to receive a certain number of shares of the Company s common stock (or other consideration to the extent provided in Section 2(f) below)) in
respect of each Performance Share Unit as determined pursuant to Section 2(b)) if, and only if: (x) the Employee remains continuously employed by the Company or its subsidiaries from the date hereof until the end of the Performance Period,
as defined below, (y) there is a Termination of Employment of the Employee pursuant to Section 2(d) or 2(e), as further provided in such Sections, or (z) the conditions of Section 2(f) are satisfied on or before the last day of
the Performance Period.    (b)  Determination of Number of Unit Delivered Shares Upon Satisfaction of Performance Criteria .
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to Section 2(f) below, shares of the Company s common stock underlying the Performance Share Award will only become deliverable by the Company in respect of vested
Performance Share Award and only upon satisfaction of the achievement of certain internal ROIC and EBITDA Growth levels as described below (the  Performance Criteria ) during the period beginning January 1, 2014 and ending
December 31, 2016 (the  Performance Period ). The number of Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares in respect of each vested Performance Share Unit, if any, shall be determined in accordance with Annex A hereto (the
 Performance Unit Plan Schedule ). Performance Share Units are originally awarded on the basis of one Performance Share Unit to one Unit Delivered Share, subject to adjustment depending on the level of achievement set forth in the
Performance Unit Plan Schedule. Intermediate values between specified levels of ROIC and EBITDA are determined by straight line interpolation.  
 (1)  ROIC  for the Company shall be an average of the Company s actual ROIC for 2014, 2015 and 2016 and shall mean a fraction
where the numerator is NOPAT and the denominator is Average Invested Capital, in each case calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).  NOPAT  is defined as operating income
minus Cash Tax Paid.  Cash Tax Paid  is defined as income taxes as reflected on the income statement minus deferred taxes as reflected on the cash flow statement.  Average Invested Capital  is defined as the average of the
beginning and ending Invested Capital during the year.  Invested Capital  is defined as capital lease obligations, plus short and long term debt plus total stockholders  equity minus an amount equal to cash and cash equivalents.
Invested Capital shall exclude investment amounts associated with aircraft acquisition until the first time that such aircraft is flown under a customer contract at which time all amounts accrued with respect to such aircraft shall be considered in
the Average Invested Capital calculation from such date. Invested Capital shall be reduced by the amount of any investments held in the Company s direct or indirect debt securities that remain outstanding and that have not otherwise been
defeased.    (2)  EBITDA  for the Company shall mean income from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation
expense and amortization expense. EBITDA Growth shall be calculated by averaging the percentage increase or decrease in EBITDA for each of the three years ended December 31 in the Performance Period. EBITDA increase or decrease for each twelve
month period shall be calculated by subtracting EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31 for the prior year from EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31 for the current year and dividing the resulting difference in EBITDA by
the EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31 for the prior year.  

(3) The calculations for ROIC and EBITDA shall be adjusted for the following non-recurring items
to the extent reflected on the Company s financial statements: (i) any loss or gain resulting from the early extinguishment of debt, (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles, (iii) asset impairment charges
or (iv) extraordinary items under GAAP. These adjustments shall be made on an  After-tax basis  with respect to ROIC and on a pre-tax basis with respect to EBITDA.  After-tax basis  shall mean the product of the amount of
each non-recurring item times the difference between one and the cash tax rate as published in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable, for the respective fiscal year or 12 month measurement
period. The ROIC ratio will exclude the unconsolidated results of Polar Air Cargo Worldwide.    (c)  Delivery of Unit Delivered
Shares . In connection with the completion of performance, the Committee shall certify, in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the  Code ), whether and at what level
the Performance Criteria have been achieved. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term  Determination Date  means the date on which the Committee makes such certification. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and satisfaction of any
withholding tax liability pursuant to Section 5 hereof, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Determination Date, but in any event no later than March 15, 2017, the Company shall deliver to the Employee a certificate or
certificates or shall credit the Employee s account so as to evidence the number of Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares, if any, to which the Employee is entitled hereunder, as calculated in accordance with Section 2(b)
above.    (d)  Death or Disability . In the event of death or a termination by the Company of the Employee s Employment (a
 Termination of Employment ) by reason of the Employee s Disability occurring after the date hereof, but before the end of the Performance Period and before the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below), the
portion of the Performance Share Award that will vest is calculated by dividing the number of days from January 1, 2014 until the date of Disability or death, by the total number of days in the Performance Period, multiplied by the number of
Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares in respect of each Performance Share Unit, if any, earned on the basis of actual achievement level of the Performance Criteria in the Performance Unit Plan Schedule. Any former Employee, upon
Disability, or the estate of an Employee, upon death, will continue to hold the vested portion of the Performance Share Award, subject to the restrictions and all terms and conditions of this Agreement, until delivery of Shares pursuant to
Section 2(c).    Subject to Section 2(f), the appropriate number of Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares, if any
(calculated as provided in Section 2(b)) shall not be delivered until the completion of the Performance Period and the Determination Date. For purposes of this Agreement, a Termination of Employment shall be deemed to be by reason of
 Disability  if upon such Termination of Employment, the Employee shall have been continuously disabled from performing the duties assigned to Employee for a period of not less than six consecutive calendar months and such Disability shall
be deemed to have commenced on the date following the end of such six consecutive calendar months.  

(e)  Termination by the Company Not For Cause . In the event of Termination of Employment
of the Employee by reason of an involuntary termination by the Company and its subsidiaries not for Cause occurring after the date hereof, but before the end of the Performance Period and before the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company

substitute award granted) pursuant to Section 7(a)(1) of the Plan, the Performance Criteria in the Performance Criteria Schedule of this award, if this award is then outstanding, shall be deemed to have been satisfied based on assumed
achievement at the 200% achievement level ( Deemed CIC Achievement ) and this award shall be deemed fully vested on such basis and the Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares underlying this award shall be delivered or paid to
the Employee within ten (10) days following the Change in Control of the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence but Subject to Section 2(f)(2) below, if in connection with the Change in Control of the Company, this

disposed of in any other manner, in whole or in part.  

4.  Expenses of Issuance of Shares . The issuance of stock certificates hereunder shall be

the end of the payment period prescribed in Sections 2(c) or 2(f), as applicable. In the event the Employee fails to timely pay or timely elect withholding of taxes in the manner described in Section 5(a), (b), (c) or (d), the Company reserves
the right to withhold cash or a number of vested shares of Stock having a then fair market value sufficient to discharge minimum required federal, state and local tax withholding (but no greater than such amount).

Exhibit 10.3   
  ATLAS AIR WORLDWIDE HOLDINGS, INC.   
  AMENDED AND RESTATED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT   
 THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT, dated as of July 18, 2016 (the  Agreement), between Atlas Air Worldwide
Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ), a Delaware corporation, and William J. Flynn (the  Employee ) amends and supersedes the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement between the Company and the Employee, dated as of February 21, 2014,
with respect to the Award (as defined below) granted to the Employee on February 21, 2014.    WHEREAS, the Employee has been granted
the following award under the Company s 2007 Incentive Plan (as amended) (the  Plan ).    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the premises and mutual covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows.    1.
 Award of Restricted Stock Units . Pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference and subject to the other provisions of this award, the Employee is hereby awarded 55,466 restricted stock units
( Restricted Stock Units ), which constitute the right to receive, without payment, (i) 55,446 shares of common stock of the Company (the  Unit Delivered Shares ), and (ii) the right to receive, without payment,
additional shares of common stock on the same basis as the Unit Delivered Shares, equal in value (determined as hereafter provided) to the dividends, if any, which would have been paid with respect to the common stock underlying the Unit Delivered
Shares had such Unit Delivered Shares been issued to the Employee on the Date of Grant, as defined below (the  Deferred Dividend Shares ), in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and those set forth herein. For
purposes of (ii), the number of Deferred Dividend Shares with respect to any dividend shall be calculated as of the date on which the dividend is paid to holders of Company common stock. For the avoidance of doubt, no shares of Stock (including
Deferred Dividend Shares) shall be payable in respect of the Unit Delivered Shares if the Unit Delivered Shares are forfeited, and no Deferred Dividend Shares shall be payable in respect of any dividend for which the record date falls on or after
the date on which the Employee or other person entitled to the Unit Delivered Shares becomes the record owner of such shares of Stock for dividend record-date purposes. If the number of shares of Stock (including Deferred Dividend Shares)
deliverable with respect to the Restricted Stock Units includes a fractional share, the value of such fractional share (determined as of the trading day immediately preceding the delivery date described in Section 2(d) below) shall be payable
in cash in lieu of such fractional share. Except as otherwise expressly provided, all terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan.  
 The Unit Delivered Shares and the Deferred Dividend Shares are collectively referred to herein as the  Award  or  this
award.  The Award is granted as of February 21, 2014 (the  Date of Grant ).  
      1

      2  

Control of the Company, this award is assumed (or a substitute award granted) pursuant to Section 7(a)(1) of the Plan, this award shall continue to vest pursuant to its terms and there shall
be delivered or paid to the Employee, within ten (10) days following vesting, the Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares underlying this award, except that upon a Change in Control Termination before the occurrence of the last

considered to own more than 50% of the total fair market value or 30% of the total voting power of the stock of the Company,     
      3  

the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or group will not be considered a change in control for purposes of this Section 2(c)); (2) the acquisition by a person or group,
during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or group, of ownership of stock possessing 30% or more of the total voting power of the Company (however, if a person or group is considered to control the

Section 2(c)); (3) the replacement of a majority of members of the Company s Board of Directors during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Company s

described above, following which the Company shall have 30 days from the receipt of the notice of termination to cure the event specified in the notice of termination and, if the Company fails to so cure the event, the Employee must terminate his or
her Employment not later than 30 days following the end of such cure period.

Company. To this end, the Employee shall either:      

(a) 
 pay the Company the amount of tax to be withheld (including through payroll withholding if the Company determines that such payment method is acceptable),    

(b)

of Stock having a fair market value sufficient to discharge minimum required federal, state and local withholding (but no greater than such amount).

Section 3. Administration .  
 The Program shall be administered by the Committee in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Section 3 of the Plan.  
  Section 4. Participation .    Each
individual who is employed as an Eligible Participant on the first day of the Performance Period shall participate in the Program. An individual who first becomes employed as an Eligible Participant on or prior to September 30, 2015 (March 31,
2015 in the case of an individual whose Award is intended to qualify for the performance-based compensation exception to the limitations on tax deductibility imposed by Section 162(m) of the Code), may participate in the Program in the
discretion of the Committee (or, in the case of officers below the level of Senior Vice President, its delegate). An individual employed by Atlas, including an Eligible Participant, may be awarded incentive compensation outside the Program in lieu
of or in addition to awards, if any, under the Program.     Section 5. Determination of Awards .  
 5.1.  Target Bonus Award . The target cash bonus payable under an Award for the Performance Period will be the amount established by the
Committee (or, in the case of offices below the level of Senior Vice President, its delegate), for each Participant classification (the  Target Bonus Amount ).  
 5.2.  Performance Measures . Payment of a cash bonus Award is conditioned upon written certification by the Committee of satisfaction of
the achievement of certain internal ROIC and EBITDA Growth levels as described below (the  Performance Criteria ) during the period beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2017 (the  Performance Period ). The
actual cash bonus Award amount (the  Payable Amount ) shall be determined in accordance with Annex A hereto (the  Performance Plan Schedule ). In no event shall the Payable Amount exceed, for any Participant, the maximum amount
specified in Section 4(c) of the Plan.    (1)  ROIC  for the Company shall be an average of the Company s actual ROIC
for 2015, 2016 and 2017 and shall mean a fraction where the numerator is NOPAT and the denominator is Average Invested Capital, in each case calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).  NOPAT

(2)  EBITDA  for the Company shall mean income from continuing operations, before
interest, income taxes, depreciation expense and amortization expense. EBITDA Growth shall be calculated by averaging the percentage increase or decrease in EBITDA for each of the three years ended December 31 in the Performance Period. EBITDA
increase or decrease for each twelve month period shall be calculated by subtracting EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31 for the prior year from EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31 for the current year and dividing
the resulting difference in EBITDA by the EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31 for the prior year.    (3) The calculations
for ROIC and EBITDA shall be adjusted for the following non-recurring items to the extent reflected on the Company s financial statements: (i) any loss or gain resulting from the early extinguishment of debt, (ii) the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principles, (iii) asset impairment charges and (iv) extraordinary items under GAAP. These adjustments shall be made on an  After-tax basis  with respect to ROIC and on a pre-tax basis with respect
to EBITDA.  After-tax basis  shall mean the product of the amount of each non-recurring item times the difference between one and the cash tax rate as published in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, as applicable, for the respective fiscal year or 12 month measurement period. The ROIC ratio will exclude the unconsolidated results of Polar Air Cargo Worldwide.  
  Section 6. Payment of Awards under this Program .  
 6.1.  General . A Participant will be entitled to receive payment, if any, under an Award if the Participant is still employed by Atlas on
December 31, 2017, subject to this Section 6 and Section 7 below. A Participant will receive an Award in the manner and at the times set forth in Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and Section 7.  
 6.2.  Time of Payment . In connection with the completion of performance, the Committee shall certify, in accordance with
Section 162(m) of the Code, whether and at what level the Performance Criteria have been achieved. For the purposes of this Program, the term  Determination Date  means the date on which the Committee makes such certification. Any
Payable Amount for an Award for the Performance Period shall be paid by Atlas within two weeks following the Determination Date, but in no event later than March 15, 2018.  
 6.3.  Form of Payment . All Payable Amounts for an Award shall be paid in cash.  
 6.4.  Termination of Employment .  
 (a)  General . Except as provided otherwise in this Section 6.4 or Section 7, a Participant whose Employment
terminates for any reason prior to the last day of the Performance Period shall forfeit such Award.  
      4  

(b)  Death or Termination by Reason of Disability . In the event of the
death or a termination by the Company of the Participant s Employment with Atlas by reason of the Participant s Disability occurring after January 1, 2015, but before the end of the Performance Period and before the occurrence of a
Change in Control of the Company (as defined below), the portion of the Award that will be payable is calculated by dividing the number of days from January 1, 2015 until the date of termination of Employment by reason of Disability or death,
by the total number of days in the Performance Period, and multiplying that fraction by the Payable Amount. Subject to Section 7, the reduced (prorated) Payable Amount, if any (calculated as provided in Section 5.2) shall not be payable
until after the Determination Date. For purposes of this Program, a termination of Employment shall be deemed to be by reason of  Disability  if immediately prior to such termination of Employment, the Participant shall have been
continuously disabled from performing the duties assigned to the Participant for a period of not less than six consecutive calendar months and such Disability shall be deemed to have commenced on the date following the end of such six consecutive
calendar months.    (c)  Termination by the Company Not For Cause . In the event of termination of Employment of the
Participant by reason of an involuntary termination by the Company and its Subsidiaries not for Cause occurring after January 1, 2015, but before the end of the Performance Period and before the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company
(as defined below), the portion of the Award that will be payable, if any, is calculated by dividing the number of days from January 1, 2015 until the date of the termination of Employment by reason of an involuntary termination not for Cause,
by the total number of days in the Performance Period, multiplied by the Payable Amount. Subject to Section 7, the reduced (prorated) Payable Amount, if any (calculated as provided in Section 5.2) shall not be delivered until after the
Determination Date. For purposes of this Program,  Cause  shall mean (i) the Participant s refusal or failure (other than during periods of illness or disability) to perform the Participant s material duties and
responsibilities to the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) the conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere of the Participant in respect of any felony, other than a motor vehicle offense, (iii) the commission of any act which causes
material injury to the reputation, business or business relationships of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries including, without limitation, any breach of written policies of the Company with respect to trading in securities, (iv) any other
act of fraud, including, without limitation, misappropriation, theft or embezzlement, or (v) a violation of any applicable material policy of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, a violation of the laws against
workplace discrimination.  
      5  

(d) R etirement of the Chief Executive Officer . In the event of a
termination of Employment of the Chief Executive Officer by reason of his Retirement before the end of the Performance Period and before the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below), the Payable Amount shall be payable as
if the Chief Executive Officer had been Employed for the entire Performance Period. Subject to Section 7, the Payable Amount, if any (calculated as provided in Section 5.2) shall not be delivered until after the Determination Date. For
purposes of this Program,  Retirement  shall mean a termination of the Chief Executive Officer s Employment with Atlas for any reason other than Cause on or after the Chief Executive Officer s attainment of age sixty
(60) and ten (10) years of service with Atlas; provided, however, that a voluntary resignation from Employment shall not be considered Retirement for purposes of the Program unless (i) the Chief Executive Officer shall have given not
less than six (6) months  advance written notice of such resignation to the Chair of the Board (or such lesser period of notice as may be determined by the Board) and (ii) such advance written notice shall have been given on or after
April 1, 2017.    (e)  Other Terminations of Employment . Except as provided in this Section 6.4, Section 7 or
in the Plan, any termination of Employment of the Participant occurring prior to the end of the Performance Period (including a termination of Employment initiated by the Participant) shall result in the immediate and automatic termination and
forfeiture of the Award.     Section 7. Change in Control; Shareholder Approval of Restricted Share Issuance .  
 7.1.  Vesting; Determination of Payable Amount . Immediately prior to a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below) unless in
connection therewith an Award is assumed (or a substitute award granted) pursuant to Section 7(a)(1) of the Plan, the Performance Criteria in the Performance Plan Schedule applicable to an Award, if an Award is then outstanding, shall be deemed
to have been satisfied based on assumed achievement at the 200% achievement level ( Deemed CIC Achievement ) and the Company shall pay to the Participant in full satisfaction of its obligations with respect thereto cash in an amount equal
to the Payable Amount on the basis of such Deemed CIC Achievement within ten (10) days following the Change in Control of the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence (but, solely in the case of the Chief Executive Officer,
subject to Section 7.2 below and the fourth sentence of this Section 7.1), if in connection with the Change in Control of the Company, an Award is assumed (or a substitute award granted) pursuant to Section 7(a)(1) of the Plan, an
Award shall become payable only if (A) the Participant remains continuously employed by the Company or its subsidiaries until the end of the Performance Period, in which case this Award will become fully payable at the end of the Performance
Period, or (B) there is a Change in Control Termination before the end of the Performance Period, in which case this Award will become fully payable in connection with the Change in Control Termination. In the case of either (A) or (B),
the Company shall pay to the Participant, within ten (10) days following the period specified in (A) or the time specified in (B) as applicable, the Payable Amount on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement. Solely in the case of the
Chief Executive Officer, in the event of a Change in Control of the Company, notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.1 to the contrary, his Award  
      6  

shall become fully payable, and the Company shall pay the Payable Amount, on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement to the Chief Executive Officer within ten (10) days following the later
of the date on which he becomes eligible for Retirement and a Change in Control of the Company, to the extent necessary for such payment to qualify as a  short-term deferral  within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the
Treasury regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, if there is a Change in Control Termination before the end of the Performance Period and before the date on which the Chief Executive Officer becomes eligible for Retirement, then this Award will
become fully payable in connection with the Change in Control Termination and the Company shall pay the Payable Amount, on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement, to the Chief Executive Officer within ten (10) days following such Change in
Control Termination.    7.2.  Vesting in Connection with Shareholder Approval of Restricted Share Issuance . Solely in the case of the
Chief Executive Officer, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Program, the Performance Criteria in the Performance Plan Schedule applicable to an Award, if an Award is then outstanding, shall be deemed to have been satisfied based on the
Deemed CIC Achievement as of immediately prior to, and the Company shall pay to the Participant in full satisfaction of its obligations with respect thereto cash in an amount equal to the Payable Amount on the basis of such Deemed CIC Achievement
within ten (10) days following, the approval by the Company s shareholders of the  Restricted Share Issuance  as described in the Company s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities Exchange
Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, on August 12, 2016.    7.3.  Definitions . For purposes of
this Program, the following definitions shall apply:    (a)  Change in Control Termination  means the termination
of a Participant s Employment following a Change in Control of the Company (I) by the Company and its subsidiaries not for Cause, (II) by the Participant for  Good Reason  (as defined below), or (III) by reason of the

Company  means a  change in control event  (as that term is defined at Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) of the Treasury Regulations) with respect to the Company, which generally will include the following events, subject to such additional
rules and requirements as may be set forth in the Treasury Regulations and related guidance:    (1) a transfer or issuance of stock of the
Company, where stock in the Company remains outstanding after the transaction, and one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as determined under the Treasury Regulations), acquires ownership of stock in the Company that, together with
stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company (however, if a person or group is considered to own more than 50% of the total fair market value or 30% of
the total voting power of the stock of the Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or group will not be considered a change in control for purposes of this Section 7);  
      7  

(2) the acquisition by a person or group, during the 12-month period ending on the date of the
most recent acquisition by such person or group, of ownership of stock possessing 30% or more of the total voting power of the Company (however, if a person or group is considered to control the Company within the meaning of this sentence (i.e.,
owns stock of the Company possessing 30% of the total voting power of the Company), then the acquisition of additional control will not be considered a change in control for purposes of this Section 7);  
 (3) the replacement of a majority of members of the Company s Board of Directors during any 12-month period by directors whose

group, of assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40% of the total gross fair market value of all the assets of the Company, as determined under the Treasury Regulations (however, a transfer of assets
to certain related persons, as provided under the Treasury Regulations, or to an entity that is controlled by the shareholders of the Company immediately after the transfer, will not be considered a change in control for purposes of this
Section 7).    (c)  Good Reason  means (i) a material reduction in a Participant s duties and
responsibilities from those of the Participant s most recent position with the Company, (ii) a reduction of a Participant s aggregate salary, benefits and other compensation (including incentive opportunity) from that which the Participant
was most recently entitled during Employment with the Company other than in connection with a reduction as part of a general reduction applicable to all similarly-situated Participants of the Company, or (iii) a relocation of a Participant to a
position that is located greater than 40 miles from the location of such Participant s most recent principal location of employment with the Company; provided, however, that a Participant will be treated as having resigned for Good Reason only
if he or she provides the Company with a notice of termination within 90 days of the initial existence of one of the conditions described above, following which the Company shall have 30 days from the receipt of the notice of termination to cure the
event specified in the notice of termination and, if the Company fails to so cure the event, the Participant must terminate his or her Employment not later than 30 days following the end of such cure period.  
  Section 8. Beneficiary Designation .  
 8.1.  Designation and Change of Designation . Each Participant shall file with Atlas a written designation of one or more persons as the
Beneficiary who shall be entitled to receive the Award, if any, payable under the Program upon the Participant s death. A Participant may, from time to time, revoke or change his Beneficiary designation without the consent of any prior
 
      8  

Beneficiary by filing a new designation with Atlas. The last such designation received by Atlas shall be controlling; provided, however, that no designation, or change or revocation thereof,
shall be effective unless received by Atlas prior to the Participant s death, and in no event shall it be effective as of any date prior to such receipt.  
 8.2.  Absence of Valid Designation . If no such Beneficiary designation is in effect at the time of a Participant s death, or if no
designated Beneficiary survives the Participant, or if such designation conflicts with law, the Participant s estate shall be deemed to have been designated as the Participant s Beneficiary and shall receive the payment of the amount, if
any, payable under the Program upon the Participant s death. If Atlas is in doubt as to the right of any person to receive such amount, Atlas may retain such amount, without liability for any interest thereon, until the rights thereto are
determined, or Atlas may pay such amount into any court of appropriate jurisdiction and such payment shall be a complete discharge of the liability of the Program and Atlas therefor.  
  Section 9. General Provisions .    9.1.
 Program to be Unfunded . The Program is intended to constitute an unfunded incentive compensation arrangement. Nothing contained in the Program, and no action taken pursuant to the Program, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any
kind. A Participant s right to receive an Award shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of Atlas. All Awards shall be paid from the general funds of Atlas, and no special or separate fund shall be established and no
segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such Awards. There shall not vest in any Participant or Beneficiary any right, title, or interest in and to any specific assets of Atlas.  
 9.2.  Section 409A of the Code . Awards under the Program are intended to be exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code and shall be construed and administered accordingly. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Program, if at the time of the Participant s termination of employment, the Participant is a  specified
employee,  as defined below, any and all amounts payable under this Program on account of such separation from service that constitute deferred compensation and would (but for this provision) be payable within six (6) months following the
date of termination, shall instead be paid on the next business day following the expiration of such six (6) month period or, if earlier, upon the Participant s death; except (A) to the extent of amounts that do not constitute a
deferral of compensation within the meaning of Treasury regulation Section 1.409A-1(b), as determined by Atlas in its reasonable good faith discretion or (B) other amounts or benefits that are not subject to the requirements of
Section 409A. For purposes of this Program, all references to  termination of employment  and correlative phrases shall be construed to require a  separation from service  (as defined in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the
Treasury regulations after giving effect to the presumptions contained therein), and the term  specified employee  means an individual determined by the Atlas to be a specified employee under Treasury regulation Section 1.409A-1(i).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Program, neither the Company, nor any affiliate, nor the Committee, nor any person acting on behalf of the Company, any affiliate, or the Committee, shall be liable to any Participant or to the estate
or beneficiary of any Participant or to any other holder of an Award by reason of any acceleration of income, or any additional  
      9  

tax, asserted by reason of the failure of an Award to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A or by reason of Section 4999 of the Code; provided, that nothing in this
Section 9.2 shall limit the ability of the Committee or the Company to provide by separate express written agreement with a Participant for a gross-up payment or other payment in connection with any such tax or additional tax.  
 9.3.  Rights Limited . Nothing contained in the Program shall give any Eligible Participant the right to continue in the employment of
Atlas, or limit the right of Atlas to discharge an Eligible Participant.    9.4.  Governing Law . The Program shall be construed and
governed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.    9.5.  Taxes . There shall be deducted from all amounts paid under the
Program all federal, state, local and other taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payments.     Section 10. Amendment,
Suspension, or Termination .    The Committee reserves the right to amend, suspend, or terminate the Program at any time.

as defined below, (y) there is a termination of Employment of the Employee pursuant to Section 2(d) or 2(e), as further provided in such Sections, or (z) the conditions of Section 2(f) are satisfied on or before the last day of
the Performance Period.    (b)  Determination of Number of Unit Delivered Shares Upon Satisfaction of Performance Criteria .
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to Section 2(f) below, shares of the Company s common stock underlying the Performance Share Award will only become deliverable by the Company in respect of vested
Performance Share Award and only upon satisfaction of the achievement of certain internal ROIC and EBITDA Growth levels as described below (the  Performance Criteria ) during the period beginning January 1, 2015 and ending
December 31, 2017 (the  Performance Period ). The number of Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares in respect of each vested Performance Share Unit, if any, shall be determined in accordance with Annex A hereto (the
 Performance Unit Plan Schedule ). Performance Share Units are originally awarded on the basis of one Performance Share Unit to one Unit Delivered Share, subject to adjustment depending on the level of achievement set forth in the
Performance Unit Plan Schedule. Intermediate values between specified levels of ROIC and EBITDA are determined by straight line interpolation.  
 (1)  ROIC  for the Company shall be an average of the Company s actual ROIC for 2015, 2016 and 2017 and shall mean a fraction
where the numerator is NOPAT and the denominator is Average Invested Capital, in each case calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).  NOPAT  is defined as operating income
minus Cash Tax Paid.  Cash Tax Paid  is defined as income taxes as reflected on the income statement minus deferred taxes as reflected on the cash flow statement.  Average Invested Capital  is defined as the average of the
beginning and ending Invested Capital during the year.  Invested Capital  is defined as capital lease obligations, plus short and long term debt plus total stockholders  equity minus an amount equal to cash and cash equivalents.
Invested Capital shall exclude investment amounts associated with aircraft acquisition until the first time that such aircraft is flown under a customer contract at which time all amounts accrued with respect to such aircraft shall be considered in
the Average Invested Capital calculation from such date. Invested Capital shall be reduced by the amount of any investments held in the Company s direct or indirect debt securities that remain outstanding and that have not otherwise been
defeased.    (2)  EBITDA  for the Company shall mean income from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation
expense and amortization expense. EBITDA Growth shall be calculated by averaging the percentage increase or decrease in EBITDA for each of the three years ended December 31 in the Performance Period. EBITDA increase or decrease for each twelve
month period shall be calculated by subtracting EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31 for the prior year from EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31 for the current year and dividing the resulting difference in EBITDA by
the EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31 for the prior year.  
      2  

(3) The calculations for ROIC and EBITDA shall be adjusted for the following non-recurring items
to the extent reflected on the Company s financial statements: (i) any loss or gain resulting from the early extinguishment of debt, (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles, (iii) asset impairment charges
or (iv) extraordinary items under GAAP. These adjustments shall be made on an  After-tax basis  with respect to ROIC and on a pre-tax basis with respect to EBITDA.  After-tax basis  shall mean the product of the amount of
each non-recurring item times the difference between one and the cash tax rate as published in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable, for the respective fiscal year or 12 month measurement
period. The ROIC ratio will exclude the unconsolidated results of Polar Air Cargo Worldwide.    (c)  Delivery of Unit Delivered
Shares . In connection with the completion of performance, the Committee shall certify, in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the  Code ), whether and at what level
the Performance Criteria have been achieved. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term  Determination Date  means the date on which the Committee makes such certification. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and satisfaction of any
withholding tax liability pursuant to Section 5 hereof, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Determination Date, but in any event no later than March 15, 2018, the Company shall deliver to the Employee a certificate or
certificates or shall credit the Employee s account so as to evidence the number of Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares, if any, to which the Employee is entitled hereunder, as calculated in accordance with Section 2(b)
above.    (d)  Death, Disability, or Retirement .  
 (1) In the event of death or a termination by the Company of the Employee s Employment by reason of the Employee s Disability
occurring after the date hereof, but before the end of the Performance Period and before the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below), the portion of the Performance Share Award that will vest is calculated by dividing the
number of days from January 1, 2015 until the date of Disability or death, by the total number of days in the Performance Period, multiplied by the number of Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares in respect of each Performance
Share Unit, if any, earned on the basis of actual achievement level of the Performance Criteria in the Performance Unit Plan Schedule.  
 (2) In the event of a termination of Employment by reason of the Employee s Retirement before the end of the Performance Period and
before the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below), the Performance Share Award will vest in full, in respect of each Performance Share Unit, if any, earned on the basis of actual achievement level of the Performance
Criteria in the Performance Plan Schedule.  
      3  

(3) Any former Employee, upon Disability or Retirement, or the estate of an Employee, upon
death, will continue to hold the vested portion of the Performance Share Award, subject to the restrictions and all terms and conditions of this Agreement, until delivery of Shares pursuant to Section 2(c). Subject to Section 2(f), the
appropriate number of Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares, if any (calculated as provided in Section 2(b)) shall not be delivered until the completion of the Performance Period and the Determination Date. For purposes of this
Agreement, a termination of Employment shall be deemed to be by reason of  Disability  if immediately prior to such termination of Employment, the Employee shall have been continuously disabled from performing the duties assigned to
Employee for a period of not less than six consecutive calendar months and such Disability shall be deemed to have commenced on the date following the end of such six consecutive calendar months. For purposes of this Agreement,
 Retirement  shall mean a termination of the Employee s Employment with the Company for any reason other than Cause on or after the Employee s attainment of age sixty (60) and ten (10) years of service with the Company;
provided, however, that a voluntary resignation from Employment shall not be considered Retirement for purposes of this Agreement unless (i) the Employee shall have given not less than six (6) months  advance written notice of such
resignation to the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Company (or such lesser period of notice as may be determined by the Board of Directors) and (ii) such advance written notice shall have been given on or after April 1, 2017.  
 (e)  Termination by the Company Not For Cause . In the event of termination of Employment of the Employee by reason of an involuntary
termination by the Company and its subsidiaries not for Cause occurring after the date hereof, but before the end of the Performance Period and before the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below), the portion of the
Performance Share Award that will vest is calculated by dividing the number of days from January 1, 2015 until the date of the termination of Employment by reason of an involuntary termination not for Cause, by the total number of days in the
Performance Period, multiplied by the number of Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares in respect of each Performance Share Unit, if any, earned on the basis of actual achievement level of the Performance Criteria in the Performance Unit
Plan Schedule. Any former Employee, upon termination of Employment not for Cause under this Section 2(e), will continue to hold the vested portion of the Performance Share Award, subject to the restrictions and all terms and conditions of this
Agreement, until delivery of Shares pursuant to Section 2(c) or 2(f).    Subject to Section 2(f), the appropriate number of Unit
Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares, if any (calculated as provided in Section 2(b)) shall not be delivered until the completion of the Performance Period and the Determination Date. For purposes of this Agreement,  Cause 
shall mean (i) the Employee s refusal or failure (other than during periods of illness or disability) to perform the Employee s material duties and responsibilities to the Company or its subsidiaries, (ii) the conviction or plea
of guilty or nolo contendere of the Employee in respect of any felony, other than a motor vehicle offense, (iii) the commission of any act which causes material injury to the reputation, business or business relationships of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries including, without limitation, any breach of written policies of the Company with respect to trading in securities, (iv) any other act of fraud, including, without limitation, misappropriation, theft or embezzlement, or
(v) a violation of any applicable material policy of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, a violation of the laws against workplace discrimination.  
      4  

(f)  Change in Control; Shareholder Approval of Restricted Share Issuance .  
 (1) Immediately prior to a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below) unless in connection therewith this award is assumed (or a
substitute award granted) pursuant to Section 7(a)(1) of the Plan, the Performance Criteria in the Performance Criteria Schedule of this award, if this award is then outstanding, shall be deemed to have been satisfied based on assumed
achievement at the 200% achievement level ( Deemed CIC Achievement ) and this award shall be deemed fully vested on such basis and the Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares underlying this award shall be delivered or paid to
the Employee within ten (10) days following the Change in Control of the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, but subject to Section 2(f)(2) below and the fourth sentence of this Section 2(f)(1), if in
connection with the Change in Control of the Company, this award is assumed (or a substitute award granted) pursuant to Section 7(a)(1) of the Plan, this award shall become vested only if (A) the Employee remains continuously employed by
the Company or its subsidiaries until the end of the Performance Period, in which case this award will become fully vested at the end of the Performance Period, or (B) there is a Change in Control Termination before the end of the Performance
Period, in which case this award will become fully vested in connection with the Change in Control Termination. In the case of either (A) or (B), there shall be delivered or paid to the Employee, within ten (10) days following vesting, the
Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares underlying this award, determined on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement. In the event of a Change in Control of the Company, notwithstanding anything in this Section 2(f)(1) to the
contrary, if the Employee is or will become eligible for Retirement prior to the last day of the Performance Period, then this award shall become fully vested on, and the Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares underlying this award,
determined on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement, shall be delivered or paid to the Employee within ten (10) days following the later of the date on which the Employee becomes eligible for Retirement and a Change in Control of the Company,
to the extent necessary for such payment to qualify as a  short-term deferral  within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, if there is a Change in Control Termination before
the end of the Performance Period and before the date on which the Employee becomes eligible for Retirement, then this award will become fully vested in connection with the Change in Control Termination and the Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred
Dividend Shares underlying this award, determined on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement, shall be delivered or paid to the Employee within ten (10) days following such Change in Control Termination.  
 (2) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this award shall become fully vested on, and the Unit Delivered Shares and
Deferred Dividend Shares underlying this award, determined on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement, shall be delivered or paid to the Employee within ten (10) days following, the approval by the Company s shareholders of the
 Restricted Share Issuance  as described in the Company s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, on August 12, 2016.

market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company (however, if a person or group is considered to own more than 50% of the total fair market value or 30% of the total voting power of the stock of the Company, the acquisition of
additional stock by the same person or group will not be considered a change in control for purposes of this Section 2(f));    (2) the
acquisition by a person or group, during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or group, of ownership of stock possessing 30% or more of the total voting power of the Company (however, if a person or
group is considered to control the Company within the meaning of this sentence (i.e., owns stock of the Company possessing 30% of the total voting power of the Company), then the acquisition of additional control will not be considered a change in
control for purposes of this Section 2(f));    (3) the replacement of a majority of members of the Company s Board of Directors
during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Company s Board of Directors before the appointment or election; or

group, of assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40% of the total gross fair market value of all the assets of the Company, as determined under the Treasury Regulations (however, a transfer of assets
to certain related persons, as provided under the Treasury Regulations, or to an entity that is controlled by the shareholders of the Company immediately after the transfer, will not be considered a change in control for purposes of this
Section 2(f)).  
      6  

c.  Good Reason  means (i) a material reduction in the Employee s duties and
responsibilities from those of the Employee s most recent position with the Company, (ii) a reduction of the Employee s aggregate salary, benefits and other compensation (including any incentive opportunity) from that which the
Employee was most recently entitled during Employment other than in connection with a reduction as part of a general reduction applicable to all similarly-situated employees of the Company, or (iii) a relocation of the Employee to a position
that is located greater than 40 miles from the location of such Employee s most recent principal location of employment with the Company; provided, however, that the Employee will be treated as having resigned for Good Reason only if he or she

of the Company, applicable federal and state securities laws or any other applicable laws or regulations and the terms and conditions hereof. This award itself shall not be sold, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, encumbered, or transferred or
disposed of in any other manner, in whole or in part.    4.  Expense  s of Issuance of Shares . The issuance of stock certificates
hereunder shall be without charge to the Employee. The Company shall pay, and indemnify the Employee from and against any issuance, stamp or documentary taxes (other than transfer taxes) or charges imposed by any governmental body, agency or

Withholding . No shares or cash will be issued or paid under this award unless the Employee pays (or makes provision acceptable to the Company for the prompt payment of) an amount sufficient to allow the Company to satisfy its tax withholding
obligations, as determined by the Company. To this end, the Employee shall either:      

(a) 
 pay the Company the amount of tax to be withheld (including through payroll withholding if the Company determines that such a payment method is acceptable),    
      7  

(b) 
 deliver to the Company other shares of Stock owned by the Employee prior to such date having a fair market value, as determined by the Committee, not less than the amount of the withholding tax due, which either have

tax withholding (but no greater than such amount).      In no event shall the payment or withholding of taxes be made later than
the end of the payment period prescribed in Sections 2(c) or 2(f), as applicable. In the event the Employee fails to timely pay or timely elect withholding of taxes in the manner described in Section 5(a), (b), (c) or (d), the Company reserves
the right to withhold cash or a number of vested shares of Stock having a then fair market value sufficient to discharge minimum required federal, state and local tax withholding (but no greater than such amount).

8.  Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws of any jurisdiction which would cause the application of law, other than the State of New York, to be applied.  
 9.  Rights of a Stockholder . The Employee shall have no right to transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber such Unit Delivered
Shares or Deferred Dividend Shares. Once the Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares vest and the shares of Stock underlying those units or shares have been delivered, but not until such time and only with respect to the shares of Stock
so delivered, the Employee shall have the rights of a stockholder, including, but not limited to, the right to vote and to receive dividends.  
 10.  No Right to Continued Employment . This Performance Share Award shall not confer upon the Employee any right with respect to
continuance of employment by the Company nor shall this Performance Share Award interfere with the right of the Company to terminate the Employee s employment at any time.

and the awards and grants set forth herein shall be subject to and shall be governed by the terms set forth in the Plan, a copy of which has been furnished to the Employee and which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement. In the event of

this Agreement, if at the time of the Employee s termination of Employment, the Employee is a  specified employee,  as defined below, any and all amounts payable under this Agreement on account of such separation from service that
constitute deferred compensation and would (but for this provision) be payable within six (6) months following the date of termination, shall instead be paid on the next business day following the expiration of such six (6) month period
or, if earlier, upon the Participant s death; except (A) to the extent of amounts that do not constitute a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Treasury regulation Section 1.409A-1(b), as determined by the Company in its
reasonable good faith discretion or (B) other amounts or benefits that are not subject to the requirements of Section 409A. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to  termination of employment  and correlative phrases
shall be construed to require a  separation from service  (as defined in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury regulations after giving effect to the presumptions contained therein), and the term  specified employee  means an
individual determined by the Company to be a specified employee under Treasury regulation Section 1.409A-1(i). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Company, nor any subsidiary, nor the Committee, nor any person
acting on behalf of the Company, any subsidiary, or the Committee, shall be liable to the Employee or to the estate or beneficiary of the Employee by reason of any acceleration of income, or any additional tax, asserted by reason of the failure of
this Agreement or any payment hereunder to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.    [SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS AS A

  ATLAS AIR WORLDWIDE HOLDINGS, INC.   
  AMENDED AND RESTATED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT   
 THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT, dated as of July 18, 2016 (the  Agreement), between Atlas Air Worldwide
Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ), a Delaware corporation, and William J. Flynn (the  Employee ) amends and supersedes the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement between the Company and the Employee, dated as of February 24, 2015,
with respect to the Award (as defined below) granted to the Employee on February 24, 2015.    WHEREAS, the Employee has been granted
the following award under the Company s 2007 Incentive Plan (as amended) (the  Plan ).    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the premises and mutual covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows.    1.
 Award of Restricted Stock Units . Pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference and subject to the other provisions of this award, the Employee is hereby awarded 41,290 restricted stock units
( Restricted Stock Units ), which constitute the right to receive, without payment, (i) 41,290 shares of common stock of the Company (the  Unit Delivered Shares ), and (ii) the right to receive, without payment,
additional shares of common stock on the same basis as the Unit Delivered Shares, equal in value (determined as hereafter provided) to the dividends, if any, which would have been paid with respect to the common stock underlying the Unit Delivered
Shares had such Unit Delivered Shares been issued to the Employee on the Date of Grant, as defined below (the  Deferred Dividend Shares ), in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and those set forth herein. For
purposes of (ii), the number of Deferred Dividend Shares with respect to any dividend shall be calculated as of the date on which the dividend is paid to holders of Company common stock. For the avoidance of doubt, no shares of Stock (including
Deferred Dividend Shares) shall be payable in respect of the Unit Delivered Shares if the Unit Delivered Shares are forfeited, and no Deferred Dividend Shares shall be payable in respect of any dividend for which the record date falls on or after
the date on which the Employee or other person entitled to the Unit Delivered Shares becomes the record owner of such shares of Stock for dividend record-date purposes. If the number of shares of Stock (including Deferred Dividend Shares)
deliverable with respect to the Restricted Stock Units includes a fractional share, the value of such fractional share (determined as of the trading day immediately preceding the delivery date described in Section 2(d) below) shall be payable
in cash in lieu of such fractional share. Except as otherwise expressly provided, all terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan.  
 The Unit Delivered Shares and the Deferred Dividend Shares are collectively referred to herein as the  Award  or  this
award.  The Award is granted as of February 24, 2015 (the  Date of Grant ).

      2  

Control of the Company, this award is assumed (or a substitute award granted) pursuant to Section 7(a)(1) of the Plan, this award shall continue to vest pursuant to its terms and there shall
be delivered or paid to the Employee, within ten (10) days following vesting, the Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares underlying this award, except that upon a Change in Control Termination before the occurrence of the last

pre-tax income for the respective fiscal year or 12-month measurement period. The ROIC ratio will exclude the unconsolidated results of Polar Air Cargo Worldwide, Inc.

 (e)  Other Terminations of Employment . Except as provided in this Section 6.4 or in Section 7, any termination

  Section 7. Change in Control .    7.1.
 Vesting; Determination of Payable Amount . Immediately prior to a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below) unless in connection therewith an Award is assumed (or a substitute award granted) pursuant to Section 7(a)(1) of the
Plan, the Performance Criteria in the Performance Plan Schedule applicable to an Award, if an Award is then outstanding, shall be deemed to have been satisfied based on assumed achievement at the 200% achievement level ( Deemed CIC
Achievement ) and the Company shall pay to the Participant in full satisfaction of its obligations with respect thereto cash in an amount equal to the Payable Amount on the basis of such Deemed CIC Achievement within ten (10) days
following the Change in Control of the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence but subject to the fourth sentence of this Section 7.1 (and, solely in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, Section 7.2 below), if in
connection with the Change in Control of the Company, an Award is assumed (or a substitute award granted) pursuant to Section 7(a)(1) of the Plan, an Award shall become payable only if (A) the Participant remains continuously Employed by
the Company or its subsidiaries until the end of the Performance Period, in which case this Award will become fully payable at the end of the Performance Period, or (B) there is a Change in Control Termination before the end of the Performance
Period, in which case this Award will become fully payable in  
      6  

connection with the Change in Control Termination. In the case of either (A) or (B), the Company shall pay to the Participant, within ten (10) days following the period specified in
(A) or the time specified in (B), as applicable, the Payable Amount on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement. In the event of a Change in Control of the Company, notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.1 to the contrary, if the
Participant is or will become eligible for Retirement prior to the last day of the Performance Period, then this Award shall become fully payable on, and the Company shall pay the Payable Amount, on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement, to the
Participant within ten (10) days following, the later of the date on which the Participant becomes eligible for Retirement and a Change in Control of the Company, to the extent necessary for such payment to qualify as a  short-term
deferral  within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, if a there is a Change in Control Termination before the end of the Performance Period and before the date on which the
Employee becomes eligible for Retirement, then this Award will become fully payable in connection with the Change in Control Termination and the Company shall pay the Payable Amount, on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement, to the Participant
within ten (10) days following such Change in Control Termination.    7.2.  Vesting in Connection with Shareholder Approval of
Restricted Share Issuance . Solely in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Program, the Performance Criteria in the Performance Plan Schedule applicable to an Award, if an Award is then

position that is located greater than 40 miles from the location of such Participant s most recent principal location of employment with the Company; provided, however, that a Participant will be treated as having resigned for Good Reason only
if he or she provides the Company with a notice of termination within 90 days of the initial existence of one of the conditions described above, following which the Company shall have 30 days from the receipt of the notice of termination to cure the

 8.1.  Designation and Change of Designation . Each Participant shall file with Atlas a written designation of one or more persons as the
Beneficiary who shall be entitled to receive the Award, if any, payable under the Program upon the Participant s death. A Participant may, from time to time, revoke or change his Beneficiary designation without the consent of any prior

amount, Atlas may retain such amount, without liability for any interest thereon, until the rights thereto are determined, or Atlas may pay such amount into any court of appropriate jurisdiction and such payment shall be a complete discharge of the
liability of the Program and Atlas therefor.     Section 9. General Provisions .  
 9.1.  Program to be Unfunded . The Program is intended to constitute an unfunded incentive compensation arrangement. Nothing contained in

Awards shall be paid from the general funds of Atlas, and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such Awards. There shall not vest in any Participant or Beneficiary any right,
title, or interest in and to any specific assets of Atlas.    9.2.  Section 409A of the Code . Awards under the Program are
intended to be exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and shall be construed and administered accordingly. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Program, if at the time of the Participant s
termination of employment, the Participant is a  specified employee,  as defined below, any and all amounts payable under this Program on account of such separation from service that constitute deferred compensation and would (but for this
provision) be payable within six (6) months following the date of termination, shall instead be paid on the next business day following the expiration of such six (6) month period or, if earlier, upon the Participant s death; except
(A) to the extent of amounts that do not constitute a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Treasury regulation Section 1.409A-1(b), as determined by Atlas in its reasonable good faith discretion or (B) other amounts or
benefits that are not subject to the requirements of Section 409A. For purposes of this Program, all references to  termination of employment  and correlative phrases shall be construed to require a  separation from service 
(as defined in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury regulations after giving effect to the presumptions contained therein), and the term  specified employee  means an individual determined by the Atlas to be a specified employee under
Treasury regulation Section 1.409A- 
      9  

1(i). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Program, neither the Company, nor any affiliate, nor the Committee, nor any person acting on behalf of the Company, any affiliate, or the
Committee, shall be liable to any Participant or to the estate or beneficiary of any Participant or to any other holder of an Award by reason of any acceleration of income, or any additional tax, asserted by reason of the failure of an Award to be
exempt from the requirements of Section 409A or by reason of Section 4999 of the Code; provided, that nothing in this Section 9.2 shall limit the ability of the Committee or the Company to provide by separate express written agreement
with a Participant for a gross-up payment or other payment in connection with any such tax or additional tax.    9.3.  Rights Limited .
Nothing contained in the Program shall give any Eligible Participant the right to continue in the employment of Atlas, or limit the right of Atlas to discharge an Eligible Participant.  
 9.4.  Governing Law . The Program shall be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.  
 9.5.  Taxes . There shall be deducted from all amounts paid under the Program all federal, state, local and other taxes required by law to
be withheld with respect to such payments.     Section 10. Amendment, Suspension, or Termination .

Exhibit 10.8   
  ATLAS AIR WORLDWIDE HOLDINGS, INC.   
  AMENDED AND RESTATED PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT   
  AGREEMENT     THIS AMENDED
AND RESTATED PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AGREEMENT, dated as of July 18, 2016, 2016 (the  Agreement ), is between Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ), a Delaware corporation, and William J. Flynn (the
 Employee) amends and supersedes the Performance Share Unit Agreement, dated as of February 11, 2016, and the Amended and Restated Performance Share Unit Agreement, dated as of April 29, 2016, each between the Company and the
Employee, with respect to the Performance Share Award (as defined below) granted to the Employee on February 11, 2016.    1.  Award of
Performance Share Units . Pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference and subject to the other provisions of this award, the Employee is hereby awarded 25,535 performance share units
( Performance Share Units ), which constitute the right to receive, without payment, (i) up to 51,070 shares of common stock of the Company upon the Company s satisfaction of certain performance criteria as described in
Section 2 below (the  Unit Delivered Shares ), and (ii) the right to receive, without payment, additional shares of common stock on the same basis as the Unit Delivered Shares, equal in value (determined as hereafter provided) to
the dividends, if any, which would have been paid with respect to the common stock underlying the Unit Delivered Shares had such Unit Delivered Shares been issued to the Employee on the Date of Grant, as defined below (the  Deferred Dividend
Shares ), in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and those set forth herein. For purposes of (ii), the number of Deferred Dividend Shares with respect to any dividend shall be calculated as of the date on which the
dividend is paid to holders of Company common stock. For the avoidance of doubt, no shares of Stock (including Deferred Dividend Shares) shall be payable in respect of the Unit Delivered Shares if the Unit Delivered Shares are forfeited, and no
Deferred Dividend Shares shall be payable in respect of any dividend for which the record date falls on or after the date on which the Employee or other person entitled to the Unit Delivered Shares becomes the record owner of such shares of Stock
for dividend record-date purposes. If the number of shares of Stock (including Deferred Dividend Shares) deliverable with respect to the Performance Share Units includes a fractional share, the value of such fractional share (determined as of the
trading day immediately preceding the delivery date described in Section 2(c) or 2(f) below) shall be payable in cash in lieu of such fractional share. Except as otherwise expressly provided, all terms used herein shall have the same meaning as
in the Plan.    The Unit Delivered Shares and the Deferred Dividend Shares are collectively referred to herein as the  Performance
Share Award  or  this award.  The Performance Share Award is granted on February 11, 2016 (the  Date of Grant ).  
 2.  Vesting; Delivery of Stock; Termination of Employment .  
 (a)  Vesting Generally . Subject to the following provisions of this Section 2 and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Performance Share Award shall become vested (meaning that the Employee shall be entitled to receive a certain number of shares of the Company s common stock (or other consideration to the extent provided in Section

2(f) below)) in respect of each Performance Share Unit as determined pursuant to Section 2(b)) if, and only if: (x) the Employee remains continuously employed by the Company or its
subsidiaries from the date hereof until the end of the Performance Period, as defined below, (y) there is a termination of Employment of the Employee pursuant to Section 2(d) or 2(e), as further provided in such Sections, or (z) the
conditions of Section 2(f) are satisfied on or before the last day of the Performance Period.    (b)  Determination of Number of Unit
Delivered Shares Upon Satisfaction of Performance Criteria . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to Section 2(f) below, shares of the Company s common stock underlying the Performance Share Award will
only become deliverable by the Company in respect of vested Performance Share Award and only upon satisfaction of the achievement of certain internal ROIC and EBITDA Growth levels as described below (the  Performance Criteria ) during the
period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2018 (the  Performance Period ). The number of Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares in respect of each vested Performance Share Unit, if any, shall be determined
in accordance with Annex A hereto (the  Performance Unit Plan Schedule ). Performance Share Units are originally awarded on the basis of one Performance Share Unit to one Unit Delivered Share, subject to adjustment depending on the level
of achievement set forth in the Performance Unit Plan Schedule. Intermediate values between specified levels of ROIC and EBITDA are determined by straight line interpolation.  
 (1)  ROIC  for the Company shall be an average of the Company s actual ROIC for 2016, 2017 and 2018 and shall mean a fraction
where the numerator is NOPAT and the denominator is Average Invested Capital, in each case calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).  NOPAT  is defined as operating income
minus Cash Tax Paid.  Cash Tax Paid  is defined as income taxes as reflected on the income statement minus deferred taxes as reflected on the cash flow statement.  Average Invested Capital  is defined as the average of the
beginning and ending Invested Capital during the year.  Invested Capital  is defined as capital lease obligations, plus short and long term debt plus total stockholders  equity minus an amount equal to cash and cash equivalents.
Invested Capital shall exclude investment amounts associated with aircraft acquisition until the first time that such aircraft is flown under a customer contract at which time all amounts accrued with respect to such aircraft shall be considered in
the Average Invested Capital calculation from such date. Invested Capital shall be reduced by the amount of any investments held in the Company s direct or indirect debt securities that remain outstanding and that have not otherwise been
defeased.    (2)  EBITDA  for the Company shall mean income from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation
expense and amortization expense. EBITDA Growth shall be calculated by averaging the percentage increase or decrease in EBITDA for each of the three years ended December 31 in the Performance Period. EBITDA increase or decrease for each twelve
month period shall be calculated by subtracting EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31 for the prior year from EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31 for the current year and dividing the resulting difference in EBITDA by
the EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31 for the prior year.  

(3) In the calculation of EBITDA Growth and ROIC, amounts objectively demonstrated to be
attributable to the following items will not be taken into account: (i) any gain or loss resulting from changes in accounting principles; (ii) results from discontinued operations as defined by GAAP as well as any costs related to impairments,
restructurings or other discontinued activities; (iii) any impact associated with warrants issued in conjunction with Project Andromeda; (iv) any loss or gain resulting from the early extinguishment or restructuring of any debt or lease
and the write-off of fees, deferred costs or debt discounts on the early extinguishment or restructuring of any debt or lease; (v) any pre-operating costs associated with Project Andromeda (vi) any integration and transition costs
associated with the acquisition of Southern Air and related entities (vi) any loss or gain on the sale of aircraft, engines or other aircraft parts; (vii) any costs related to retention or recruitment or termination of officers (including,
without limitation, sign-on bonuses, off-cycle cash bonuses, off-cycle equity grants, search fees, relocation and related expenses and compensation expense resulting from the accelerated vesting of equity-based awards under retirement or severance
agreements); (viii) any costs related to collective bargaining, other labor negotiations, grievances or other disputes involving labor unions or flight attendants; (ix) any fees of outside advisors (including, without limitation, lawyers,
accountants, bankers and rating agencies), or secondees (collectively,  Fees ) associated with refinancing or restructuring of existing financings, or business acquisitions, dispositions, mergers or combinations, joint ventures, or
corporate finance transactions (including capital markets transactions); (x) Fees incurred after January 1, 2016 associated with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits in the U.S., U.K., Netherlands and elsewhere, as well as payment
of any fines or penalties for such investigations or actions or any countries  antitrust investigations and any settlement of any related matters; and (xi) Fees associated with any Brazilian customs or labor claims or investigations, as
well as payment of any related fines, penalties or deposits. These adjustments shall be made on an  After-tax basis  with respect to ROIC and on a pre-tax basis with respect to EBITDA.  After-tax basis  shall mean the product of
the amount of each non-recurring item times the difference between one and the ratio between allocable Cash Tax Paid for each item and the Company s consolidated worldwide pre-tax income for the respective fiscal year or 12-month measurement
period. The ROIC ratio will exclude the unconsolidated results of Polar Air Cargo Worldwide, Inc.    (c)  Delivery of Unit Delivered
Shares . In connection with the completion of performance, the Committee shall certify, in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the  Code ), whether and at what level
the Performance Criteria have been achieved. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term  Determination Date  means the date in 2019 on which the Committee makes such certification. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and satisfaction
of any withholding tax liability pursuant to Section 5 hereof, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Determination Date, but in any event no later than March 15, 2019, the Company shall deliver to the Employee a certificate or
certificates or shall credit the Employee s account so as to evidence the number of Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares, if any, to which the Employee is entitled hereunder, as calculated in accordance with Section 2(b)
above.  

(d)  Death, Disability or Retirement .  
 (1) In the event of death or a termination by the Company of the Employee s Employment by reason of the Employee s Disability
occurring after the date hereof, but before the end of the Performance Period and before the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below), the portion of the Performance Share Award that will vest is calculated by dividing the
number of days from January 1, 2016 until the date of Disability or death, by the total number of days in the Performance Period, multiplied by the number of Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares in respect of each Performance
Share Unit, if any, earned on the basis of actual achievement level of the Performance Criteria in the Performance Unit Plan Schedule.  
 (2) In the event of a termination of Employment by reason of the Employee s Retirement before the end of the Performance Period and
before the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below), the Performance Share Award will vest in full, in respect of each Performance Share Unit, if any, earned on the basis of actual achievement level of the Performance
Criteria in the Performance Plan Schedule.    (3) Any former Employee, upon Disability or Retirement, or the estate of an Employee, upon
death, will continue to hold the vested portion of the Performance Share Award, subject to the restrictions and all terms and conditions of this Agreement, until delivery of Shares pursuant to Section 2(c). Subject to Section 2(f), the
appropriate number of Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares, if any (calculated as provided in Section 2(b)) shall not be delivered until the completion of the Performance Period and the Determination Date. For purposes of this
Agreement, a termination of Employment shall be deemed to be by reason of  Disability  if immediately prior to such termination of Employment, the Employee shall have been continuously disabled from performing the duties assigned to
Employee for a period of not less than six consecutive calendar months and such Disability shall be deemed to have commenced on the date following the end of such six consecutive calendar months. For purposes of this Agreement,
 Retirement  shall mean the a termination of the Employee s Employment with the Company for any reason other than Cause on or after the Employee s attainment of age sixty (60) and ten (10) years of service with the
Company; provided, however, that a voluntary resignation from Employment shall not be considered Retirement for purposes of this Agreement unless (i) the Employee shall have given not less than six (6) months  advance written notice
of such resignation to the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Company (or such lesser period of notice as may be determined by the Board of Directors) and (ii) such advance written notice shall have been given on or after April 1,
2017.    (e)  Termination by the Company Not For Cause . In the event of termination of Employment of the Employee by reason of an
involuntary termination by the Company and its subsidiaries not for Cause occurring after the date hereof, but before the end of the Performance Period and before the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below), the portion
of the Performance Share Award that will vest is calculated by dividing the number of days from January 1, 2016 until the date of the termination of Employment by reason of an involuntary termination not for Cause, by the total number of days
in the Performance Period, multiplied by the number of Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares in respect of each Performance Share Unit, if any, earned on the basis of actual achievement level of the Performance Criteria in the
Performance Unit Plan Schedule. Any former Employee, upon termination of Employment not for Cause under this Section 2(e), will continue to hold the vested portion of the Performance Share Award, subject to the restrictions and all terms and
conditions of this Agreement, until delivery of Shares pursuant to Section 2(c) or 2(f).  

Subject to Section 2(f), the appropriate number of Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred
Dividend Shares, if any (calculated as provided in Section 2(b) shall not be delivered until the completion of the Performance Period and the Determination Date. For purposes of this Agreement,  Cause  shall mean (i) the
Employee s refusal or failure (other than during periods of illness or disability) to perform the Employee s material duties and responsibilities to the Company or its subsidiaries, (ii) the conviction or plea of guilty or nolo
contendere of the Employee in respect of any felony, other than a motor vehicle offense, (iii) the commission of any act which causes material injury to the reputation, business or business relationships of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries including, without limitation, any breach of written policies of the Company with respect to trading in securities, (iv) any other act of fraud, including, without limitation, misappropriation, theft or embezzlement, or (v) a
violation of any applicable material policy of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, a violation of the laws against workplace discrimination.  
 (f)  Change in Control; Shareholder Approval of Restricted Share Issuance .  
 (1) Immediately prior to a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below) unless in connection therewith this award is assumed (or a
substitute award granted) pursuant to Section 7(a)(1) of the Plan, the Performance Criteria in the Performance Criteria Schedule of this award, if this award is then outstanding, shall be deemed to have been satisfied based on assumed
achievement at the 200% achievement level ( Deemed CIC Achievement ) and this award shall be deemed fully vested on such basis and the Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares underlying this award shall be delivered or paid to
the Employee within ten (10) days following the Change in Control of the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, but subject to Section 2(f)(2) below and the fourth sentence of this Section 2(f)(1), if in
connection with the Change in Control of the Company, this award is assumed (or a substitute award granted) pursuant to Section 7(a)(1) of the Plan, this award shall become vested only if (A) the Employee remains continuously Employed by
the Company or its subsidiaries until the end of the Performance Period, in which case this award will become fully vested at the end of the Performance Period, or (B) there is a Change in Control Termination before the end of the Performance
Period, in which case this award will become fully vested in connection with the Change in Control Termination. In the case of either (A) or (B), there shall be delivered or paid to the Employee, within ten (10) days following vesting, the
Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares underlying this award, determined on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement. In the event of a Change in Control of the Company, notwithstanding anything in this Section 2(f)(1) to the
contrary, if the Employee is or will become eligible for Retirement prior to the last day of the Performance Period, then this award shall become fully vested on, and the Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares underlying this award,
determined on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement, shall be delivered or paid to the Employee within ten (10) days following, the later of the date on which the Employee becomes eligible for Retirement and a Change in Control of the
Company, to the extent necessary for such payment to qualify as a  short-term deferral  within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury regulations. For the avoidance of  

doubt, if a there is a Change in Control Termination before the end of the Performance Period and before the date on which the Employee becomes eligible for Retirement, then this award will
become fully vested in connection with the Change in Control Termination and the Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares underlying this award, determined on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement, shall be delivered or paid to the
Employee within ten (10) days following such Change in Control Termination.    (2) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, this award shall become fully vested on, and the Unit Delivered Shares and Deferred Dividend Shares underlying this award, determined on the basis of the Deemed CIC Achievement, shall be delivered or paid to the Employee within ten
(10) days following, the approval by the Company s shareholders of the  Restricted Share Issuance  as described in the Company s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities Exchange Commission

market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company (however, if a person or group is considered to own more than 50% of the total fair market value or 30% of the total voting power of the stock of the Company, the acquisition of

40 miles from the location of such Employee s most recent principal location of Employment with the Company; provided, however, that the Employee will be treated as having resigned for Good Reason only if he or she provides the Company with a

disposed of in any other manner, in whole or in part.  

4.  Expenses of Issuance of Shares . The issuance of stock certificates hereunder shall be
without charge to the Employee. The Company shall pay, and indemnify the Employee from and against any issuance, stamp or documentary taxes (other than transfer taxes) or charges imposed by any governmental body, agency or official (other than

or, if earlier, upon the Participant s death; except (A) to the extent of amounts that do not constitute a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Treasury regulation Section 1.409A-1(b), as determined by the Company in its
reasonable good faith discretion or (B) other amounts or benefits that are not subject to the requirements of Section 409A. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to  termination of employment  and correlative phrases

this Agreement or any payment hereunder to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.    7.  References . References
herein to rights and obligations of the Employee shall apply, where appropriate, to the Employee s legal representative or estate without regard to whether specific reference to such legal representative or estate is contained in a particular
