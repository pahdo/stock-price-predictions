   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS  

UNICOBE Corp. ( the Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 19, 2014. We are in a business of producing and selling laser engravings on glass billets.  Our office is located at Serdike 17A, ap. 37 Sofia, Bulgaria, 1000.   

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN  

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.  However, the Company had limited revenues   as of September 30  , 2016.  The Company currently has negative working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.  

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis of presentation    

  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company s year-end is June 30.  

Use of Estimates   

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash     and Cash     E    q    ui    v    a    lents   

  T  h  e     C  o  m  p  a  ny     c  o  nsi  d  ers     all     h  i  gh  ly     li  qu  i  d     inves  t  m  e  n  ts     wit  h     t  h  e     ori  g  i  n  a  l     m  atu  ritie  s     o  f     thre  e     m  on  t  hs     or     les  s     to   be ca  s  h   e  q  u  i  v  a  le  n  t  s. The Company had $559 of cash as of September 30, 2016 and $1,963 as of June 30, 2016.  

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

  ASC topic 820 "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.  

These tiers include:  

Level 1:   

Defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;    

Level 2:   

Defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and    

Level 3:   

Defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.    

The carrying value of cash and the Company s loan from shareholder approximates its fair value due to their short-term maturity.

   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

Inventories   

  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally determined using the first in, first out (  FIFO  ) method. The Company had a total of $580 in inventory with no amount in inventory work-in process as of September 30, 2016 and a total of $1,507 in inventory, $177 in inventory work-in process and $1,330 in raw materials as of June 30, 2016.  

Prepaid Expenses   

  Prepaid Expenses are recorded at fair market value. The Company had $450 in prepaid expenses as of   September 30, 2016   and $402 as of June 30, 2016.  

Depreciation, Amortization, and Capitalization    

  The Company records depreciation and amortization when appropriate using both straight-line and declining balance methods over the estimated useful life of the assets. We estimate that the useful life of a   laser-engraving machine is 7 years and current version of web site is 1 year.   Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions, major renewals and replacements that increase the property's useful life are capitalized. Property sold or retired, together with the related accumulated depreciation is removed from the   appropriate accounts and the resultant gain or loss is included in net income.   

Income Taxes   

  Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.  Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.  A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.  

Revenue Recognition   

  The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC topic 605  Revenue Recognition .   The Company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.     Our customers have a right of return of the products for one month from the invoice date.  

Stock-Based Compensation   

  Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718.  To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.  

Basic Income (Loss) Per Share   

  The Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260  Earnings per Share . Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding.  

Comprehensive Income   

  Comprehensive income is defined as all changes in stockholders' equity (deficit), exclusive of transactions with owners, such as capital investments. Comprehensive income includes net income or loss, changes in certain assets and liabilities that are reported directly in equity such as translation adjustments on investments in foreign subsidiaries and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 there were no differences between our comprehensive loss and net loss.

NOTE 7   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

The Company has entered into a one-year rental agreement for a $150 monthly fee, starting on May 1, 2016 ending on May 1, 2017.  

NOTE 8   INCOME TAXES  

The Company adopted the provisions of uncertain tax positions as addressed in ASC 740-10-65-1. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10-65-1, the Company recognized no increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.  

The Company has no tax position at September 30, 2016 for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. The Company does not recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. No such interest or penalties were recognized during the period presented. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at September 30, 2016. The Company s utilization of any net operating loss carry forward may be unlikely as a result of its intended activities.  

The valuation allowance at September 30, 2016 was approximately $6,809. The net change in valuation allowance during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $483. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of September 30, 2016.  All tax years since inception remain open for examination by taxing authorities.  

The Company has a net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes totaling approximately $20,026 at September 30, 2016, expiring through 2036. There is a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by carryforwards after a change in control (generally greater than a 50% change in ownership). Temporary differences, which give rise to a net deferred tax asset, are as follows:

NOTE 9   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

In accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company   has analyzed its operations subsequent to   September 30, 2016   through the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.  

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

This quarterly report and other reports filed by Unicobe Corp.   ( we,   us,   our,  or the  Company ), from time to time contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company s management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the filings, the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   future,   intend,   plan,  or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company s management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.  

Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.  

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates.  

Overview   

Unicobe Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 19, 2014. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets. Our business office is located at Serdike 17A, ap. 37 Sofia, Bulgaria, 1000.  Our telephone number is +17028506585.  

11      

Our business is the application of various types and shapes of laser engravings onto glass billets and distribution thereof primarily in Bulgaria and neighboring countries. We have generated limited revenues from operations to date.  

Our products can be divided into three categories: 1) mass market tourist souvenirs; 2) corporate gifts, souvenirs and insignia; 3) individually designed laser engraved glass products for personal use as an element of interior design or memento. Success of our business plan will depend on the flow of tourists, business climate and economic progress of Bulgaria and the region. A downturn of tourism particularly and of the corporate sector in general can adversely affect our intended business.  

We will distribute our laser engraved glass products in Bulgaria and neighboring countries. We plan to use various distribution channels for various types of customers. We plan to distribute mass-market souvenirs via supermarkets of large retail chains, tourist shops and kiosks; corporate clients and individual clients will be covered by our web page and targeted marketing exercises.  

Product Overview   

Unicobe Corp. s business is in applying standard and custom laser engravings on glass billets of various shapes to be sold to both mass-market consumers and individual clients. Individual customers may use either Unicobe-proposed designs or their own.  

We plan that our production capacities will allow us to manufacture souvenirs, tourist-oriented products, up-market gifts and interior design items from glass based on advanced and unique designs and templates.  

Unicobe Corp. has purchased a 3D Crystal Laser engraving machine from a Chinese vendor. This machine has more modern advanced functions and will serve for expediting the range of offered engraving products and increasing the quality level of engraving items.   

Unicobe Corp. has the ability to manufacture such original items as, for example:  

Advertising or corporate glass souvenirs with brand identity of the customer;  

    High-end souvenir-like glass gifts and awards;  

    Custom designed nameplates.  

However, first, we intend to launch a mass manufacture of inexpensive laser-engraved tourist souvenirs of various shapes.

Tourists coming to spend their vacations to Bulgaria and neighboring countries. First of all, we rely on the tourism potential of Bulgaria. In 2013, 9.2 mln tourists visited Bulgaria. Tourists from Greece, Romania and Turkey comprise 40% of all persons attending the country. Tourism sector in Bulgaria constituted 13.6% of GDP, having provided for 111,856 workplaces in 2013. During three summer months of 2013 the average amount of tourists in Bulgaria reached 1.5 mln persons per month, 61% of whom came from the European Union, which, in turn, suggests serious potential solvent demand for our products. In the recent years, the average annual increment of tourists in Bulgaria has comprised 6%. When marketing our products to this segment of the market we plan to cooperate with both local retailers of tourist products (tourist shops, kiosks, tents etc.), and larger wholesalers (tourist agencies, retail chains etc.).    

Individual customers will address us in order to get laser engravings on glass based on their individual preferences or designs or designs developed by us.     

Corporate clients, representing large, medium and small-scale businesses, various associations etc. This is a rather substantial segment of the market, which grows and regularly generates demand for various corporate gifts, souvenirs; items that promote brand awareness etc.     

Competition   

We know that there are a number of obstacles to entering the market of laser engravings on glass objects and the competition is rather high. There are several companies (Smartarts and Laser D) that offer similar services and products and we will have to compete with them. We see the main competitive advantage of our competitors in the established customer base and marketing outlets. But review of products of our competitors shows that our products are more exclusive, our assortment of products is wider, delivery times are faster, quality is better, approaches to business are more flexible and, very importantly, our equipment is more modern and efficient than that of the competitors, which gives us good chances for occupying a considerable market niche. Attracting new customers will be also supported by a client-oriented approach of Unicobe Corp., accentuating practical mutually beneficial cooperation with all the clients.  

One of our biggest competitive advantages is that our engraving machine is modern and efficient. This means that we are able to produce more products at the same period of time using fewer resources such as electricity, accompanying raw materials and consumables for the machine. The modern machine that is at our disposal also provides a wider range of creative possibilities at creating laser-engraved products, therefore allowing for another serious competitive advantage. Faster delivery time by Unicobe Corp., first of all, means the way we see our interaction with individual clients. One of the business operations of Unicobe Corp. is the selling of glass products manufactured according to the unique designs submitted by individual clients dedicated to special occasions, events, memorable moments, etc.  

Some of the competitive factors that may affect our business are as follows:  

  1. Number of Competitors Increase: other companies may follow our business model of distributing laser engraved glass billets, which will reduce our competitive edge.  

  2. Price: Our competitors may be selling similar product at a lower price forcing us to lower our prices as well and possibly sell our product at a loss.  

13        

3. Substitute Products: competitors may substitute laser engraved glass billets with similar products from plastic.  

Marketing   

The sales strategy will be based on communicating that owning a product by Unicobe Corp., either a mass-market souvenir or a high-end customs-made model, is a source of pride and appreciation. Memorable products by Unicobe Corp. attracts attention, as a piece of interior design always staying in sight, be it an individual customer or large corporate client or a tourist. Our products may also be considered as a long-term investment since the life cycle of our products is rather lengthy and the design stays up-to-date almost infinitely. Especially, given the fact that we plan to affix every product, including those distributed via retail points, with a business card with information about Unicobe Corp., information about the product and contact details. And in order to enhance the feeling of uniqueness of our products, we may also indicate a unique reference number on the business card to accompany each Unicobe Corp. product.  

We plan to distribute our products via several distribution channels simultaneously. As regards to the tourism segment, we plan to cooperate with retailers (kiosks, tourist souvenir shops etc.) and wholesalers (supermarkets, large retail chains, tourism agencies).  

Individual and corporate clients will be brought in, first of all, thanks to our prospective webpage, advertising in crowded areas and online promotion of our Company. In case of large corporate clients we also plan to focus on personal contacts with PR departments of large companies, presentations of our products, distribution of promotional leaflets, free samples and other measures to facilitate brand awareness of Unicobe Corp.  

Among others, we also intend to use such marketing strategies as web advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We plan to develop a website to market and display our products. As of the date of this filing we have already purchased a website (www.unicobecorp.com) and plan to develop it. To accomplish this, we plan to contract an independent web designing company. Our website will describe our product in detail, show our contact information, and include some general information and pictures of our laser engraved products, available designs, etc. We intend to attract traffic to our website by a variety of online marketing tactics such as registering with top search engines using selected key words and meta-tags, and utilizing link and banner exchange options. We intend to promote our website by displaying it on our promotion materials.  

We also plan to attend some trade shows and souvenir exhibitions to show our products with a view to find new customers. We will intend to continue our marketing efforts during the life of our operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and more importantly retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue and to successfully protect ourselves against those risks, then it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Results of Operations for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015:  

Revenue and cost of goods sold   

For the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 the Company generated total revenue of $12,766 and $3,180 respectively, from selling   laser engravings   products to its customers. The cost of goods sold for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $1,794 and $750 respectively, which represent the cost of raw materials  .   Increase in revenue is due to increase in sales and cooperation with new customers. Increase in gross profit for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 is due to purchase of different, cheaper raw materials.  

Operating expenses   

Total operating expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, were $12,391 and $6,005 respectively. The operating expenses included accounting fees of $3,500 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and $3,250 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015; bank charges of $303 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and $85 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015; depreciation expense of $336 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and $261 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015; regulatory filings of $6,200 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and $459 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015; legal fees of $1,500 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and $1,500 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015; and a rent expense of $552 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and $450 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015.   

Net Loss   

The net loss for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $1,419 and $3,575 respectively.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources and Cash Requirements   

At   September 30  , 2016, the Company had cash of $559 ($1,963 as of June 30, 2016).   Furthermore, the Company had a working capital deficit of $8,588 ($7,505 as of June   30, 2016  ). The increase in working capital deficit is attributed to losses from operations realized due to increasing operating activities of the business without generating commensurate revenue.   

During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company used $1,404 of cash in operating activities due to its net loss and decrease in raw material inventory of $927, increase in prepaid rent of $48, decrease in deferred revenue of $1,200 and depreciation of $336.    

During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company used no cash in investing activities.  

During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company generated no cash in financing activities  .   

Anatoliy Kanev, our sole officer and director, will be devoting approximately 75% of his time to our operations. Once we expand operations, and are able to attract more and more customers to buy our product, Mr. Kanev has agreed to commit more time as required. Because Mr. Kanev will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted which could result in a lack of revenues.  

There is no assurance that our company will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued working capital requirements.  

There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon   public offering   and achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity  

securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.  

15        

Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses, in their report on our audited financial statements, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.  

Limited operating history; need for additional capital   

There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   

As a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item.  

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   

Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a     15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.  

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 using the criteria established in  Internal Control - Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO - 2013").  

16        

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.  

1.           We do not have an Audit Committee   While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statements. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities.  

2.           We did not maintain appropriate cash controls   As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for cash, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signatures on the Company s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in its bank accounts.  

3.           We did not implement appropriate information technology controls   As at September 30, 2016, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.   

Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company s internal controls.  

As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.   

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting    

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during our first fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
