 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 -  ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.   General Description of the Partnership

Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. ( Partnership ) was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in June 2009.  The Partnership's general partner is Altegris Advisors, L.L.C. ( Advisors  or the "General Partner").  The Partnership speculatively trades commodity futures contracts, and may trade options on futures contracts, forward currency contracts and other commodity interests.  The objective of the Partnership s business is appreciation of its assets. It is subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the  CFTC ), an agency of the United States ( U.S. ) government that regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National Futures Association, an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of commodity exchanges and futures commission merchants (brokers) through which the Partnership trades.

B.   Method of Reporting

The Partnership s financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).  Therefore, the Partnership follows the accounting and reporting guidelines for investment companies. The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported fair value of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and reported amounts of income and expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Partnership s financial statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from these estimates and it is reasonably possible that the differences could be material. 

The financial information included herein is unaudited; however, such financial information reflects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements for the interim period.

C.   Fair Value

In accordance with the authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the  exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

ALTEGRIS QIM FUTURES FUND, L.P.  
  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C.  Fair Value (continued)

In determining fair value, the Partnership uses various valuation approaches. The authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Partnership. 

Unobservable inputs reflect the Partnership s assumption about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:

Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities that the Partnership has the ability to access at the measurement date;

Level 2   Quoted prices which are not active, or inputs that are observable (either directly or indirectly) for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and

Level 3   Prices, inputs or exotic modeling techniques which are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).

The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary among assets and liabilities and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset or liability, whether the asset or liability is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the asset or liability existed. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Partnership in determining fair value is greatest for assets and liabilities categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C.  Fair Value (continued)

Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Partnership s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The Partnership uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including prices and inputs during periods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many assets and liabilities. This condition could cause an asset or liability to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy.

The Partnership values futures contracts at the closing price of the contract s primary exchange.  The Partnership includes futures contracts in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as they are exchange traded derivatives.

The fair value of U.S. government agency bonds and notes is generally based on quoted prices in active markets. When quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on a valuation model that uses inputs which include interest-rate yield curves, cross-currency-basis index spreads, and country credit spreads similar to the bond in terms of issue, maturity and seniority. U.S. government agency bonds and notes are categorized in Level I or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, none of the Partnership s holdings in U.S. government agency bonds and notes were fair valued using valuation models.

The fair value of U.S. treasury obligations is generally based on quoted prices in active markets. U.S. treasury obligations are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value of corporate notes is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable), notes spreads or credit default swap spreads. The spread data used are for the same maturity as that of the notes. If the spread data does not reference the issuer, data that references a comparable issuer is used. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, notes, or single-name credit default swap spreads and recovery rates based on collateral values as key inputs. These valuation methods represent both a market and income approach to fair value measurement. Corporate notes are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; however, in instances where significant inputs are unobservable, they are categorized in Level 3 of the hierarchy. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, none of the Partnership s holdings in corporate notes were fair valued using valuation models.

C.  Fair Value (continued)

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

There were no changes in the Partnership s valuation methodology during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015.

The following table presents information about the Partnership s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

(1) 
 
 See Note 7. "Financial Derivative Instruments" for the fair value in each type of contracts within this category.

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, there were no Level 3 securities.

D.  Investment Transactions and Investment Income

Security transactions are recorded on the trade date for financial reporting purposes.  Realized gains and losses from security transactions are determined using the specific identification cost method. Change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the Statements of Income (Loss). Brokerage commissions on securities and other trading fees are reflected as an adjustment to cost or proceeds at the time of the transaction.  Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.

Gains or losses on futures contracts are realized when contracts are closed. Net unrealized gains or losses on open contracts (the difference between contract trade price and quoted market price) are reflected in the Statements of Financial Condition. Any change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the Statements of Income (Loss). Brokerage commissions on futures contracts include other trading fees and are incurred as an expense when contracts are opened, and are recognized as trading gains and losses.

Net realized gains and losses from foreign currency related transactions represent gains and losses from sales of foreign currencies, sales and maturities of futures contracts in foreign markets, currency gains and losses realized between trade and settlement dates on securities transactions, and the difference between the amounts of interest and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the Partnership s books and the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency denominated other assets and liabilities arise from changes in the value of assets, other than investments in securities, and liabilities at fiscal year end, resulting from changes in the exchange rates.

J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the  Custodian ) is the Partnership s custodian.  SG Americas Securities, LLC (the  Clearing Broker ) is the Partnership s commodity broker.  A portion of the Partnership s assets are held as initial margin or option premiums (in cash or Treasury securities) in the Partnership s brokerage accounts at the Clearing Broker.  The Partnership s assets not deposited at the Clearing Broker are deposited with either the Custodian or held in bank cash accounts at Northern Trust Company (and used to pay Partnership operating expenses).  For the Partnership s cash deposited at the Custodian, the Partnership receives cash management services from J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. ( JPMIM ).

E.   Futures Contracts

The Partnership engages in futures contracts as part of its investment strategy. Upon entering into a futures contract, the Partnership is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount. This is known as the  initial margin.  Subsequent payments ( variation margin ) are made or received by the Partnership each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract, and are included in unrealized gain (loss)on futures  contracts. Due to broker amounts on the Statements of Financial Condition represent the amount of any short fall in the Partnership s required cash margin. The Partnership recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.

NOTE 1 -  ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E. Futures Contracts (continued)

There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as an investment option. The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments. In addition, there is the risk that the Partnership may not be able to enter into a closing transaction because of an illiquid secondary market. Open positions in futures contracts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are reflected within the Condensed Schedules of Investments.

F.  Foreign Currency Transactions

The Partnership s functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, it transacts business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the date of the Statements of Financial Condition.  Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period.  Gains and losses resulting from the translation to U.S. dollars are reported in the Statements of Income (Loss).

G.  Cash

At times, the Partnership s cash balance could exceed the insured amount under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). The Partnership has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not subject to any significant counterparty risk related to its cash account.  

Both restricted cash and restricted foreign currency are held as margin collateral deposits for futures transactions.

H.  Offering Costs

Offering costs incurred in connection with the ongoing offering of the Partnership s interests are borne by the Partnership. These costs include, but are not limited to, legal fees pertaining to updating the Partnership s offering documents and materials, accounting and printing costs.  These costs are charged as an expense when incurred.

I.  Income Taxes

As an entity taxable as a partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes; the Partnership itself is not subject to Federal Income tax. The Partnership prepares and files calendar year U.S. and applicable state information tax returns and reports to the partners their allocable shares of the Partnership s income and expenses.

  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

I.  Income Taxes (continued)

The Partnership is required to determine whether its tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.  The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.  De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized results in the Partnership recording a tax liability that reduces ending partners  capital. Based on its analysis, the Partnership has determined that it has not incurred any liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  However, the Partnership s conclusions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Partnership is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities for all tax years since 2012.     

The Partnership recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and other expenses, respectively.   No interest expense or penalties have been recognized as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 or for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

NOTE 2 - PARTNERS  CAPITAL

A.  Capital Accounts and Allocation of Income and Loss

The Partnership accounts for subscriptions and redemptions on a per partner capital account basis.

The Partnership consists of the General Partner s Interest, Class A Interests, Class B Interests and Institutional Interests (collectively referred to as  Interests ).  Income or loss (prior to management fees, administrative fees, service fees and incentive fees) is allocated pro rata among the Limited Partners (each, a  Limited Partner  and collectively the  Limited Partners ) based on their respective capital accounts as of the end of each month in which the items accrue, pursuant to the terms of the Partnership s agreement of limited partnership, as may be amended and restated from time to time (the  Agreement ).  Class A Interests, Class B Interests and Institutional Interests are then charged with their applicable management fee, administrative fee, service fee and incentive fee in accordance with the Agreement.

No Limited Partner of the Partnership shall be liable for any debts or liabilities of the Partnership or any losses thereof in excess of such Limited Partner's capital contributions, except as may be required by law.

The Partnership is not required to make distributions, but may do so at the sole discretion of the General Partner.  A Limited Partner may request and receive redemption of capital, subject to restrictions set forth in the Agreement.  The General Partner may request and receive redemption of capital, subject to the same terms as any Limited Partner. The partners may withdraw their interests on a monthly basis upon at least 15 days  prior written notice, subject to the discretion of the General Partner. No distributions were made for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

NOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

A.  General Partner Management Fee

The General Partner may declare any Limited Partner a  Special Limited Partner  and the management fees or incentive fees charged to any such partner may be different than those charged to other Limited Partners. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no Special Limited Partners.

Total management fees earned by the General Partner for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are shown on the Statements of Income (Loss) as Management Fee.

C.  Altegris Investments, L.L.C. and Altegris Clearing Solutions, L.L.C.

Altegris Investments, L.L.C. ( Altegris Investments ), an affiliate of the General Partner, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and effective as of December 31, 2014, was converted from an Arkansas corporation (Altegris Investments, Inc.) to a Delaware limited liability company (Altegris Investments, L.L.C.). For the year ended December 31, 2015, Altegris Clearing Solutions, L.L.C. (Altegris Clearing Solutions), an affiliate of the General Partner and an introducing broker registered with the CFTC, was the Partnership s introducing broker. On December 31, 2014, Altegris Futures was merged with and into Altegris Clearing Solutions and thereafter dissolved. Altegris Clearing Solutions was the surviving entity (Altegris Clearing Solutions is referred to as the  introducing broker  of the Partnership).

Altegris Investments has entered into a selling agreement with the Partnership whereby it receives 2% per annum as continuing compensation for Class A Interests sold by Altegris Investments that are outstanding at month end. The Partnership s introducing broker receives a portion of the commodity brokerage commissions paid by the Partnership to the Clearing Broker and interest income retained by the Clearing Broker. Additionally, the Partnership pays to its clearing brokers and its introducing broker, at a minimum, brokerage charges at a flat rate of 0.125% (1.5% annually) of the Partnership s management fee net asset value. Brokerage charges may exceed the flat rate described above, depending on commission and trading volume levels, which may vary.

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the Partnership had charges for brokerage-related services payable to Altegris Clearing Solutions of $14,294 and $2,993 and service fees payable to Altegris Investments of $5,256 and $5,155, respectively. The following tables show the fees paid to Altegris Investments and Altegris Clearing Solutions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:

The amounts above are included in Brokerage Commissions and Service Fees on the Statements of Income (Loss), respectively. The amounts shown on the Statements of Income (Loss) include fees paid to non-related parties.

NOTE 7 -  FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Partnership engages in the speculative trading of futures contracts for the purpose of achieving capital appreciation.  None of the Partnership s derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in the  Derivatives and Hedging  Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ), nor are they used for other risk management purposes.  The Advisor and General Partner actively assess, manage and monitor risk exposure on derivatives on a contract basis, a sector basis (e.g., interest rate derivatives, agricultural derivatives, etc.), and on an overall basis in accordance with established risk parameters.  Due to the speculative nature of the Partnership s derivative trading activity, the Partnership is subject to the risk of substantial losses from derivatives trading.

The following presents the fair value of derivative contracts as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The fair value of derivative contracts is presented as an asset if in a gain position and a liability if in a loss position.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 8 -  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.  The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.  Further, the Clearing Broker has the right to require margin in excess of the minimum exchange requirement.  Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) and the potential inability of brokers to perform under the terms of their contracts (credit risk).

All of the contracts currently traded by the Partnership are exchange traded.  The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.  However, in the future, if the Partnership were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.  The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any.

The Partnership also has credit risk because the sole counterparty to all domestic futures contracts is the exchange clearing corporation.  In addition, the Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by the Clearing Broker. The Partnership's policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial position and credit exposure reporting and control procedures.  In addition, the Partnership has a policy of reviewing the credit standing of each clearing broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.

The Partnership has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with the Custodian in U.S. government agency bonds and notes and corporate notes.  Risks arise from investments in bonds and notes due to possible illiquidity and the potential for default by the issuer or counterparty.  Such instruments are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and economic conditions.

NOTE 9 -  INDEMNIFICATIONS

In the normal course of business, the Partnership enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications.  The Partnership s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Partnership that have not yet occurred.  The Partnership expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote.

PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION   (continued)

Item 2:     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

Reference is made to  Item 1: Financial Statements.  The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in conjunction with, the following analysis.

Liquidity

The Partnership s assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents, which are used to margin the Partnership s futures positions and are sold to pay redemptions and expenses as needed.  Other than any potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, the Partnership s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so.  Market-imposed limitations, when they occur, can be due to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Partnership s futures trading.  A portion of the Partnership s assets not used for margin and held with the Custodian are invested in liquid, high quality securities.  Through September 30, 2016 the Partnership experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the markets traded by Quantitative Investment Management LLC (the  Advisor ) on behalf of the Partnership.

Capital Resources

The Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of Interests and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income.  The Partnership does not engage in borrowing.

The amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for capital to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and expenses.  Within broad ranges of capitalization, the Partnership s trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Partnership.

The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts and may trade options on futures contracts and forward contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.  The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.  Further, the Partnership s futures commission merchants and brokers may require margin in excess of minimum exchange requirements.

All of the futures contracts currently traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership are exchange-traded.  The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its trading counterparties, whereas exchange-traded contracts are generally, but not universally, backed by the collective credit of the members of the exchange.  In the future, the Partnership anticipates that it will enter into non-exchange-traded foreign currency contracts and be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.

The Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by the Clearing Broker and/or other clearing brokers or counterparties with which the Partnership trades. 

Results of Operations

The Partnership s success depends primarily upon the Advisor s ability to recognize and capitalize on market trends in the sectors of the global commodity futures markets in which it trades.  The Partnership seeks to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.  The past performance of the Partnership is not necessarily indicative of future results.

Due to the nature of the Partnership s trading, the results of operations for the interim period presented should not be considered indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.

Performance Summary

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 

During the third quarter of 2016, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $981,287 from its trading activities, net of brokerage commissions of $105,102.  The Partnership accrued total expenses of $525,775, including $85,615 in management fees paid to the General Partner, $259,182 in incentive fees, and $147,019 in service and professional fees.  The Partnership earned $11,155 in interest income during the third quarter of 2016.  An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for the third quarter of 2016 is set forth below. 

Third Quarter 2016  .  The Partnership was mixed for the month of July 2016, ending the month flat to slightly negative.  The only profitable sector was stock indices. Interest rates were the worst performing sector, followed by energies. Returns initially had a strong start with long U.S. and short European stock index positions but lingering concerns over the impact of Brexit weighed on European indices, while U.S. indices outperformed on the back of a surprisingly strong nonfarm payroll number on July 8th.  Performance in stock indices remained strong throughout the month; however, losses in long interest rate positions offset much of these gains as bonds moved higher on the increased probability of rate hikes.  The Partnership remained net long stock indices but reversed into short interest rate futures in anticipation of an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.. As expected, rates were left unchanged and, despite a hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve, stocks and bonds both traded higher with losses in interest rate futures offsetting gains in stock indices. Thereafter, focus shifted to the Bank of Japan meeting, which disappointed markets with a less accommodative monetary and fiscal policy than had been expected. The Yen surged higher and the Partnership s short Yen position eroded much of the overall gains going into month end.  In August 2016, the Partnership experienced positive overall performance with the most profitable sector being interest rates, followed closely by stock indices. Metals were slightly positive, while the currency and energy sectors were both negative. The Partnership initially profited as with net long stock index and short interest rate positions, as the S P and Nasdaq soared to record highs, and then reversed into short stock indices in the middle of the month as equity markets became increasingly choppy.  Despite a decidedly hawkish tone by the Federal Reserve at an August 2016 meeting, equity markets traded higher into month end, paring gains in the stock index sector. Losses in the currency sector early in the month were attributed to a short Yen position that declined when the Bank of Japan announced stimulus measures that did not include further monetary easing. By month end, the Partnership had reversed into long currency positions and suffered additional losses as the U.S. Dollar surged.  In September 2016, the Partnership experienced solid profits as the main driver of performance was stock indices, whereas the worst performing sector was currencies.  The Partnership came into the month short global equity indices and achieved mixed results through the first week of trading.  Between September 9th   10th, signals in equity indices reversed as global stock markets sold off dramatically on the 9th and rallied back on the 10th. The Partnership earned significant profits on both sides of the trade, and returns remained long going into the September Federal Reserve, which spurred a two-day rally in U.S. equity markets. The Partnership then gave back a portion of gains as markets became increasingly choppy going into month end.  Currency losses accrued early in the month and were primarily attributable to short Euro positions as a hawkish European Central Bank meeting sent the currency sharply higher. The bulk of the losses in energies came in the last week of trading when short crude positions suffered on the news that OPEC had reached a preliminary agreement on the first production cuts in eight years.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

During the third quarter of 2015, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $1,557,592 from its trading activities, net of brokerage commissions of $98,144. The Partnership accrued total expenses of $283,216, including $80,105 in management fees paid to the General Partner, $33,346 in incentive fees, and $133,166 in service and professional fees. The Partnership earned $5,802 in interest income during the third quarter of 2015. An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for the third quarter of 2015 is set forth below.

Third Quarter 2015  .  The Partnership experienced a loss in July 2015 primarily from its long and short futures positions in U.S. and European stock indices. The Partnership experienced gains from its short positions in futures contracts on Crude Oil, Brent Oil and Gold as commodity weakness drove these markets lower during the month. The Partnership also benefited from its positions in interest rate futures. At the end of the month as a result of its ongoing market analysis, the Advisor discontinued trading in TOPIX, Gas Oil, Heating Oil, RBOB Gasoline, S P 400 E-mini, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso and CBOE Vix contracts. The Partnership achieved a gain in August 2015 driven by profitable positioning in futures contracts on U.S. and European stock indices. On August 11th the PBOC unexpectedly began to devalue the Yuan in a series of moves that would send shockwaves through global financial markets. Fears of an economic slowdown led to a flight to quality, and the Partnership benefitted from both short positions in stock indices and long positions in interest rate futures. Short positions in energy futures contracts detracted from the performance of the Partnership. The Partnership experienced a gain in September 2015 with the bulk of the positive performance coming from short positions in futures on stock indices. At the beginning of the month, the PBOC announced more stringent capital controls resulting in a 10% drop in the price of crude oil. The Partnership was well positioned in advance of the PBOC announcement by having short positions in crude oil contracts. Currencies were the only sector with negative performance during the month, and the Partnership s positions in currencies detracted from performance.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $3,753,899 from its trading activities, net of brokerage commissions of $302,670.  The Partnership accrued total  expenses of $1,405,265, including $246,404 in management fees paid to the General Partner, $587,721 in incentive fees, and $439,232 in service and professional fees.  The Partnership earned $31,679 in interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is set forth below. 

Third Quarter 2016  .  Third Quarter 2016.  The Partnership was mixed for the month of July 2016, ending the month flat to slightly negative.  The only profitable sector was stock indices. Interest rates were the worst performing sector, followed by energies. Returns initially had a strong start with long U.S. and short European stock index positions but lingering concerns over the impact of Brexit weighed on European indices, while U.S. indices outperformed on the back of a surprisingly strong nonfarm payroll number on July 8th.  Performance in stock indices remained strong throughout the month; however, losses in long interest rate positions offset much of these gains as bonds moved higher on the increased probability of rate hikes.

As expected, rates were left unchanged and, despite a hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve, stocks and bonds both traded higher with losses in interest rate futures offsetting gains in stock indices. Thereafter, focus shifted to the Bank of Japan meeting, which disappointed markets with a less accommodative monetary and fiscal policy than had been expected. The Yen surged higher and the Partnership s short Yen position eroded much of the overall gains going into month end.  In August 2016, the Partnership experienced positive overall performance with the most profitable sector being interest rates, followed closely by stock indices. Metals were slightly positive, while the currency and energy sectors were both negative. The Partnership initially profited as with net long stock index and short interest rate positions, as the S P and Nasdaq soared to record highs, and then reversed into short stock indices in the middle of the month as equity markets became increasingly choppy.  Despite a decidedly hawkish tone by the Federal Reserve at an August 2016 meeting, equity markets traded higher into month end, paring gains in the stock index sector. Losses in the currency sector early in the month were attributed to a short Yen position that declined when the Bank of Japan announced stimulus measures that did not include further monetary easing. By month end, the Partnership had reversed into long currency positions and suffered additional losses as the U.S. Dollar surged.  In September 2016, the Partnership experienced solid profits as the main driver of performance was stock indices, whereas the worst performing sector was currencies.  The Partnership came into the month short global equity indices and achieved mixed results through the first week of trading.  Between September 9th   10th, signals in equity indices reversed as global stock markets sold off dramatically on the 9th and rallied back on the 10th. The Partnership earned significant profits on both sides of the trade, and returns remained long going into the September Federal Reserve, which spurred a two-day rally in U.S. equity markets. The Partnership then gave back a portion of gains as markets became increasingly choppy going into month end.  Currency losses accrued early in the month and were primarily attributable to short Euro positions as a hawkish European Central Bank meeting sent the currency sharply higher. The bulk of the losses in energies came in the last week of trading when short crude positions suffered on the news that OPEC had reached a preliminary agreement on the first production cuts in eight years.

Second Quarter 2016  .  The Partnership was flat to slightly negative for the month of April 2016. Currencies were the most profitable sector, followed by stock indices and metals. Interest rates were the worst performing sector, followed by energies. The Partnership came into the month short all stock index contracts, making substantial profits in the first week of trading as equity markets traded lower. As the month wore on, equity markets recovered on the back of a marginally positive earnings season domestically and the lack of any significant negative headlines internationally. The Partnership maintained a net short position as markets trended higher, erasing earlier profits and going negative in the sector until equity markets began to falter late in the month on disappointing news from the Bank of Japan as to its leaving rates unchanged and failing to increase stimulus. This sent equity markets sharply lower and the Yen skyrocketed to new multi-year highs   resulting in gains for the Partnership. While bonds moved lower on equity strength, the possibility of a June rate hike from the FOMC limited the upside as equities sold off. The Partnership experienced profits in May 2016, with the most profitable sector being stock indices, followed by interest rates and currencies. Following a late April FOMC statement that lowered the likelihood for a June 2016 rate hike, concerns regarding the global economy were further heightened in the first week of May by weak Caixin PMI data in China and disappointing nonfarm payroll numbers in the United States. These events caused a flight to quality during early in the month. During this period, the Partnership traded the Euro-Bund, U.S. 30-Year Bond, Long Gilt, S P and Hang Seng futures contracts to secure gains in the interest rates and stock indices sectors. As the month progressed, a shift in the Federal Reserve s tone indicated a likely rate hike due to an improving economy, and coupled with substantial short covering and reports of a surge in U.S. new home sales, a strong rally in equity indices and commodities ensued (offset by a decline in global interest rate futures). The second half of May saw the Partnership benefitting from long positions in U.S. equity indices, while it suffered from short positions in European equity indices and long positions across U.S. Treasuries. The Partnership was up slightly for the month of June 2016, with the most profitable sector being stock indices, followed by interest rates. The only negative sector was currencies. Volatility across global financial markets was largely driven by expectations and reactions around the FOMC decision to hold on an interest rate hike5th and the U.K. referendum vote. With the uncertainty of an interest rate hike removed, attention became squarely focused on the outcome of Brexit vote. As resultant volatility ensued, Partnership benefitted from positions in the DJ Euro Stoxx 50, Dax, U.S. 30-Year Bond and Gold, and risk exposure leading up to the Brexit vote was reduced. The Partnership suffered losses during the days preceding the Brexit vote but recouped most of those losses as markets reacted sharply to the surprising decision by the U.K. to leave the European Union. Over the last three days of June 2016, the Partnership gave back profits in the stock indices sector as global equity markets rallied.

- 28 - 

First Quarter 2016  .  The Partnership experienced net gains for the month of January 2016, with interest rates contributing most of the profits, followed by stock indices; whereas on the negative side, energies were the worst performing sector, followed by currency positions that also suffered declines in the period. The Partnership maintained short positions in U.S.   European stock indices and long positions in interest rates throughout January resulting in strong returns early in the month. The Partnership initially posted modest gains from short crude oil positions before reversing into substantial long positions thereafter. After a temporary rally, the price of crude oil resumed its downward trend, causing the long positions to sustain losses by month-end. The Bank of Japan announced a negative interest rate policy near month-end, with equity markets trading higher while the Yen dropped sharply   costing the Partnership a significant portion of the gains it had made earlier in the month. The Partnership enjoyed solid net positive performance for the month of February 2016, led by gains in stock indices, followed by positive returns in the interest rates, energies and currencies sectors. The only negative sector for the month was metals. Short positions in crude oil and stock indices benefitted from global growth early in the period. Upon reversing the shorts into longs mid-month, the Partnership s positions in stock indices and crude oil profited due to positive economic data and rallying markets, followed by the Partnership reversing again to shorts allowing it to eke out marginal additional gains as equity markets remained choppy through month-end. A long position in Yen held throughout the month of February was responsible for most of the profits that month in the currencies sector. The Partnership s losses in the metals sector for the period were attributed to a short Gold position as that market trended higher. The Partnership sustained a net loss for the month of March 2016, with stock indices being the worst-performing sector, and currencies, interest rates and energies each experiencing slightly negative returns. The only positive sector was metals for the period. Losses were sustained in short stock index positions and long interest rate positions were due to strong economic data coupled with dovish statements from the Federal Reserve leading to the perception that, despite improving economic conditions, a rate hike was unlikely in March. Short positions in currencies and energies added to losses as the U.S. Dollar surged and commodity prices moved higher throughout the period. The metals sector was the only bright spot in March, as the Partnership began the month short metals, then reversed mid-month into long positions, making back earlier losses and posting moderate gains as Gold rose on continued bullish sentiment.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $4,626,213 from its trading activities, net of brokerage commissions of $349,694. The Partnership accrued total expenses of $954,342, including $282,394 in management fees paid to the General Partner, $44,852 in incentive fees, and $444,506 in service and professional fees. The Partnership earned $22,673 in interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is set forth below.

- 29 - 

Third Quarter 2015  .  The Partnership experienced a loss in July 2015 primarily from its long and short futures positions in U.S. and European stock indices. The Partnership experienced gains from its short positions in futures contracts on Crude Oil, Brent Oil and Gold as commodity weakness drove these markets lower during the month. The Partnership also benefited from its positions in interest rate futures. At the end of the month as a result of its ongoing market analysis, the Advisor discontinued trading in TOPIX, Gas Oil, Heating Oil, RBOB Gasoline, S P 400 E-mini, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso and CBOE Vix contracts. The Partnership achieved a gain in August 2015 driven by profitable positioning in futures contracts on U.S. and European stock indices. On August 11th the PBOC unexpectedly began to devalue the Yuan in a series of moves that would send shockwaves through global financial markets. Fears of an economic slowdown led to a flight to quality, and the Partnership benefitted from both short positions in stock indices and long positions in interest rate futures. Short positions in energy futures contracts detracted from the performance of the Partnership. The Partnership experienced a gain in September 2015 with the bulk of the positive performance coming from short positions in futures on stock indices. At the beginning of the month, the PBOC announced more stringent capital controls resulting in a 10% drop in the price of crude oil. The Partnership was well positioned in advance of the PBOC announcement by having short positions in crude oil contracts. Currencies were the only sector with negative performance during the month, and the Partnership s positions in currencies detracted from performance.

Second Quarter 2015  .  The Partnership experienced a gain in April 2015 primarily driven by long positions in futures contracts in the currency sector. The Partnership achieved gains in its trading of futures contracts on the Euro and the British Pound. Performance was also benefited by short positions at the end of the month in the Euro-Bund. The Partnership s long futures positions in the Hang Seng China Enterprises and Hang Seng and long and short positions in the U.S. treasury futures contributed positively to performance. The Partnership s short positions in the FTSE China A50 and futures positions on European and U.S. stock indices detracted from performance. The Partnership experienced a slight gain in May 2015. After U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Yellen s comments on May 6th that equity market valuations appeared high, the S P closed at its lowest level in over a month, and the Partnership experienced a loss in the first full week of trading since taking long positions. The Partnership experienced gains from trading during the month in long and short futures positions in the Euro and in short positions in the FTSE China A50. The Partnership experienced mid-month losses in equity market futures, which were more than offset by strong sell signals in European interest rate futures. The Partnership s gain in June 2015 was almost entirely attributed to trading in fixed income markets with minor gains in stock indices. The Partnership s long and short positions in interest rate futures, most notably the Euro-Bund, contributed positively to performance. Performance also benefited from short positions in FTSE China A50 futures and in positions in the DJ Euro Stoxx 50.The energy sector was the worst performing sector followed by a small loss in the currency sector. The Partnership s futures position in crude oil contracts generated the largest losses in the Partnership s energy sector positions.

First Quarter 2015  .  The Partnership experience a slight loss in January largely driven by positions in futures contracts on the Euro, energy and European interest rates. Long positions in futures contracts on U.S. Treasuries and short positions in futures contracts in the FTSE China A50 index and the S P index contributed to performance. Long positions in the Euro abruptly turned negative against a market downturn the week following the Swiss National Bank s decision to abandon its peg to the Euro. The Partnership s performance was adversely impacted by long positions in futures contracts in Crude Oil and Brent Oil. Short positions in European interest rates were the largest detractors to performance during the month. Steady long positions in futures contracts on U.S. Treasuries contributed positively to performance throughout the month. The Partnership also benefited from holding short positions in futures contracts on the FTSE China A50 and S P indices. The Partnership experienced a gain in February driven by gains in all sectors except metals. Global stock markets generally climbed throughout the month, a trend that was profitably exploited by the Partnership s long positions across most markets. Long positions in the DJ Stoxx 50 and the Dax indices were the largest contributors to performance during the month. The Partnership s performance also benefited from short positions in the Euro-Bund and long positions in the UK Gilt bond. The Partnership experienced gains on short and long positions in Crude Oil as that market ebbed and flowed several times over the month. Long positions in Gold adversely impacted the Partnership s performance. Short positions in futures contracts on U.S. Treasuries detracted from performance. The Partnership experienced a loss in March largely driven by losses in currencies, U.S. stock indices and energies. Long positions in futures contracts on the Euro were chiefly responsible for the month s overall performance, as the Euro declined significantly through mid-month against the Partnership s long position. Performance was also adversely impacted by long positions in futures contracts on the S P index early in the month with a mid-month pivot to short positions in the S P index further degrading performance. Short positions in the Euro-Bund also hurt performance. Performance benefited from both long and short positions in futures contracts on U.S. Treasuries, the FTSE China A50, Dax and DJ Euro Stoxx 50 indices and the energy sector.
