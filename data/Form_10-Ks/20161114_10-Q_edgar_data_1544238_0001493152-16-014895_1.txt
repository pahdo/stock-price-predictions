NOTE
1   COMPANY BACKGROUND  

Cardax
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Holdings ) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 23, 2006.  

In
May of 2006, Hawaii Biotech, Inc., contributed its anti-inflammatory, small molecule line of business into Holdings. Holdings
issued (i) 9,447,100 shares of common stock of Holdings, (ii) 14,440,920 shares of Series A preferred stock of Holdings, (iii)
11,113,544 shares of Series B preferred stock of Holdings and (iv) 13,859,324 shares of Series C preferred stock of Holdings to
Hawaii Biotech, Inc., in exchange for the assets and liabilities contributed to Holdings. The above shares were then distributed
by Hawaii Biotech, Inc. to its shareholders. An additional 704,225 shares of Series C preferred stock were issued as part of the
initial capitalization of Holdings. On January 30, 2007, all outstanding shares of Series A, B, and C preferred stock were converted
into shares of Series A preferred stock.  

Holdings
was formed for the purpose of developing a platform of proprietary, exceptionally safe, small molecule compounds for large unmet
medical needs where oxidative stress and inflammation play important causative roles. Holdings  platform has application
in arthritis, metabolic syndrome, liver disease, and cardiovascular disease, as well as macular degeneration and prostate disease.
Holdings  current primary focus is on the development of astaxanthin technologies. Astaxanthin is a naturally occurring
marine compound that has robust anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.  

In
May of 2013, Holdings formed a 100% owned subsidiary company called Cardax Pharma, Inc. ( Pharma ). Pharma was formed
to maintain Holdings  operations going forward, leaving Holdings as an investment holding company.  

On
November 29, 2013, Holdings entered into a definitive merger agreement ( Merger Agreement ) with Koffee Korner Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ( Koffee Korner ) (OTCQB:KOFF), and its wholly owned subsidiary ( Koffee Sub ),
pursuant to which, among other matters and subject to the conditions set forth in such Merger Agreement, Koffee Sub would merge
with and into Pharma. In connection with such merger agreement and related agreements, upon the consummation of such merger, Pharma
would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Koffee Korner and Koffee Korner would issue shares of its common stock to Holdings.
At the effective time of such merger, Holdings would own a majority of the shares of the then issued and outstanding shares of
common stock of Koffee Korner.  

On
February 7, 2014, Holdings completed its merger with Koffee Korner, which was renamed to Cardax, Inc. (the  Company )
(OTCQB:CDXI). Concurrent with the merger: (i) the Company received aggregate gross cash proceeds of $3,923,100 in exchange for
the issuance and sale of an aggregate 6,276,960 of shares of the Company s common stock, together with five year warrants
to purchase an aggregate of 6,276,960 shares of the Company s common stock at $0.625 per share, (ii) the notes issued on
January 3, 2014, in the outstanding principal amount of $2,076,000 and all accrued interest thereon, automatically converted into
3,353,437 shares of the Company s common stock upon the reverse merger at $0.625 per share, together with five year warrants
to purchase 3,321,600 shares of common stock at $0.625 per share, (iii) the notes issued in 2013, in the outstanding principal
amount of $8,489,036 and all accrued interest thereon, automatically converted into 14,446,777 shares of the Company s common
stock upon the reverse merger at $0.625 per share, together with five year warrants to purchase 14,446,777 shares of common stock
at $0.625 per share, (iv) stock options to purchase 15,290,486 shares of Holdings common stock at $0.07 per share were cancelled
and substituted with stock options to purchase 6,889,555 shares of the Company s common stock at $0.155 per share, (v) additional
stock options to purchase 20,867,266 shares of the Company s common stock at $0.625 per share were issued, and (vi) the
notes issued in 2008 and 2009, in the outstanding principal amounts of $55,000 and $500,000, respectively, and all accrued interest
thereon, were repaid in full. The assets and liabilities of Koffee Korner were distributed in accordance with the terms of a spin-off
agreement on the closing date.

NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE
1   COMPANY BACKGROUND (continued)  

The
share exchange transaction was treated as a reverse acquisition, with Holdings and Pharma as the acquirers and Koffee Korner and
Koffee Sub as the acquired parties. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when the Company refers to business and financial information
for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, the Company is referring to the business and financial information
of Holdings and Pharma. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP )
guidance Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 805-40,  Business Combinations   Reverse Acquisitions ,
the Acquisition has been treated as a reverse acquisition with no adjustment to the historical book and tax basis of the Company s
assets and liabilities.  

On
August 28, 2014, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Holdings Merger Agreement ) with its
principal stockholder, Holdings, pursuant to which Holdings would merge with and into the Company (the  Holdings Merger ).
On September 18, 2015, the Company filed a Form S-4 with the SEC in contemplation of the Holdings Merger. There would not be any
cash consideration exchanged in the Holdings Merger. Upon the closing of the Holdings Merger, the stockholders of Holdings would
receive an aggregate number of shares and warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock equal to the aggregate
number of shares of the Company s common stock that were held by Holdings on the date of the closing of the Holdings Merger.
The Company s restricted shares of common stock held by Holdings would be cancelled upon the closing of the Holdings Merger.
Accordingly, there would not be not any change to the Company s fully diluted capitalization due to the Holdings Merger.  

On
November 24, 2015, the Holdings Merger Agreement was amended and restated (the  Amended Holdings Merger Agreement ).
Under the terms of Amended Holdings Merger Agreement, the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share of Holdings and the
shares of all other issued and outstanding capital stock of Holdings that by their terms were convertible or could otherwise be
exchanged for shares of Holdings common stock, would be converted into and exchanged for the Company s shares of Common
Stock in a ratio of approximately 2.2:1. In addition, the Company would grant Holdings  option and warrant holders warrants
to purchase the Company s warrants at the same stock conversion ratio. On November 24, 2015, the Company filed an amendment
to the Form S-4 with the SEC and on December 29, 2015, the Form S-4 was declared effective by the SEC.  

On
December 30, 2015, the Company completed its merger with Holdings, pursuant to the Amended Holdings Merger Agreement. At closing,
Holdings merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Holdings Merger. Pursuant to the Amended Holdings Merger
Agreement, there was not any cash consideration exchanged in the Holdings Merger. Upon the closing of the Holdings Merger, the
stockholders of Holdings received an aggregate number of shares and warrants to purchase shares of Company common stock equal
to the aggregate number of shares of Company common stock that were held by Holdings on the date of the closing of the Holdings
Merger. The Company s restricted shares of common stock held by Holdings were cancelled upon the closing of the Holdings
Merger. Accordingly, there was not any change to the Company s fully diluted capitalization due to the Holdings Merger.  

Going
concern matters   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $482,438 and $1,387,926 for the three and nine-months ended September
30, 2016, respectively, and a net loss of $743,461 and $2,443,881 for the three and nine-months ended 2015, respectively. The
Company has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $55,538,083 as of September 30, 2016, and has
had negative cash flows from operating activities since inception. The Company anticipates further losses in the development of
its business. As a result of these and other factors, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm has determined
there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

Inc., and Subsidiary  

NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE
1   COMPANY BACKGROUND (continued)  

In addition to the  $985,000
 raised in the calendar year through November 14, 2016, the Company plans to raise additional capital to carry out its
business plan. The Company s ability to raise additional capital through future equity and debt securities issuances is
unknown. Obtaining additional financing, the successful development of the Company s contemplated plan of operations, and
its transition, ultimately, to profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully
resolve these factors raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed
consolidated financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

On
March 28, 2016, the Company furloughed all of its employees and independent contractors indefinitely and arranged with its Chief
Executive Officer, David G. Watumull; its Chief Financial Officer, John B. Russell; and its Vice President, Operations, David
M. Watumull, to continue their services for cash compensation equal to the minimum wage. On May 30, 2016, the compensation arrangement
of our Vice President, Operations, David M. Watumull, was amended so that he would receive bi-weekly compensation equal to $3,269.
On May 30, 2016, the compensation arrangement of our Vice President, Research, Timothy J. King, was amended so that he would receive
bi-weekly compensation equal to $1,635. The Company continues to assess its commercial opportunities, which may include developing
products or licensing its intellectual property, and may re-engage furloughed employees and contractors from time to time to the
extent their services are required. In addition, each of the directors has agreed, effective April 1, 2016, to suspend any additional
equity compensation, until otherwise agreed by the Company. In addition, the Company has deferred payment of other trade payables.
On September 6, 2016, the compensation arrangements of certain officers were amended so that effective September 8, 2016, (i)
our Chief Executive Officer, David G. Watumull would receive bi-weekly compensation equal to $4,327, (ii) our Chief Science Officer,
Gilbert M. Rishton would receive bi-weekly compensation equal to $1,923, and (iii) our Vice President, Research, Timothy J. King
would receive bi-weekly compensation equal to $3,269. On September 6, 2016, the compensation arrangement with JBR Business Solutions,
LLC, under which John B. Russell serves as our Chief Financial Officer, was amended so that effective September 30, 2016, he would
receive monthly compensation of $3,500. On September 6, 2016, the compensation arrangements of the independent directors of the
Company were amended so that effective September 30, 2016, they would each receive quarterly equity compensation of $12,500 in
arrears in the form of a grant of shares of our common stock or non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of the Company s
common stock under the Cardax, Inc. 2014 Equity Compensation Plan based on the higher of the then current market price or $0.15
per share, with such compensation prorated for one of three months for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis
of presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for interim financial information. In the opinion
of the Company s management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting
of normal, recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. Although management believes that the disclosures in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in financial statements that have been prepared in accordance U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the SEC.  

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cardax, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiary, Cardax Pharma,
Inc., and its predecessor, Cardax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which was merged with and into Cardax, Inc., on December 30, 2015. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.
Estimates in these condensed consolidated financial statements include asset valuations, estimates of future cash flows from and
the economic useful lives of long-lived assets, valuations of stock compensation, certain accrued liabilities, income taxes and
tax valuation allowances, and fair value estimates. Despite management s intention to establish accurate estimates and reasonable
assumptions, actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.  

Inventory   

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the average cost method. Market is defined as sales price less
cost to dispose and a normal profit margin. Inventory costs include materials and third party costs.  

The
Company provides a reserve against inventory for known or expected inventory obsolescence. The reserve is determined by specific
review of inventory items for product age and quality that may affect salability.  

Revenue
recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue when the transfer of title and risk of loss occurs. For shipments with terms of FOB Shipping Point,
revenue is recognized upon shipment. For shipments with terms of FOB Destination, revenue is recognized upon delivery.  

Sales
returns and allowances are recorded as a reduction to sales in the period in which sales are recorded. The Company records shipping
charges and sales tax gross in revenues and cost of goods sold.  

Reclassifications   

The
Company has made certain reclassifications to conform its prior periods  data to the current presentation. These reclassifications
had no effect on the reported results of operations or cash flows.

2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  

Recent
accounting pronouncements   

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , related to revenue recognition. The underlying principle of the new
standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. The standard also requires more
detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in prior accounting
guidance. ASU 2014-09 provides alternative methods of initial adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this
ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , that requires inventory
not measured using either the last in, first out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method to be measured at the lower of cost and
net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and will be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective
Date , which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year to December 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after that date and permitted early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date. The
Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases . The main provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 require management to recognize
lease assets and lease liabilities for all leases. ASU 2016-02 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases.
The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification
criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous leases guidance. The result of retaining
a distinction between finance leases and operating leases is that under the lessee accounting model, the effect of leases in the
statement of comprehensive income and the statement of cash flows is largely unchanged from previous GAAP. The amendments in this
ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The
Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation . The amendments of ASU No. 2016-09 were
issued as part of the FASB's simplification initiative focused on improving areas of GAAP for which cost and complexity may be
reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of information disclosed within the financial statements. The amendments
focused on simplification specifically with regard to share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification
of awards as equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance in ASU No. 2016-09 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.

On
March 23, 2006, Holdings was authorized to issue 10,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. On May 5,
2006, the Articles of Incorporation were amended and restated. As part of this amendment, the number of authorized shares increased
to 219,582,802 of which 127,000,000 were designated as common stock and the remaining 92,582,802 was designated as preferred stock.
The 92,582,802 of preferred stock was allocated 14,440,920 to Series A, 11,113,544 Series B, 42,028,338 to Series C with 25,000,000
undesignated. Par value for all classes of stock was $0.001.  

On
January 30, 2007, the Articles of Incorporation were amended and restated. As part of this amendment, the number of authorized
shares increased to 245,673,568 of which 150,000,000 were designated as common stock and the remaining 95,673,568 was designated

of Series A preferred stock. Par value for all classes of stock was $0.001.  

Dividends
- Holdings   

Subject
to the rights of any series of Preferred Stock that may from time to time come into existence, the holders of Series A and Series
B preferred stock were entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available
therefor, dividends at the rate of 8.5% of the original Series A Series and B issue prices, per annum, on each outstanding share
of Series A and Series B preferred stock on a pari passu basis, payable in preference and priority to any payment of any dividend
on common stock of the Company for such year. The right to such dividends on Preferred Stock were not cumulative, and no rights
were to be accrued to the holders of Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that the Company may have failed to declare or pay
dividends on Preferred Stock in any previous fiscal year of the Company, whether or not earnings of the Company where sufficient
to pay such dividends. No dividend was to be paid on common stock in any year, other than dividends payable solely in common stock,
until all dividends for such year had been declared and paid on preferred stock. No dividends were accrued or paid during the
three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 or year ended December 31, 2015.  

Liquidation
preference - Holdings   

The
holders of Series A and Series B preferred stock were entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any
of the assets or surplus funds of the Company to the holders of common stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, the amount
of $0.33, the original Series A issue price, and $0.45, the original Series B issue price, (in each case adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares) for each share of Series A and Series B preferred stock, respectively,
then held by them, and, in addition, an amount equal to all declared but unpaid dividends on Series A and Series B preferred stock,
respectively, held by them.  

If
the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of Series A and Series B preferred stock were insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of full aforesaid preferential amounts, then, subject to the rights of series of preferred stock that
may from time to time come into existence, the entire assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution were
to be distributed ratably among the holders of Series A and Series B preferred stock in the respective proportions which the aggregate
preferential amount of all shares of Series A and Series B preferred stock then held by each such holder bears to the aggregate
preferential amount of all shares of Series A and Series B preferred stock outstanding as of the date of the distribution upon
the occurrence of such liquidation event.  

After
payment had been made to the holders of preferred stock of the full amounts to which they were to be entitled as aforesaid, the
holders of Series A preferred stock, Series B preferred stock and common stock were to participate on a pro rata basis based on
the number of Common Stock equivalent shares held by a holder in the distribution of all remaining assets of the Company legally
available for distribution, with the outstanding shares of Series A and Series B preferred stock treated as though they had been
converted into the appropriate number of shares of Common Stock.

thereon, were repaid in full. The assets and liabilities of Koffee Korner were distributed in accordance with the terms of a spin-off
agreement on the closing date.  

The
share exchange transaction was treated as a reverse acquisition, with Holdings and Pharma as the acquirers and Koffee Korner and
Koffee Sub as the acquired parties. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when the Company refers to business and financial information
for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, the Company is referring to the business and financial information
of Holdings and Pharma. Under U.S. GAAP guidance ASC 805-40,  Business Combinations   Reverse Acquisitions , the Acquisition
has been treated as a reverse acquisition with no adjustment to the historical book and tax basis of the Company s assets
and liabilities.  

Preferred

8   STOCK OPTION PLANS (continued)  

Under
ASC No. 718, the Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted on each grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation
model and recognizes an expense ratably over the requisite service period. The range of fair value assumptions related to options
outstanding were as follows:  

The
expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatilities of publicly traded peer companies, determined by the Company,
and the historical volatility of the Company. The risk free interest rate used was based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity
rate in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the stock options to be valued. The expected dividend yield was zero,
as the Company does not anticipate paying a dividend within the relevant timeframe. Due to a lack of historical information needed
to estimate the Company s expected term, it was estimated using the simplified method allowed under ASC No. 718. In calculating
the number of options issued in lieu of pay during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used assumptions comparable
to December 31, 2015, with a 20-day weighted average stock price.  

As
part of the requirements of ASC No. 718, the Company is required to estimate potential forfeitures of stock grants and adjust
stock based compensation expense accordingly. The estimate of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period to
the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures will
be recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of stock based compensation expenses to be recognized in
future periods.  

The
Company recognized $5,917 and $362,646 in stock based compensation expense related to options during the three and nine-months
ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $206,959 and $1,169,538 in stock based compensation expense related to options during
the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Of these amounts, $0 and $227,784 were related to 0 and 3,796,385
options issued to employees in lieu of salaries accrued for services during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, and $138,462 and $669,007 were related to 477,456 and 3,738,958 options issued to employees in lieu of salaries
accrued for services during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. $0 and $66,445 were related to 0
and 1,107,417 options issued to consultants in lieu of fees accrued for services during the three and nine-months ended September
30, 2016, respectively, and $30,997 and $170,678 were related to 106,887 and 945,263 options issued to consultants in lieu of
fees accrued for services during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. $1,750 was related to 25,000
vested options issued to a consultant as compensation for services during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016,
and $0 was related to 0 options issued to consultants as compensation for services during the three and nine-months ended September
30, 2015. $4,167 and $66,667 were related to 27,778 and 1,069,445 options issued to directors as compensation for services during

Amounts
payable to this director was $293,546 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

NOTE
11   INCOME TAXES  

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities
and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected
to be reversed.  

The
effective tax rate for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, differs from the statutory rate of 34% as
a result of the state taxes (net of Federal benefit) and permanent differences.  

The
Company s valuation allowance was primarily related to the operating losses. The valuation allowance is determined in accordance
with the provisions of ASC No. 740,  Income Taxes , which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when
measuring the need for a valuation allowance. Based on the available objective evidence and the Company s history of losses,
management provides no assurance that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company has applied a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets net of the expected income from the reversal
of the deferred tax liabilities.  

The
Company is subject to taxation in the United States and two state jurisdictions. The preparation of tax returns requires management
to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid
by the Company. Management, in consultation with its tax advisors, files its tax returns based on interpretations that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances. The income tax returns, however, are subject to routine reviews by the various taxing
authorities. As part of these reviews, a taxing authority may disagree with respect to the tax positions taken by management ( uncertain
tax positions ) and therefore may require the Company to pay additional taxes.

NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE
11   INCOME TAXES (continued)  

Management
evaluates the requirement for additional tax accruals, including interest and penalties, which the Company could incur as a result
of the ultimate resolution of its uncertain tax positions. Management reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions
as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities, completion of tax audits, expiration of statute of limitations,
or upon occurrence of other events.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was no liability for income tax associated with unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as well as any related penalties in interest income
or expense in its consolidated statements of operations, which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting
periods.  

The
federal and state income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS and state taxing authorities, generally
for three years after they were filed.  

The
Company received a refundable tax credit of $0 and $47,802 from the state of Hawaii during the three and nine-months ended September
30, 2016, respectively. This amount is recorded as other income in the condensed, consolidated statement of operations.

Patent
payable   

As
part of the formation of the Company, a patent license was transferred to the Company. The original license began in 2006. Under
the terms of the license the Company agreed to pay $10,000 per year through 2015 and royalties of 2% on any revenues resulting
from the license. There were no revenues generated by this license during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. The remaining obligation of $20,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, is recorded as a part of accounts payable
on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The license expired in February 2016.  

Employee
settlement   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company owed a former employee a severance settlement payable in the amount of

Capsugel
agreement   

On
August 18, 2014, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Capsugel US, LLC ( Capsugel ) for the joint
commercial development of Astaxanthin products ( Capsugel Astaxanthin Products ) for the consumer health market that
contain nature-identical synthetic Astaxanthin and use Capsugel s proprietary formulation technology. The agreement provides
for the parties to jointly administer activities under a product development plan that will include identifying at least one mutually
acceptable third party marketer who will further develop, market and distribute Capsugel Astaxanthin Products. Capsugel will share
revenues with the Company based on net sales of products that are developed under the collaboration. No revenues were realized
from this agreement during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. In January 2016, the Company suspended
development of a Capsugel Astaxanthin Product, ASTX-1F, based on certain technical issues which, together with other business
and regulatory issues, materially impeded the formulation of ASTX-1F as a commercially viable product for the consumer health
market.

Explanatory
Note   

Unless
otherwise noted, references in this Form 10-Q to  Cardax,  the  Company,   we,   our 
or  us  means Cardax, Inc., the registrant, and, unless the context otherwise requires, together with its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Cardax Pharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (  Pharma  ), and Pharma s predecessor, Cardax
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (  Holdings  ), which merged with and into Cardax, Inc. on December
30, 2015.  

Corporate
Overview and History   

We
acquired Cardax Pharma, Inc. (  Pharma  ) and its life science business through the merger of Cardax Acquisition,
Inc. (  Cardax Sub  ), our wholly-owned transitory subsidiary (  Cardax Sub  ), with and into
Pharma on February 7, 2014 (the   Merger  ), and a stock purchase agreement. As a result of these transactions,
Pharma became our wholly-owned subsidiary. The only consideration that we paid under the stock purchase agreement and the Merger
was shares of our Common Stock. On May 31, 2013, Pharma acquired all of the assets and assumed all of the liabilities of Cardax
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (  Holdings  ). Accordingly, we have two predecessors: Pharma and Pharma s predecessor,
Holdings. Prior to the February 7, 2014 effective date of the Merger, we operated under the name  Koffee Korner Inc. 
and our business was limited to a single location retailer of specialty coffee located in Houston, Texas. On the effective date
of the Merger, we divested our coffee business and now exclusively continue Pharma s life sciences business. On December
30, 2015, our former principal stockholder, Holdings, merged with and into us (the  Holdings Merger ). There was not
any cash consideration exchanged in the Holdings Merger. Upon the closing of the Holdings Merger, the stockholders of Holdings
received an aggregate number of shares and warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock equal to the aggregate number of shares
of our Common Stock that were held by Holdings on the date of the closing of the Holdings Merger. Our restricted shares of Common
Stock held by Holdings were cancelled upon the closing of the Holdings Merger. Accordingly, there was not any change to our fully
diluted capitalization due to the Holdings Merger.  

We
are devoting substantially all of our present efforts to establishing our business related to the development and commercialization
of safe anti-inflammatory dietary supplements and drugs. The safety and efficacy of our products have not been directly evaluated
in clinical trials or confirmed by the FDA. On August 24, 2016, we launched our first commercial product, ZanthoSyn . ZanthoSyn 
is marketed as a novel astaxanthin dietary supplement with superior absorption and purity. We are using e-commerce as our primary
sales channel for ZanthoSyn . Astaxanthin is a clinically studied ingredient with safe anti-inflammatory activity that supports
joint health, cardiovascular health, metabolic health, and liver health. The form of astaxanthin utilized in ZanthoSyn 
has demonstrated excellent safety in peer-reviewed published studies and is designated as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe)
according to FDA regulations. Our ZanthoSyn  product manufacturing process relies on certain third-party suppliers and this
dependence creates several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality, and delivery schedules. In addition,
any supply interruption could materially harm our ability to manufacture ZanthoSyn  until a new source of supply is obtained
on acceptable terms. We may be unable to find such other sources in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms,
if at all, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a second generation
product, we are developing CDX-085, our patented astaxanthin derivative, which could reduce the size/number of capsules or tablets
required to achieve equivalent circulating levels of astaxanthin. We also plan to pursue pharmaceutical applications of astaxanthin
and related compounds.  

At
present we are not able to estimate if or when we will be able to generate sustained revenues. Our financial statements have been
prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern; however, given our recurring losses from operations, our independent
registered public accounting firm has determined there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  

Results
of Operations   

Results
of Operations for the Three-Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

The
following table reflects our operating results for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Operating
Summary for the Three-Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

We
launched our first commercial product on August 24, 2016. Revenues were $11,160 and $0 for the three-months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. We are using e-commerce as our primary sales channel and are leveraging our experience and relationships
in the scientific and medical community to market our product. We expect that our initial marketing program will continue to
focus on outreach to physicians, healthcare professionals, and consumers over the following several fiscal quarters. Cost
of goods sold was $5,717 and $0 for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and included costs of the
product, shipping and handling, sales taxes, and merchant fees. Gross profit was $5,443 for the three-months ended September 30,
2016, which represented a gross profit margin of 49%.  

Operating
expenses were $487,587 and $743,578 for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating expenses primarily
consisted of expenses for services provided to the Company, including payroll and consultation, for research and development,
administration, and sales and marketing. These expenses were paid in accordance with agreements entered into with each consultant,
employee, or service provider. Included in operating expenses were $116,583 and $256,959 in stock based compensation for the three-months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Other
income (expenses) were $(294) and $117 for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Operating
Summary for the Nine-months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

We
launched our first commercial product on August 24, 2016. Revenues were $11,160 and $0 for the nine-months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We are using e-commerce as our primary sales channel and are leveraging our experience and
relationships in the scientific and medical community to market our product. We expect that our initial marketing program
will continue to focus on outreach to physicians, healthcare professionals, and consumers over the following several fiscal
quarters. Cost of goods sold was $5,717 and $0 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and
included costs of the product, shipping and handling, sales taxes, and merchant fees. Gross profit was $5,443 for the
nine-months ended September 30, 2016, which represented a gross profit margin of 49%.  

Operating
expenses were $1,439,912 and $2,587,228 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating expenses
primarily consisted of expenses for services provided to the Company, including payroll and consultation, for research and development,
administration, and sales and marketing. These expenses were paid in accordance with agreements entered into with each consultant,
employee, or service provider. Included in operating expenses were $498,312 and $1,534,468 in stock based compensation for the
nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Other
income was $46,543 and $143,347 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the nine-months ended
September 30, 2016, other income primarily consisted of a State of Hawaii refundable research and development credit of $47,082.
For the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, other income primarily consisted of a reversal of estimated accrued liabilities
of $48,204 and a gain on the sale of assets of $95,000.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Since
our inception, we have sustained operating losses and have used cash raised by issuing securities in our operations. During the
nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we used cash in operating activities in the amount of $858,381 and $1,070,699 respectively,
and incurred a net loss of $1,387,926 and $2,443,881, respectively.  

We
require additional financing in order to continue to fund our operations, and pay existing and future liabilities and other obligations.
To conserve cash resources, we agreed with our employees, executives, and certain vendors to pay any compensation due during any
calendar quarter that has not been paid in cash in the form of shares of our common stock or stock options, as described in the
Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 7, 2015. On March 28, 2016, we furloughed all of our employees and independent contractors
indefinitely and arranged with our Chief Executive Officer, David G. Watumull; our Chief Financial Officer, John B. Russell; and
our Vice President, Operations, David M. Watumull, to continue their services for cash compensation equal to the minimum wage.
In addition, each of the directors agreed, effective April 1, 2016, to suspend any additional equity compensation, until otherwise
agreed by the Company. We also deferred payment of other trade payables. On June 3, 2016, the compensation arrangement of our
Vice President, Operations, David M. Watumull was amended so that, effective May 30, 2016, he would receive bi-weekly compensation
equal to $3,269 and the compensation arrangement of our Vice President, Research, Timothy J. King was amended so that, effective
May 30, 2016, he would receive bi-weekly compensation equal to $1,635. On September 6, 2016, the compensation arrangements of
certain officers were amended so that effective September 8, 2016, (i) our Chief Executive Officer, David G. Watumull would receive
bi-weekly compensation equal to $4,327, (ii) our Chief Science Officer, Gilbert M. Rishton would receive bi-weekly compensation
equal to $1,923, and (iii) our Vice President, Research, Timothy J. King would receive bi-weekly compensation equal to $3,269.
On September 6, 2016, the compensation arrangement with JBR Business Solutions, LLC, under which John B. Russell serves as our
Chief Financial Officer, was amended so that effective September 30, 2016, he would receive monthly compensation of $3,500. On
September 6, 2016, the compensation arrangements of the independent directors of the Company were amended so that effective September
30, 2016, they would each receive quarterly equity compensation of $12,500 in arrears in the form of a grant of shares of our
common stock or non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock under the Cardax, Inc. 2014
Equity Compensation Plan based on the higher of the then current market price or $0.15 per share, with such compensation prorated
for one of three months for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

It
is estimated that our limited available cash resources as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, would
be sufficient to continue operations on a limited budget only through December 31, 2016. In addition to the $985,000 raised
in the year-to-date, we intend to raise additional capital that would fund our operations through at least June 30, 2017. We
expect to be able to access capital during the fourth quarter under the previously reported equity purchase agreement, pursuant
to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell shares of our common stock, as described in our Current Report on
Form 8-K filed July 18, 2016. Our right to sell shares under this equity purchase agreement is subject to registering such shares
under the Securities Act as described in the Current Report and provides us with certain protections as described in the Current
Report that should result in financing with less dilution than our private placements of securities during 2016. Prior to accessing
capital under the equity purchase agreement, we may continue to obtain additional financing from investors through
the private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock. Any financing transaction could also,
or in the alternative, include the issuance of our debt or convertible debt securities. There can be no assurance that a financing
transaction would be available to us on terms and conditions that we determined are acceptable.  

We
cannot give any assurance that we will in the future be able to achieve a level of profitability from the sale of existing or
future products or otherwise to sustain our operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.  

Any
inability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms will materially and adversely affect us, including requiring us to
significantly further curtail or cease business operations altogether.  

Our
working capital and capital requirements at any given time depend upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to:  

the
    progress of research and development programs;   

the
    level of resources that we devote to the development of our technologies, patents, marketing and sales capabilities; and   

revenues
    from the sale of any products or license revenues and the cost of any production or other operating expenses.   

The
following is a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities during the periods
indicated:  

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities   

During
the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our operating activities primarily consisted of payments or accruals for employees,
directors, and consultants for services related to research and development, administration, and sales and marketing.  

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities   

During
the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, and our investing activities were primarily related to expenditures on patents. During
the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, our investing activities were primarily related to proceeds from the sale of equipment
and expenditures on patents.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities   

During
the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, our financing activities consisted of transactions in which we raised proceeds through
the issuance of our Common Stock. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, our financing activities consisted of various
transactions in which we raised proceeds through the issuance of debt and our Common Stock. Because of the nature of our business,
capital is required to support research and development costs, as well as, our normal operating costs.  

Our
existing liquidity is not sufficient to fund our operations, anticipated capital expenditures, working capital and other financing
requirements for the foreseeable future. We will need to seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing, especially if we
experience downturns or cyclical fluctuations in our business that are more severe or longer than anticipated, or if we experience
significant increases in the cost of components and manufacturing, or increases in our expense levels resulting from being a publicly-traded
company. If we attempt to obtain additional debt or equity financing, we cannot assure you that such financing will be available
to us on favorable terms, or at all.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rule 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (b) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of the our management and directors; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2016.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.
However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to
time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.

by and between the Company and investors (each a   Purchaser   and collectively, the   Purchasers  )
pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers units (each a   Unit   and collectively the   Units  )
consisting of shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock.  

In the calendar year through
November 14, 2016, the Company sold an aggregate of 12,312,500 Units for an aggregate purchase price of $985,000.
The Company last reported sales of its securities in its Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed October 11, 2016. From and after
October 11, 2016 through November 14, 2016, the Company sold 2,312,500 Units for an aggregate purchase price of $185,000. 

Each
