NOTE 1. GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS

The Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on
February  25,  2013.  The Company is devoting  substantially  all of its present
efforts to establish a new business,  and has had no revenues from operations to
date.

Initial operations have included organization and capital formation.  Management
also has recently  developed  electronic  medical  record  software for small to
medium  sized  physician  offices  and  clinics,  and is  planning  to market it
commercially when they can successfully raise the financing to do so.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING BASIS
The accounting and reporting  policies of the Company conform to U.S.  generally
accepted accounting  principles.  In the opinion of management,  all adjustments
considered  necessary for fair  presentation have been included in the financial
statements.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The financial  statements  of the Company have been  prepared  using the accrual
basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles
in the United States of America and are presented in U.S.  dollars.  The Company
has adopted a March 31 fiscal year end.

DIVIDENDS
The Company has not yet adopted any policy  regarding  payment of dividends.  No
dividends have been paid during the periods shown.

CASH
The  Company's  cash  consists of funds  deposited  with its lawyer into the law
firm's trust account.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                               September 30, 2016
                                   (unaudited)

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

EARNINGS PER SHARE
The basic earnings  (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net
income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares during the year. The diluted  earnings  (loss) per share is calculated by
dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the
diluted  weighted  average  number of shares  outstanding  during the year.  The
diluted  weighted  average  number of shares  outstanding  is the basic weighted
number  of  shares  adjusted  as of the  first of the  year for any  potentially
dilutive  debt or equity.  The Company has not issued any options or warrants or
similar securities since inception.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Company has adopted the US dollar as its functional  and reporting  currency
because most of its transactions are denominated in US currency.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The  Company  estimates  the  fair  value of  financial  instruments  using  the
available market  information and valuation  methods.  Considerable  judgment is
required in estimating fair value. Accordingly,  the estimates of fair value may
not be indicative  of the amounts the Company could realize in a current  market
exchange.

INCOME TAXES
A deferred  tax asset or liability  is recorded  for all  temporary  differences
between  financial  and tax  reporting  and net  operating  loss  carryforwards.
Deferred tax expense  (benefit)  results from the net change  during the year of
deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of the deferred
tax  assets,  will not be  realized.  Deferred  tax assets and  liabilities  are
adjusted  for the  effects  of  changes  in tax  laws  and  rates on the date of
enactment.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                               September 30, 2016
                                   (unaudited)

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company will recognize revenue when products are fully delivered or services
have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The  Company  does  not  expect  the  adoption  of  recently  issued  accounting
pronouncements  to  have a  significant  impact  on  the  Company's  results  of
operations, financial position or cash flow.

NOTE 3. GOING CONCERN

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been  prepared  assuming that the
Company  will  continue  as a going  concern,  which  contemplates,  among other
things,  the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. The Company has net losses from the date of incorporation on
February 25, 2013 to September  30, 2016 of $97,502.  The ability of the Company
to  continue  as a going  concern is  dependent  upon the  Company's  successful
efforts to either generate revenues or raise sufficient capital for its business
plans and then  attain  profitable  operations.  In  response  to these  issues,
management has planned the following actions:

     -    The Company intends to fund its  expenditures  through loans or equity
          financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its proposed
          development expenditures,  working capital and other cash requirements
          through the next fiscal year.

     -    Management  is  currently   formulating  plans  to  develop  and  sell
          electronic medical records software to generate future revenues. There
          can be no  assurances,  however,  that  management's  expectations  of
          future revenues will be realized.

                                   ZLATO INC.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                               September 30, 2016
                                   (unaudited)

NOTE 3. GOING CONCERN (CONTINUED)

Management  estimates  the minimum  amount of  additional  funding  necessary to
enable the Company to carry out its intended business plan and remain viable for
at least the twelve months  following  the date of the  financial  statements is
approximately  $50,000.  These factors,  among others,  raise  substantial doubt
about the  Company's  ability to continue as a going  concern.  These  financial
statements do not include any adjustments  that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.

NOTE 4. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

AUTHORIZED

The Company is authorized to issue 75,000,000  shares of $0.001 par value common
stock. All common stock shares have equal voting rights,  are non-assessable and
have one vote per share.  Voting rights are not cumulative and,  therefore,  the
holders of more than 50% of the common  stock  could,  if they  choose to do so,
elect all of the directors of the Company.

ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING

On February 25, 2013  (inception),  the Company issued  5,000,000  shares of its
common  shares to its  President,  Secretary  Treasurer and Director for cash of
$.003 per share or$15,000 in aggregate.  See Note 5. On September 30 and October
31, 2013 the Company accepted  subscriptions  under its registered  offering for
1,000,000  shares  of common  stock  for cash of $0.05  per  share or  aggregate
proceeds of $50,000.

NOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company's officer and director is involved in other business  activities and
may,  in the  future,  become  involved in other  business  opportunities.  If a
specific  business  opportunity  becomes  available,  such  persons  may  face a
conflict in selecting  between the Company and their other  business  interests.
The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts.

On February 25, 2013, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of its common stock to
its President, Secretary Treasurer and Director for cash of $15,000. See Note 4.

During the six months  ended  September  30,  2016,  the Director of the Company
advanced  $8,072 to the Company to pay expenses on behalf of the Company.  Total
advances to September 30, 2016 are $29,658.  The advances bear no interest,  are
unsecured, and due on demand.

                                   (unaudited)

NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES

Net deferred tax assets are $0.  Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon  sufficient  future  taxable  income  during  the  period  that  deductible
temporary  differences and carry-forwards are expected to be available to reduce
taxable  income.  As the  achievement  of  required  future  taxable  income  is
uncertain, the Company recorded a 100% valuation allowance.  Management believes
it is likely that any deferred tax assets will not be realized.

                                            March 31, 2016      March 31, 2015

The accumulated net losses to March 31, 2016 before taxes are $89,504, resulting
in an aggregate deferred tax asset/recovery of $31,326. The Company has recorded
a 100% valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realization.

The Company's aggregate net operating losses of $89,504 expire as follows:

        March 31, 2034 -     50,947

We completed a registered  offering and raised $50,000 in 2014, which we used to
complete  development  of our  basic  EMR  software  and for the  launch  of our
website.  You can view the website and register to view and use our EMR software
at www.zlatoinc.com.

Our basic EMR software  collects and captures patient data  electronically,  and
stores  it  in  a  format  that  enables  efficient  access  and  viewing,   and
distribution by printing or email. Our planned second phase product  development
will focus on  interconnectivity  of our EMR software  with various  third party
vital signs monitors, such as blood pressure monitors or temperature monitors.

We currently have no revenues,  no operating  history,  and no users or revenues
for our  software.  We  currently  have little  cash and a net  working  capital
deficit.  Therefore,  our  business  will fail  without  immediate  funding.  We
currently  estimate that we will need an additional  $10-15,000 just to maintain
our corporate  existence and meet our regulatory  requirements  over the next 12
months.  Our director  has  indicated  that she will fund our  existing  working
capital deficit and minimum required  expenditures the next quarter with a loan,
but there are no arrangements thereafter.

We  cannot  guarantee  we will be  successful  in doing so or with  planned  our
business operations. Our business is subject to all of the risks inherent in the
establishment of a new business enterprise and revenue generation from our basic
EMR software product is dependent on additional financing as noted herein.

GOING CONCERN

We have very limited  operations and no revenues.  We have incurred  losses from
operations  since inception.  No revenues are anticipated  until we complete and
successfully  commercialize our planned EMR software. The ability of our Company
to  continue  as a going  concern is  dependent  on raising  capital to fund our
business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these
factors raise  substantial  doubt as to the  Company's  ability to continue as a
going concern.

Our   activities  to  date  have  been  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  share
subscriptions and a loan from our director. From our inception to the present we
have raised a total of $65,000 in gross proceeds from the issuance of our common
stock.  Our director  also lent us $29,658 in aggregate for our  operations.  We
require significant  additional  financing to develop our business.  There is no
guarantee that we will be able to raise any additional funds.

                                       11
 
12 MONTH PLAN OF OPERATION

We cannot  guarantee  we will be  successful  in our  business  operations.  Our
business is subject to all of the risks inherent in the  establishment  of a new
business  enterprise  and we are a number of months  away  from  generating  any
revenue, if at all.

Our plan of operations  over the next 12 month period is focused  exclusively on
raising  additional  capital for our survival and the  commercial  launch of our
basic EMR software and development of an  interoperability  kit with third party
monitoring  equipment.  We currently have little cash and a net working  capital
deficit.  Therefore,  our  business  will fail  without  immediate  capital.  We
currently  estimate that we will need an additional  $10-15,000 just to maintain
our corporate  existence and meet our regulatory  requirements  over the next 12
months.  Our director has indicated that she will only fund our existing working
capital  deficit and minimum  required  expenditures  for the next quarter,  and
there are no arrangements  thereafter.  We currently estimate we will require an
additional  $200,000  for the  commercial  launch of our basic EMR  software and
another  8-10  months and $50,000 to develop the  software  development  kit for
interoperability  with third parties.  We do not have any  arrangements in place
for this additional financing.

Our  commercial  launch  budget  also  includes  approximately  $20,000  for the
development of an automated  software  deployment system which will enable us to
either run the software for licensed users on our servers,  or sell our software
to clients via the internet. Fixes and updates should be easily deployed through
this system, ensuring that all of our clients are running on the latest version.
We also plan to hire a contract  sales  consultant  at a monthly cost of $3,000.
His or her initial  responsibilities will focus on the selection of several beta
test clients to test our software prior to commercial sale.

Ms. Gallovicova is responsible for all financing activities,  and developing all
job  specifications  for our third party contract software  developers or firms.
She will also be responsible for hiring the sales  consultant,  and will oversee
the sales  consultant  in their  role  specifically  as beta test  subjects  are
selected and the marketing plan is developed.

Without additional financing on a timely basis, our business will fail.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We  incurred  a loss of $3,828  and $3,044  for the three  month  periods  ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.  This three month loss includes $1,763
for general and  administrative  costs (2015 - $979) and $2,065  (2015 - $2,065)
for professional fees.

We  incurred  a loss of  $7,998  and  $7,994  for the six  month  periods  ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015  respectively.  This six month loss includes  $2,168
for general and administrative  costs (2015 - $2,164) and $5,830 (2015 - $5,830)
for professional fees.

From  inception  on February  25, 2013 to  September  30, 2016 we have  incurred
cumulative  losses of $97,502.  We believe we will continue to incur losses into
the foreseeable future as we develop our business.

REVENUES

We have not generated any revenues since February 25, 2013  (inception).  Future
revenue  generation  is  dependent  on  obtaining  the  necessary  financing  to
commercially launch our product.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Historically, we have financed our cash flow and operations solely from the sale
of $65,000 of common stock.  Our director has also lent our Company  $29,658 for
working  capital  purposes.  The loan  does not bear  interest  and there are no
specified  repayment  terms.  She has indicated that she will not seek repayment

                                       12
 
until we have  sufficient  resources  to do so. All of the funds we have  raised
were used for operating  activities since our inception on February 25, 2013. As
of September 30, 2016,  our resultant  cash balance was $145 and our net working
capital deficit was $32,502.

We  currently do not have the cash  resources  to continue  with our business or
maintain  our  existence.  Our  director  has  indicated  that she will fund the
estimated  cash  shortfall  for the  next  quarter,  but  there  are no  further
arrangements  in place.  We must also raise  significant  additional  funding to
launch our EMR product and develop interoperability.

These funds will have to be raised through equity financing,  debt financing, or
other sources,  which may result in the dilution in the equity  ownership of our
shares.  We will  also need more  funds if the  costs of  commercialization  and
further  development  are greater  than we have  budgeted.  We will also require
additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are ultimately not
successful in earning  revenues.  We currently do not have any  arrangements  in
place  regarding  our current  offering or any  subsequent  offering for further
financing and we may not be able to obtain  financing when  required.  Obtaining
commercial  loans,  assuming  those loans would be available,  will increase our
liabilities and future cash commitments.

There are no assurances  that we will be able to obtain  further funds  required
for our continued operations.  Even if additional financing is available, it may
not be  available  on  terms  we find  favorable.  At this  time,  there  are no
anticipated  sources of additional funds in place.  Failure to secure the needed
additional  financing  will have an adverse  effect on our  ability to remain in
business.
