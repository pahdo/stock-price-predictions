   1.                   BASIS OF PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION  
     
  Allied Motion Technologies Inc. (Allied Motion or the Company) is engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing and selling motion control solutions, which include integrated system solutions as well as individual motion control products, to a broad spectrum of customers throughout the world primarily for the commercial motor, industrial motion, automotive control, medical, and aerospace and defense markets.  
     
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
     
  The assets and liabilities of the Company s international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using end of period exchange rates.  Changes in reported amounts of assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries that occur as a result of changes in exchange rates between international subsidiaries  functional currencies and the U.S. dollar are included in foreign currency translation adjustment.  Foreign currency translation adjustment is included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders  equity in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  Revenue and expense transactions use an average rate prevailing during the month of the related transaction.  Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of each Technology Unit ( TU ) are included in the results of operations as incurred.  
     
  The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and include all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  The Company believes that the disclosures herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  The financial data for the interim periods may not necessarily be indicative of results to be expected for the year.  
     
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions.  Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
     
  It is suggested that the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to such statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 that was previously filed by the Company.  
     
    Reclassifications    
     
  Certain items in the prior year s consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.  
     
   2.                   ACQUISITION  
     
    Acquisition of Heidrive    
     
  In December 2015, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Allied Motion Technologies B.V., entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) to purchase all of the outstanding equity interests of Heidrive GmbH, a German limited liability company ( Heidrive ) from palero f nf S.  r.l for $22,000 (approximately  20,000), which included certain management performance bonuses to be paid after closing.  
     
  The adjusted purchase price as of January 12, 2016 is $18,378 ( 16,924).  At the end of the first quarter, the adjusted purchase price was $19,329 ( 17,800). During the second quarter, the purchase price was reduced by $951 ( 876) for a seller concession that was finalized.  There were no adjustments to the purchase price during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

  ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC.  
  UNAUDITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  (In thousands, except share and per share data)  
     
  The purchase price was funded with cash of $7,519 ($8,470 less the Seller concession of $951, or  6,924) plus $10,859 ( 10,000) of borrowings under the Company s international revolving credit facility (Note 9).  
     
  Heidrive is headquartered in Kelheim, Germany, and has manufacturing facilities located in Germany and the Czech Republic.  
     
  The Company incurred $467 of transaction costs in 2015 and $135 in 2016 related to the acquisition of Heidrive.  Transaction costs are included in Business Development expenses on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.  
     
  The purchase price was allocated to the underlying net assets based on fair value as of the acquisition date, as follows (in thousands):  

The purchase price allocation has been revised to reflect an updated valuation of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.  The purchase price allocation may be subject to further adjustment to reflect, among other things, any adjustments to income taxes and the offsetting adjustments to goodwill .  
     
  The intangible assets acquired consist of customer lists, tradename, and technology.  Goodwill generated in the acquisition is related to the assembled workforce, synergies between Allied Motion s other Technology Units ( TUs ) that will occur as a result of the combined engineering knowledge, the ability of each of the TUs to integrate each other s products into more fully integrated system solutions and Allied Motion s ability to utilize Heidrive s management knowledge in providing complementary product offerings to the Company s customers.  
     
   3.                   INVENTORIES  
     
  Inventories include costs of materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market, as follows (in thousands):

9.                   DEBT OBLIGATIONS  
     
  On October 28, 2016, the Company entered into a new $125,000 Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility that replaces the Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (as amended, the  Prior Credit Agreement ) and Senior Subordinated Notes.  Refer to Note 18. Subsequent Event for information.  
     
  Debt obligations consisted of the following (in thousands):  

(1)  The effective rate of the Term Loan including the impact of the related hedges is 2.82%.  
     
   Prior Credit Agreement   
     
  On January 8, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment and Consent (the  Amendment ) to the Prior Credit Agreement.  Pursuant to the Amendment, the administrative agent and lenders consented to the Company s acquisition of Heidrive GmbH, and that such acquisition would not reduce the acquisition basket under the Prior Credit Agreement.  The Amendment also amended the Prior Credit Agreement to increase the revolving credit facility from $15,000 to $30,000 and the international revolving sublimit from $10,000 to $25,000.  
     
  The Prior Credit Agreement included a $30,000 Revolving Credit Facility and a $50,000 Term Loan (collectively the  Senior Credit Facilities ) each with a five year term that were scheduled to mature in 2018.  
     
  Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities were subject to terms defined in the Prior Credit Agreement.  Borrowings bear interest at either the Base Rate plus a margin of 0.25% to 2.00% (currently 1.50%) or the Eurocurrency Rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 3.00% (currently 2.00%), in each case depending on the Company s ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (the  Total Leverage Ratio ).  
     
  Principal installments were scheduled to be payable on the Term Loan in varying percentages quarterly through September 30, 2018 with a

  balloon payment at maturity.  The Senior Credit Facilities were secured by substantially all of the Company s assets.  The average outstanding borrowings for 2016 for the Senior Credit Facilities were $45,000.  At September 30, 2016, there was approximately $22,800 available under the Senior Credit Facilities.  These amounts reflect the face value of the borrowings without adjustment for unamortized debt issue costs.  
     
  The Prior Credit Agreement included certain financial covenants related to maximum leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage.  The Prior Credit Agreement also included other covenants and restrictions, including limits on the amount of certain types of capital expenditures.  The Company was in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2016.  
     
   Senior Subordinated Notes   
     
  Under the Company s Note Agreement, the Company sold $30,000 of 14.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due October 18, 2019 (the  Notes ) to Prudential Capital Partners IV, L.P. and its affiliates in a private placement.  The interest rate on the Notes was 14.50% with 13.00% payable in cash and 1.50% payable in-kind, quarterly in arrears and the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest was scheduled to be due on October 18, 2019.  The Company was permitted to prepay the Notes at any time after October 18, 2016, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount.  The Notes were unsecured obligations of the Company and were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Company s subsidiaries.  
     
  On January 8, 2016, the Company entered into a Consent and Amendment No. 3 to the Note Agreement with Prudential Capital Partners IV, L.P. and its affiliates.  Pursuant to the Note Amendment, the note holders consented to the Company s acquisition of Heidrive GmbH and that such acquisition would not reduce the acquisition basket under the Note Agreement.

  The China Facility provides credit of approximately $1,800 (Chinese Renminbi ( RMB ) 12,000).  The China Facility is used for working capital and capital equipment needs at the Company s China operations, and will mature in November, 2017.  The average balance for 2016 was $1,600 (RMB 10,500).  At September 30, 2016, there was approximately $235 (RMB 1,570) available under the facility.  
     
  Maturities of long-term debt as of September 30, 2016 were as follows:  

10.            DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  
     
  The Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.  The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities.  The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments.  Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company s investments and borrowings.  
     
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements

  without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  During October 2013, the Company entered into two Interest Rate Swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 (representing 50% of the Term Loan balance at that time) that amortize quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at maturity.  The notional amount changes over time as loan payments are made.  As of September 30, 2016, the amount hedged was $15,750.  
     
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  During 2016 and 2015, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt.  The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.  There was no hedge ineffectiveness recorded in the Company s earnings during the quarters or nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
  Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate debt.  The Company estimates that an additional $62 will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense over the next year.  
     
  Additionally, the Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges.  
     
  The tables below present the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):  

The effect of the Company s derivative financial instruments on the condensed consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income is as follows (in thousands):

   11.                                    FAIR VALUE  
     
  Authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  
     
  The guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value which utilizes observable and unobservable inputs.  Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.  Preference is given to observable inputs.  
     
  These two types of inputs create the following three-level fair value hierarchy:  

Level 1:       
 
  Quoted prices for identical assets or   liabilities in active markets.           

Level 2:       
 
  Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities   in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or   liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations   whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable.           

Level 3:

  The Company s financial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, debt obligations, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.  The carrying amounts reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for these assets approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments.  
     
  The following table presents the Company s financial assets that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):  

12.            INCOME TAXES  
     
  The income tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of the annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period.  Each quarter, the estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if the estimated effective tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made.  There is a potential for volatility of the effective tax rate due to several factors, including changes in the mix of the pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates, changes in tax laws and international tax holidays, settlements with taxing authorities and foreign currency fluctuations.

  The Company has net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain international jurisdictions expiring through 2017.  The Company evaluates the future realizability of the tax loss and credit carryforwards considering the anticipated future earnings and tax planning strategies in the international jurisdictions.  
     
  The effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes was 29.9% and 24.2% for the third quarter 2016 and 2015, respectively and 31.5% and 27.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The effective tax rate for 2016 contains discrete items for tax return to accrual and other adjustments and the adoption of ASU 2016-09.  The effective rate before discrete item for 2016 and 2015 varies from the statutory rate due to permanent differences, state taxes and the difference in US and international tax rates and the mix of international and domestic income.  
     
  The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 prospectively and ASU 2015-17 retrospectively as of January 1, 2016.  These pronouncements impact the accounting and disclosure for income taxes (refer to Note 17).

   16.            SEGMENT INFORMATION  
     
  ASC Topic  Segment Reporting  requires disclosure of operating segments, which as defined, are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  
     
  The Company operates in one segment for the manufacture and marketing of motion control products for original equipment manufacturers and end user applications.  In accordance with the  Segment Reporting  Topic of the ASC, the Company s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company.  Existing guidance, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue.  All material operating units qualify for aggregation under  Segment Reporting  due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes.  Since the Company operates in one segment, all financial information required by  Segment Reporting  can be found in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and within this note.  
     
  The Company s wholly owned international subsidiaries, located in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Portugal, China and Mexico are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
  Financial information related to the international subsidiaries is summarized below (in thousands):  

Identifiable international assets were $78,620 and $56,444 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
     
  Revenues derived from international subsidiaries and identifiable assets outside of the United States are primarily attributable to Europe.  
     
  Sales to customers outside of the United States by all subsidiaries were $26,670 and $20,755 during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and $84,903 and $62,283 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  For third quarter 2016 and 2015, one customer accounted for 24% and 26% of revenues, respectively; and for the year to date 2016 and 2015 for 20% and 24%, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, this customer represented 14% and 18% of trade receivables, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, one other customer represented 10% and 19% of trade receivables, respectively.

   17.            RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
     
    Recently adopted accounting pronouncements    
     
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718).    The FASB issued ASU 2016-09 in March 2016 as part of its simplification initiative and affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The amendments in this update cover such areas as the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, an accounting policy election for forfeitures, the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for annual periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 using either prospective, retrospective or modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered in this update. As permitted within the amendment, the Company elected to early adopt and prospectively apply the provisions of this amendment as of January 1, 2016.  As a result of the adoption, a tax benefit of $160 was recorded in the first quarter.  
     
  Effective April 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.    Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position.  The Update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.  We early adopted this ASU for the first quarter of 2016, and we applied it retrospectively to 2015 for comparability, which resulted in the reclassification of $3,318 and $2,551 of current deferred tax assets to noncurrent as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  Effective January 1, 2016 the Company adopted ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments .   This standard requires that an entity recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The update requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  ASU 2015-16 did not have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   on a retrospective basis.  The updated accounting guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability instead of the historical presentation as an unamortized debt issuance asset.  The impacts of adopting the new standard as of December 31, 2015, were a decrease in other assets and a decrease in long term debt of $1,388.  
     
    Recently issued accounting pronouncements    
     
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   The objective of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce existing diversity in practice by addressing eight specific cash flow issues related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. If early adopted, an entity must adopt all the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on the Company s financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and creates Topic 842,   Leases .   The new topic supersedes Topic 840,   Leases ,  and increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires disclosures of key information about leasing arrangements.  The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method.  The Company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory .   The standard applies to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost.  An entity should measure inventory within the scope of the standard at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the

  ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.  The amendments in ASU 2015-11 more closely align the measurement of inventory in U.S. GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   which amended revenue recognition guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.  The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.  This accounting guidance will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 using one of two prescribed retrospective methods.  Early adoption is not permitted.  The Company has not yet selected a transition method, or determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.  
     
   18.            SUBSEQUENT EVENT  
     
   Revolving Facility   
     
  On October 28, 2016 the Company closed on a new $125,000 Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (Revolving Facility).  
     
  See Item 5. Other Information of Part II of this Form 10-Q for information regarding the Revolving Facility.  
     
  The initial proceeds from the Revolving Facility were used to redeem the Company s $30,000 of 14.50% Senior Subordinated Notes and the outstanding amounts under the Prior Credit Agreement of $40,531 at October 28, 2016 (see Note 9. Debt Obligations a for description of the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Prior Credit Agreement).  
     
  The termination of the Credit Agreement and Senior Subordinated Notes will result in a $1,000 write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs in the fourth quarter of 2016.

We sell component and integrated motion control solutions to end customers and original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) through our own direct sales force and authorized manufacturers  representatives and distributors.  Our products include brush and brushless DC motors, brushless servo and torque motors, coreless DC motors, integrated brushless motor-drives, gearmotors, gearing, modular digital servo drives, motion controllers, incremental and absolute optical encoders, and other motion control-related products.  
     
   Financial overview   
     
  The Company s sales for the third quarter of 2016 were flat compared to the prior year.  Our market position in our medical and aerospace and defense markets has grown with the addition of Heidrive to our Company portfolio.  While our vehicle market was relatively stable sequentially, specific applications in that market are challenged, and we are expecting that to persist over the short term.  We are addressing the effects of our customer concentration and end of life product cycles by taking a long term strategic view as we review and adjust our operations and cost structure accordingly.  Earnings were $1,800 lower in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year which reflects higher operating costs from increased investment in engineering and development for multi-product motion system offerings, the additional expense related to the

Table of Contents   
     
  Heidrive acquisition and the investments we continue to make for our One Allied team as we realign our organization for greater efficiency and accelerated growth.  
     
  The softness in the off road vehicle industry combined with certain customer challenges is unfortunately masking successes with new application wins we have experienced in 2016.  We also continue to make excellent progress in our strategic market based multi-product development solutions which are being well received by our customers during the early stages of the product release cycle.  
     
  We continue to take a long-term view of our business and believe that our infrastructure changes and the collaborative organization we are building to advance our multi-product solutions offering is working.  We are confident that our strategy to be a unique, leading supplier of complete precision motion solutions to our target markets will enable us to take market share and gain greater scale over the next five years.  
     
   Operating Results   
     
    Quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to quarter ended September 30, 2015    

NET INCOME:  Net income decreased during the third quarter resulting from sales mix combined with increased investment in our One Allied team including selling expenses, and new product development costs.  Heidrive is included in our results as of January 12, 2016.

  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA:  EBITDA was $7,559 for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $9,033 for the same quarter last year.  Adjusted EBITDA was $8,077 and $9,443 for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measurements.  EBITDA consists of income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.  Adjusted EBITDA also excludes stock compensation expense and certain other items.  Refer to information included in  Non - GAAP Measures  below for a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.  
     
  REVENUES:  For the quarter, we had increases in all our markets outside of our vehicle market.  We had a decrease in sales resulting from challenges with specific applications within our vehicle market.  
     
  Sales to U.S. customers were 56% of total sales for the third quarter compared with 66% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.  
     
  ORDER BACKLOG:  The increase in bookings in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 is largely due to market growth, particularly in our medical and aerospace and defense markets.  The backlog increase as of September 30, 2016, compared to at December 31, 2015 was also attributable to market growth.  
     
  GROSS MARGIN:  The 7% gross margin decrease in third quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2015 was largely due to sales mix favoring lower margin products in 2016 along with under absorption of certain fixed production costs.  
     
  SELLING EXPENSES:  Selling expenses increased in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 primarily due the acquisition of Heidrive along with investment in our One Allied sales organization.  Selling expenses as a percentage of revenues were 4% and 3% in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES:  General and administrative expenses decreased 9% in the third quarter 2016 from the third quarter 2015 largely due to the reduction in incentive compensation accruals reflecting the decrease in net income for the quarter.  As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 9% for the period ended September 30, 2016 compared to 10% for the same period in 2015.  
     
  ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES:  Engineering and development expenses increased by 18% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter last year.  The increase is due to the ramp up of a significant development project to meet the future needs of a target market for Allied Motion and the acquisition of Heidrive.  As a percentage of revenues, engineering and development expenses were 7% and 5% for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, reflectively.  
     
  BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COSTS:  The Company incurred $123 of business development costs during the third quarter of 2016 related to the research of potential targets.  Business development costs are typically acquisition related expenses for due diligence and legal services as well as consulting expenses to evaluate new opportunities.  
     
  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS:  Amortization of intangible assets increased in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to the amortization of Heidrive intangible assets.  
     
  INCOME TAXES:  The effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes was 29.9% and 24.2% for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The effective tax rate for the third quarter 2016 contains a discrete tax provision for tax return to accrual and other adjustments of 6.9% or $248.  The effective rate before discrete item for 2016 and 2015 varies from the statutory rate due to permanent differences, state taxes and the difference in US and international tax rates and the mix of international and domestic income.  
     
  The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 prospectively and ASU 2015-17 retrospectively as of January 1, 2016.  These pronouncements impact the accounting and disclosure for income taxes (refer to Note 17).

    Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015    

NET INCOME:  Net income decreased during 2016 reflecting the sales mix in 2016, along with increased development costs, selling expenses and additional organizational enhancements.  
     
  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA:  EBITDA was $23,019 for 2016 compared to $24,349 last year.  Adjusted EBITDA was $23,907 and $25,685 for 2016 and 2015, respectively.  EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measurements.  EBITDA consists of income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.  Adjusted EBITDA also excludes stock compensation expense and certain other items.  Refer to information included in  Non - GAAP Measures  below for a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.  
     
  REVENUES:  For 2016, the increase in revenues reflects increased sales in all our markets except for our vehicle market.  
     
  Sales to U.S. customers were 55% of total sales for 2016 compared with 66% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.  
     
  ORDER BACKLOG:  The increase in bookings in 2016 compared to 2015 is largely due to addition of Heidrive.  On a sequential basis over the year there has been a decline in orders and backlog reflecting the weakness in our vehicle market, generally soft industrial market conditions, and seasonality in our European markets.  
     
  GROSS MARGIN:  The 2% increase in gross margin in 2016 compared to 2015 was largely due to the increase in volume attributable to market growth.

  SELLING EXPENSES:  Selling expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of Heidrive and continued investment in our One Allied sales organization to support future growth.  Selling expenses as a percentage of revenues were 4% for 2016 and 3% for 2015.  
     
  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES:  General and administrative expenses increased slightly in 2016 from 2015 largely due to the acquisition of Heidrive, partially offset by insurance recoveries related to a fire at one of our international locations and reductions in our incentive compensation accruals.  As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses was 9% and 10% for 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES:  Engineering and development expenses increased by 16% in 2016 compared to 2015.  The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of Heidrive and the ramp up of a significant development project to meet the future needs of a target market for Allied Motion.  As a percentage of revenues, engineering and development expenses were 6% for both 2016 and 2015.  
     
  BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COSTS:  The Company incurred $341 of business development costs during 2016 related to the acquisition of Heidrive on January 12, 2016 and consulting expenses to evaluate new business opportunities.  
     
  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS:  Amortization of intangible assets increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the amortization of Heidrive intangible assets.  
     
  INCOME TAXES:  The effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes was 31.5% and 27.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 contains a discrete tax provision of 0.9% or $95 including the return to accrual and other adjustments net of tax benefits related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09.  The effective rate before discrete item for 2016 and 2015 varies from the statutory rate due to permanent differences, state taxes and the difference in US and international tax rates and the mix of international and domestic income.  
     
  The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 prospectively and ASU 2015-17 retrospectively as of January 1, 2016.  These pronouncements impact the accounting and disclosure for income taxes (refer to Note 17).  
     
   Non-GAAP Measures   
     
  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP.  
     
  Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results; in particular, those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, and that are not a helpful measure of the performance of our underlying business particularly in light of their unpredictable nature.  This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company s results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.  In addition, supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Company s future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to net income determined in accordance with GAAP.  
     
  The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Company s management to measure the operating performance of the Company s business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense. EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the Company s industry.  
     
  The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business.  Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock compensation expense, as well as certain income or expenses which are not indicative of the ongoing performance of the Company.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure

  for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  
     
  The Company s calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands):  

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  On October 28, 2016, the Company entered into a new $125,000 Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility that replaces the Prior Credit Agreement and Senior Subordinated Notes.  Refer to Item 5. Other Information in Part II and Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 18. Subsequent Event in Part I for information.  
     
  The Company s liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents decreased by $8,736 to a balance of $12,542 at September 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015.  

During 2016, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to lower net income combined with an increase in working capital needs, primarily trade receivables and accrued liabilities that includes reduced incentive compensation.  The receivables increase reflects higher sales in 2016 compared to 2015.  
     
  The significant cash used for investing activities in 2016 reflects the acquisition of Heidrive during the first quarter.  The cash paid for the acquisition was $16,049 net of cash acquired.  During 2016, purchases of property and equipment were comparable at $3,694 and $3,693 for 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  Net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 compared to net cash used in 2015 reflects the use of the international revolver of $10,859 ( 10,000) to partially finance the Heidrive acquisition in the first quarter.  During 2016, we made payments of $5,333 ( 4,500) towards the international revolver.  Net borrowings of $1,000 have been made in 2016 on the US revolver.  
     
  We have made $5,625 of payments in the first nine months of 2016 for our Term Loan obligation.  At September 30, 2016, we had $70,231 in obligations under the Prior Credit Agreement and the Note Agreement (without adjustment for unamortized debt issuance costs).  
     
 22   

Table of Contents   
     
  The Prior Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to maximum leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage.  The Prior Credit Agreement also includes other covenants and restrictions, including limits on the amount of certain types of capital expenditures.  The Company was in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2016.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the amount available to borrow under the Credit Agreement was approximately $22,800.  
     
  The average China Facility balance for 2016 was $1,600 (RMB 10,600).  At September 30, 2016, there was approximately $235 (RMB 1,570) available under the facility.  
     
  During 2016, the Company paid dividends of $0.025 per share in each of the three quarters, or $0.075 for the first nine months of 2016.  The Company s working capital, capital expenditure and dividend requirements are expected to be funded from cash provided by operations and amounts available under the Credit Agreement.  
     
    Item 3.                Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk     
     
    Foreign Currency    
     
  We have international operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, China, Portugal, Germany, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Yuan Renminbi, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.  We continuously evaluate our foreign currency risk and will take action from time to time in order to best mitigate these risks.  A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $2,300 on our third quarter sales and $7,400 on our year to date sales.  This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to partially offsetting impacts on cost of sales and operating expenses in those currencies.  We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the three ended September 30, 2016 had no impact on sales compared to the same period in 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased sales in comparison to 2015 by approximately $100.  
     
  We translate all assets and liabilities of our international operations, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, at the period-end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period.  The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income.  The translation adjustment was a gain of $383 and $400 for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The translation adjustment was a gain of $1,346 and loss of $3,162 for the year to date 2016 and 2015 periods, respectively.  Translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our international subsidiaries.  Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in Other income, net amounted to a gain of $5 and a loss of $94 for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For the year to date 2016, a $20 loss has been recognized in Other income, net compared to a $242 gain for 2015.  A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $4,900 on our foreign net assets as of September 30, 2016.  
     
    Interest Rates    
     
  On October 28, 2016, the Company entered into a new $125,000 Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility that replaces the Prior Credit Agreement and Senior Subordinated Notes.  Refer to Item 5. Other Information in Part II and Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 18. Subsequent Event in Part I for information.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, interest rates on our Prior Credit Facility were based on the Base Rate plus a margin of 0.25% to 2.00% (currently 1.50%) or the Eurocurrency Rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 3.00% (currently 2.0%).  The Company uses interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  The Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  During October 2013, the Company entered into two Interest Rate Swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 that amortize quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at maturity.  This swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge.  Refer to Note 7 of the  Unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  for information about our derivative financial instruments.

Table of Contents   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had $31,500 outstanding under the Term Loan, of which $15,750 was being hedged.  Refer to Note 9 of the  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  for additional information about our outstanding debt at September 30, 2016.  A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the $15,750 of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2016 would have an impact of approximately $43 on our interest expense for the third quarter 2016 and $103 for the year to date 2016.  
     
    Item 4.                Controls and Procedures     
     
   Conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures   
     
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal accounting officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2016.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  
     
  Based on management s evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  
     
   Changes in internal control over financial reporting   
     
  During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, with the exception Heidrive, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
     
   Note regarding acquisition   
     
  In making our assessment of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, we have excluded the operations of Heidrive. We are currently assessing the control environment of this acquired business. Our consolidated financial statements reflect Heidrive s results of operations from January 12, 2016.  Heidrive s net sales constituted approximately 13% of our net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and Heidrive s assets constituted approximately 7% of the Company s total assets as of September 30, 2016.

    Item 5.                Other Information     
     
   Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement - Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility   
     
  On October 28, 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) for a $125,000 revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Facility ).  The Revolving Facility includes a $50,000 accordion amount and has an initial term of five years.  HSBC Bank USA, National Association is the administrative agent, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. is the sole lead arranger and sole book runner, and Keybank National Association and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association are co-syndication agents.  
     
  Borrowings under the Revolving Facility will bear interest at the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% or the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin of 0% to 1.25%, in each case depending on the Company s ratio of total funded indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Consolidated EBITDA (the  Total Leverage Ratio ).  At October 28, 2016, the applicable margin for LIBOR Rate borrowings was 1.75% and the applicable margin for Prime Rate borrowings was 0.75%.  In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of between 0.10% and 0.25% quarterly (currently 0.175%) on the unused portion of the Revolving facility, also based on the Company s Total Leverage Ratio.  The Revolving Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company s non-realty assets and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Company s subsidiaries.  
     
  Financial covenants under the Credit Agreement require the Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0:1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter.  In addition, the Company s Total Leverage Ratio at the end of any fiscal quarter shall not be greater than 3.75:1.0 through March 31, 2017, 3.5:1.0 through September 30, 2017, 3.25:1.0 through March 31, 2018 and 3.0:1.0 thereafter; provided that the Company may elect to temporarily increase the Total Leverage Ratio by 0.5x over the otherwise maximum during the twelve-month period following a permitted acquisition under the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement also includes covenants and restrictions that limit the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of its assets and enter into transactions with an affiliate of the Company on other than an arms  length transaction.  These covenants, which are described more fully in the Credit Agreement, to which reference is made for a complete statement of the covenants, are subject to certain exceptions.  
     
  The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, including failure to pay principal, interest or fees when due, failure to comply with covenants, if any representation or warranty made by the Company is false or misleading in any material respect, default under certain other indebtedness, certain insolvency or receivership events affecting the Company and its subsidiaries, the occurrence of certain material judgments, the occurrence of certain ERISA events, the invalidity of the loan documents or a change in control of the Company.  The amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility may be accelerated upon certain events of default.  
     
  The above description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
     
   Termination of Material Definitive Agreements   
     
  The Revolving Facility replaced the Company s previous Credit Agreement dated as of October 18, 2013, as amended, among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto (the  Prior Credit Agreement ).  The Prior Credit Agreement was scheduled to mature on October 18, 2018 and provided revolving credit up to $30,000 and a $50,000 term loan.  $40,531 was outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement at the time of termination.  
     
  The Revolving Facility also replaced the Company s 14.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due October 18, 2019 (the  Notes ) issued pursuant to a Note Agreement dated October 18, 2013, as amended, with Prudential Capital Partners IV, L.P. and its affiliates.  $30,000 was outstanding under the Notes at the time of redemption.

  (f)             a receiver or an administrative receiver does not include a  curator  or  bewindvoerder ; and

   1.11                    Additional Alternative Currencies  . 
     
  (a)            The Company may from time to time request that Libor Loans be made and/or Letters of Credit be issued in a currency other than those specifically listed in the definition of  Alternative Currency   provided  that (i) such requested currency is a lawful currency that is readily available and freely transferable and convertible into Dollars and (ii) such requested currency shall only be treated as a  Libor Quoted Currency  to the extent that there is a published Libor Rate for such currency.  In the case of any such request with respect to the making of Libor Loans, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and each Lender; and in the case of any such request with respect to the issuance of Letters of Credit, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer. 
     
  (b)            Any such request shall be made to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date of the desired Credit Extension (or such other time or date as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent and, in the case of any such request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the L/C Issuer, in its or their sole discretion).  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of any such request; and in the case of any such request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the L/C Issuer thereof.  Each Lender or the L/C Issuer (in the case of a request pertaining to Letters of Credit) shall notify the Administrative Agent, not later than 11:00 a.m., ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such request whether it consents, in its sole discretion, to the making of Libor Loans or the issuance of Letters of Credit, as the case may be, in such requested currency. 
     
  (c)            Any failure by a Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to respond to such request within the time period specified in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a refusal by such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to permit Libor Loans to be made or Letters of Credit to be issued in such requested currency.  If the Administrative Agent and all the Lenders consent to making Libor Loans in such requested currency and the Administrative 
     
 33   

Agent and such Lenders reasonably determine that an appropriate interest rate is available to be used for such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Company and (i) the Administrative Agent and such Lenders may amend the definition of Libor Rate for any Non-Libor Quoted Currency to the extent necessary to add the applicable Libor Rate for such currency and (ii) to the extent the definition of Libor Rate reflects the appropriate interest rate for such currency or has been amended to reflect the appropriate rate for such currency, such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency for purposes of any Borrowings of Libor Loans.  If the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer consent to the issuance of Letters of Credit in such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Company and (A) the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may amend the definition of Libor Rate for any Non-Libor Quoted Currency to the extent necessary to add the applicable Libor Rate for such currency and (B) to the extent the definition of Libor Rate reflects the appropriate interest rate for such currency or has been amended to reflect the appropriate rate for such currency, such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency, for purposes of any Letter of Credit issuances.  If the Administrative Agent shall fail to obtain consent to any request for an additional currency under this  Section 1.11 , the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Company.

   THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS   
     
   2.01                    Loans  . 
     
  (a)           Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make loans to the Company (each such loan, a   Domestic Loan  ) in Dollars on any Business Day during the Availability Period, or loans to Allied B.V. (each such loan, a   Foreign Loan  , and collectively with the Domestic Loans, the   Loans  ) in Alternative Currency on a Business Day during the Availability Period in an aggregate amount that will not result in the Outstanding Amount of Loans of such Lender exceeding such Lender s Loan Commitment at such time;  provided ,  however , that after giving effect to any Loan, (A) the Outstanding Amount shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments, (B) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Loans of any Lender,  plus  such Lender s Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, shall not exceed such Lender s Commitment and (C)  the Outstanding Amount of all Foreign Loans, plus Foreign Letters of Credit shall not exceed the Foreign Sublimit.  Within the limits of each Lender s Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers may borrow under this  Section 2.01(a) , prepay under  Section 2.04 , and reborrow under this  Section 2.01(a) .  Foreign Loans shall be Libor Loans and Domestic Loans may be ABR Loans or Libor Loans, as further provided herein.  
     
  (b)            Each Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of Loans made to such Borrower outstanding on such date. 
     
 34   

2.02                    Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans  . 
     
  (a)           Each conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Loans which are Libor Loans shall be made upon the applicable Borrower s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone or a Loan Notice;  provided  that any telephone notice must be confirmed immediately by delivering to the Administrative Agent a Loan Notice.  Each such Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Libor Loans denominated in Dollars or of any conversion of Libor Loans denominated in Dollars to ABR Loans, (B) four Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or continuation of Loans denominated in Alternative Currency.  Each telephonic notice pursuant to this  Section 2.02(a)(i)  must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the applicable Borrower.  Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Libor Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or the Dollar Equivalent thereof, or a whole multiple of $500,000 or the Dollar Equivalent thereof in excess thereof.  Except as provided in  Section 2.02(c)  each Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or the Dollar Equivalent thereof, or a whole multiple of $100,000 or the Dollar Equivalent thereof in excess thereof.  Each Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (v) whether a Borrower is requesting a Loan, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Loans which are Libor Loans, (w) the requested date of the Loan, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (x) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued and the currency thereof, (y) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, and (z) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto.  If either Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if either Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to, ABR Loans; provided, however, that in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of Loans denominated in Alternative Currency, such Loans shall be continued as Libor Loans in their original currency with an Interest Period of one month.  Any automatic conversion to ABR Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Libor Loans.  If either Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Libor Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.  No Loan may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan, and in the case of Loans, reborrowed in the other currency.  
     
  (b)           Following receipt of a Loan Notice from either Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount (and currency) of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Company, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to ABR Loans or continuation of Domestic Loans, in each case as described in the preceding subsection.  Each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent s Office for the applicable currency not later than 1:00 p.m., in the case of any Domestic Loan, and not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of any Foreign Loan, in each case on the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice.  
     
 35   

(c)           Except as otherwise provided herein, a Libor Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Libor Loan.  During the existence of a Default, no portions of the Loans may be converted to or continued as Libor Loans (whether in Dollars or any Alternative Currency) without the consent of the Required Lenders, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the then outstanding Libor Loans denominated in Dollars be converted immediately to ABR Loans and any or all of the then outstanding Libor Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency be prepaid, or redenominated into Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto.  
     
  (d)           The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Libor Loans upon determination of such interest rate.  At any time that ABR Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders of any change in the ABR Rate resulting from a change in the Prime Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.  
     
  (e)           After giving effect to all new Loans, all conversions of Loans from one Type to the Other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest Periods in effect with respect to Loans.

  (i)                Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Lenders set forth in this  Section 2.03 , (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or in one or more Alternative Currencies, and to amend or extend Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with subsection (b) below, and (2) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Company or Allied B.V. and any drawings thereunder;  provided  that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, (w) the Outstanding Amounts shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments, (x) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of any Lender, shall not exceed such Lender s Commitment, (y) the Outstanding Amount of all Foreign Loans plus Foreign Letters of Credit shall not exceed the Foreign Sublimit, and (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit.  Each request by a Borrower for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by the Borrowers that the L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence.  Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers  ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrowers may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed.  
     
  (ii)               The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit, if:  
     
 36   

(A)          subject to  Section 2.03(b)(iii) , the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance or last extension, unless the Required Lenders have approved such expiry date; or  
     
  (B)          the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless the L/C Issuer and all the Lenders have approved such expiry date.  
     
  (iii)              The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:  
     
  (A)          any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;  
     
  (B)          the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally;  
     
  (C)          such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars or Alternative Currency;  
     
  (D)          such Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder;  
     
  (E)           any Lender is at such time a Defaulting Lender, unless the L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements satisfactory to the L/C Issuer with the Borrowers and/or such Impacted Lender to eliminate such L/C Issuer s risk with respect to such Defaulting Lender; or  
     
  (F)           the L/C Issuer does not as of the issuance date of such requested Letter of Credit issue Letters of Credit in the requested currency.  
     
  (iv)             The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if the L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof.  
     
  (v)              The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend or extend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment or extension to such Letter of Credit.  
     
 37   

(vi)             The L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in  Article IX  with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term  Administrative Agent  as used in  Article IX  included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer.  
     
  (b)              Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit   .  
     
  (i)                Each Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended or extended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Company or Allied B.V. delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the applicable Borrower.  Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two (2) Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment or date of extension, as the case may be.  In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount and currency thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require.

Additionally, applicable Borrower shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may require.  
     
  (ii)               Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Company or Allied B.V. and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof.  Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from the Administrative Agent or any Lender, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in  Article IV  shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Company or Allied B.V., as applicable or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer s usual and customary business practices.  Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of  
     
 38   

Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender s Applicable Percentage  times  the amount of such Letter of Credit.  
     
  (iii)              If the Company or Allied B.V. so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an   Auto-Extension Letter of Credit    provided  that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving 30-days  prior notice to the beneficiary thereof (the   Non-Extension Notice Date  ).  Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the applicable Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension.  Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;  provided ,  however , that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) of  Section 2.03(a)  or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Company or Allied B.V., as applicable, that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in  Section 4.02  is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.  
     
  (iv)             Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Company or Allied B.V. and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.  
     
  (c)              Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations  . 
     
  (i)                Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof.  In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer in such Alternative Currency, unless (A) the L/C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (B) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the applicable Borrower shall have notified the L/C Issuer promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that the applicable Borrower will reimburse the L/C Issuer in Dollars.  In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the L/C Issuer shall notify the applicable Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof.  Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an   Honor Date  ), the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the  
     
 39   

applicable currency.  If the applicable Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) (the   Unreimbursed Amount  ), and the amount of such Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof.  In such event, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Loan of ABR Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in  Section 2.02  for the principal amount of ABR Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in  Section 4.02  (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice).  Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this  Section 2.03(c)(i)  may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing;  provided  that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.  
     
  (ii)               Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to  Section 2.03(c)(i)  make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer, in Dollars, at the Administrative Agent s Office for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of  Section 2.03(c)(iii) , each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made an ABR Loan to the Company in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer in Dollars.  
     
  (iii)              With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Loan of ABR Loans because the conditions set forth in  Section 4.02  cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Company shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.  In such event, each Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to  Section 2.03(c)(ii)  shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this  Section 2.03 .  
     
  (iv)             Until each Lender funds its Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this  Section 2.03(c)  to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.  
     
  (v)              Each Lender s obligation to make Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this  Section 2.03(c) , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Company, any Subsidiary or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;  provided ,  however , that each Lender s obligation to make Loans pursuant to this  Section 2.03(c)  is subject  
     
 40   

to the conditions set forth in  Section 4.02  (other than delivery by the Company of a Loan Notice).  No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Company to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.  
     
  (vi)             If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this  Section 2.03(c)  by the time specified in  Section 2.03(c)(ii) , the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing.  If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be.  A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  
     
  (d)              Repayment of Participations  . 
     
  (i)                At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with  Section 2.03(c) , if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Company or Allied B.V. or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in Dollars and in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.  
     
  (ii)               If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to  Section 2.03(c)(i)  is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in  Section 10.05  (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  
     
  (e)              Obligations Absolute  .  The obligation of the Company or Allied B.V. to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:

  (iv)             waiver by the L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for the L/C Issuer s protection and not the protection of the Borrowers or any waiver by the L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice the Borrowers;

In the event the Increasing Lenders (as defined below) do not commit the full increase requested, Company may select, in consultation with the Administrative Agent, such increase to be provided by one or more Lenders (each Lender so agreeing to an increase in its Commitment an   Increasing Lender  ) one or more new banks, financial institutions or other entities (each such new bank, financial institution or other entity, an   Augmenting Lender  ), to extend a Commitment;  provided  that each Augmenting Lender shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Administrative Agent and the reasonable approval of the Company, and provided further that each Increasing Lender and each Augmenting Lender executes documentation in form and content satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to either become a party to this Agreement or reflect the increase of such Lender s Commitment under this Agreement, it being understood that all terms and conditions of such increase shall be identical to the terms and conditions of the credit facility described herein prior to such increase.  At the time of sending a notice requesting an increase in the Commitments, the Administrative Agent shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond which shall in no event be less than ten (10) Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders (  Notice Period  ). 
     
  (b)             Lender Elections to Increase  .  Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within the Notice Period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and the amount thereof, which decision shall be made in such Lender s sole discretion.

 46   

(d)             Effective Date and Allocations  .  If the Commitments are increased as provided in this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Company shall determine the effective date (  Increase Effective Date  ) and the final allocation of such increase.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date.  
     
  (e)             Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase  .  As a condition precedent to such increase, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an opinion of counsel to the Borrowers addressed to each Lender and counsel to the Administrative Agent, and in form and content satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and substantially in the form issued in connection with this Agreement, together with a certificate dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer of Company (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrowers approving or consenting to such increase, (ii) certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained in  Article V  and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this  Section 2.05 , the representations and warranties contained in  Section 5.05  shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of  Section 6.01 , and (B) no Event of Default or Default exists, and (iii) attaching updated financial projections in form and substance satisfactory to the Lenders demonstrating that, before and after giving effect to such increase on a pro forma basis, the Company will be in compliance with the financial covenants in  Section 7.10 .  
     
  (f)              Commitment Adjustments  .  Each of the parties hereto agrees that the Administrative Agent may, in consultation with Company, take any and all actions as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that after giving effect to any increase in the Commitments pursuant to this Section, the outstanding Loans (if any) are held by the Lenders with Commitments in accordance with their new Applicable Percentages as shown on an updated  Schedule 2.01  which will be attached to this Agreement.  This may be accomplished at the discretion of the Administrative Agent, as applicable:  (i) by requiring the outstanding Loans to be prepaid with the proceeds of the new Loans; (ii) by causing the Non Increasing Lenders to assign portions of their outstanding Loans to Increasing Lenders and Augmenting Lenders; (iii) by permitting the Loans outstanding at the time of any increase in the Commitment pursuant to this  Section 2.05  to remain outstanding until the last days of the respective Interest Periods, therefor, even though the Lenders would hold such Loans other than in accordance with their new Applicable Percentages; or (iv) by any combination of the foregoing.

  (ii)           If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by any Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.  
     
  (iii)           Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, the applicable Borrowers shall pay interest on the principal amount of their outstanding respective Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

The commitment fees shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in  Article IV  is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December, or if the last day of such month is not a Business Day, on the next Business Day thereafter and on the last day of the Availability Period.  The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.

  (a)            All computations of fees and interest on ABR Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days, or 366 days during a leap year, for the actual number of days elapsed.  All computations of fees and interest on Libor Loans shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year), or, in the case of interest in respect of Loans denominated in Alternative Currency as which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice.  Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid,  provided  that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to  Section 2.10(a) , bear interest for one day.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
     
  (b)            If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Company, the Company or the Lenders determine that (i) the Total Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Company as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Total Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, each Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period.  This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under  Section 2.03(c)(iii) ,  2.03(i)  or  2.06(b)  or under  Article VIII .  The Borrowers  obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder. 
     
   2.09                    Evidence of Debt  . 
     
  (a)            The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender to a Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, such Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a note or notes, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans to such Borrower, as applicable, in addition to such accounts or records. 
     
 49   

Each Lender may attach schedules to a Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.  
     
  (b)            In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
     
   2.10                    Payments Generally; Administrative Agent s Clawback  . 
     
  (a)              General  .  All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in Alternative Currency, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent s Office in Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States.  If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 
     
  (b)              Funding by Lenders and Payments by Borrowers; Presumption by Administrative Agent  .

Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with  Section 2.02  (or, in the case of a Borrowing of ABR Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by  Section 2.02 ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Revolving Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by such Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.  
     
  (ii)               Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.   
     
  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Company with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  
     
  (c)              Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent  .  If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to any Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this  Article II , and such funds are not made available to such Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in  Article IV  are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
     
  (d)              Obligations of Lenders Several  .  The obligations of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder, including any obligations to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to  Section 10.04(c)  are several 
     
 51   

and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under  Section 10.04(c)  on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under  Section 10.04(c) .  
     
  (e)              Funding Source  .  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
     
   2.11                    Sharing of Payments by Lenders  .  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it resulting in such Lender s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them;  provided  that: 
     
  (i)                if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and  
     
  (ii)               the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than to the Loan Parties or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).  
     
  Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.  
     
   2.12                    Collateral Security  .  Subject to  Section 6.12 , the Obligations shall be secured by a perfected first priority security interest (subject only to Liens permitted by  Section 7.01  entitled to priority under applicable law) in the following property of the Loan Parties, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, (i) all personal property of each Domestic Loan Party, (ii) all Equity Interests of all Domestic Subsidiaries of each Loan Party and all Equity Interests of each first-tier Foreign Subsidiary of each Domestic Loan Party;  provided  that, the Company shall not 
     
 52   

be required to pledge its Equity Interests in Allied Motion Canada Inc., Globe Inc. shall not be required to pledge its Equity Interests in Globe Motors de Mexico SA de CV, no Loan Party shall be required to pledge its Equity Interests in a Non-Material Subsidiary, and with respect to Foreign Subsidiaries, such equity pledge shall be limited to 65% of the capital stock of such Foreign Subsidiary to the extent the pledge secures Domestic Loan Party Obligations and a pledge of any greater percentage would result in material adverse tax consequences to any Loan Party (for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the equity pledge of the Foreign Subsidiary secures Foreign Loan Party Obligations, such limitation shall not apply) and all proceeds and products of the property and assets described in (i) and (ii) above.  In the event that Allied B.V. is no longer a first-tier Foreign Subsidiary of a Domestic Loan Party, then the Administrative Agent shall immediately terminate its security interest in the Equity Interests of Allied B.V. and deliver any certificates evidencing such Equity Interests to the Company for delivery to the Person owning the same.  
     
   2.13                    Intentionally Omitted  . 
     
   2.14                    Defaulting Lenders  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: 
     
  (a)           Any payment of principal, interest or fees delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to  Article VIII  or otherwise) shall, for so long as such Defaulting Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender, be held by the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized and directed by all parties hereto to hold such funds in escrow and apply such funds as follows:  
     
  (i)                 First , if applicable, to any payments due to the L/C Issuer pursuant to  Section 2.03(c)  of this Agreement or the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as Administrative Agent under  Article IX  of this Agreement; and  
     
  (ii)                Second , to Loans required to be made by such Defaulting Lender on any borrowing date to the extent such Defaulting Lender fails to make such Loans; and  
     
  (iii)               Third , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers, the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent against such defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;  
     
  (iv)              Fourth , to the payment of any amount due to the Borrowers under  Section 2.10(b)  of this Agreement; and  
     
  (v)               Fifth , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;  provided  that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Advances in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate shares and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in  Section 4.02  were satisfied or waived, such payment  
     
 53   

shall be applied solely to pay the Loans, and L/C Advances, owed to all Lenders that are not Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans or L/C Advances owed to such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded L/C Obligations are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments.  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owned by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this  Section 2.14  shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  
     
  (b)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the termination of the Commitments and the payment and performance of all of the Indebtedness and other obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement (other than those owing to a Defaulting Lender), any funds then held in escrow by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be distributed to each Defaulting Lender, pro rata in proportion to amounts that would be due to each Defaulting Lender but for the fact that it is a Defaulting Lender.  
     
  (c)           If the Company, the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer agree in writing that a Lender should no longer be deemed a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, take such actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a  pro rata  basis by Lenders in accordance with their Commitments, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;  provided  that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the applicable Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and  provided ,  further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender.  
     
   2.15                    Commitment Termination and Reduction  .  (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitment shall terminate on the Maturity Date. 
     
  (b)           The Company may, at any time by three (3) Business Days prior written notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent state the Company s desire to reduce the Aggregate Commitments to any amount which is not less than the aggregate of the then outstanding principal amount of Loans and the face amount of outstanding undrawn Letters of Credit, if any.  Any reductions of the Aggregate Commitments shall not be reinstated at any future date (except in accordance with the provisions of  Section 2.05 ) and any partial reduction shall be in the amount of $2,500,000 and in incremental multiples of $500,000 thereafter.  Two (2) Business Days after receipt of such reduction notice, the obligation of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder or purchase participations in Loans or Letters of Credit hereunder shall be limited to the Aggregate Commitments as reduced pursuant to said notice.  Any such reduction of the Commitment shall be accompanied by payment of any applicable Breakage Fees.

  (a)              Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes  . 
     
  (i)                Any and all payments by or on account of any Obligation of the respective Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent permitted by applicable Laws be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes.  If, however, applicable Laws require any Borrower or the Administrative Agent to withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such Laws as determined by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below.  
     
  (ii)               If any Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by such Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.  
     
  (iii)              If any Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount so withheld or deducted by it to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by such Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.  
     
 55   

(b)              Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers  .  Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, each Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws. 
     
  (c)              Tax Indemnifications  . 
     
  (i)                Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, and shall make payment in respect thereof within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) withheld or deducted by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent or paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  Each Borrower shall also, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or the L/C Issuer for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required by clause (ii) of this subsection.  A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to a Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error;  provided  that such certificate contains a reasonably detailed statement of the amounts then payable and the calculations thereof.  
     
  (ii)               Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Lender and the L/C Issuer shall, and does hereby, indemnify on a several basis each Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor, against any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for such Borrower or the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against such Borrower or the Administrative Agent by any Governmental Authority as a result of the failure by such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered by such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to such Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (e).  Each Lender and the L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii).  The agreements in this clause (ii) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.  
     
  (d)              Evidence of Payments  .  Upon request by a Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by such Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this  Section 3.01 , such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the 
     
 56   

Administrative Agent shall deliver to such Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be.  
     
  (e)              Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation  . 
     
  (i)                Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in  Sections 3.01(e)(ii)(A) ,  (ii)(B)  and  (ii)(D)  below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  
     
  (ii)               Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Borrower is a U.S. Person,  
     
  (A)          any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;  
     
  (B)          any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  
     
  (1)           in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  interest  article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or  
     
 57   

W-8BEN, as applicable)  establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  business profits  or  other income  article of such tax treaty;  
     
  (2)           executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;

  (4)           to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit M-2 or Exhibit M-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;  provided  that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit M-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;  
     
  (C)          any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed copies (or originals, as required) of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and  
     
  (D)          if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation  
     
 58   

prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  
     
  (iii)              Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this  Section 3.01  expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  
     
  (iv)             For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from and after the effective date of this Agreement, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) the Loans as not qualifying as a  grandfathered obligation  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).  
     
  (f)              Treatment of Certain Refunds .   Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be.  If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this  Section 3.01 , it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this  Section 3.01  with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);  provided  that each Loan Party, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to such Loan Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.  
     
  (g)             Survival .   Each party s obligations under this  Section 3.01  shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the  
     
 59   

replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.  
     
   3.02                    Illegality and Designated Lenders  . 
     
  (a)             Illegality  .  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Libor Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Libor Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Libor Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Libor Loans in Dollars, to convert ABR Loans to Libor Loans, shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, the applicable Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all such Libor Loans of such Lender to ABR Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Libor Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Libor Loans.

  (b)             Designated Lenders  .  Each Lender at its option may make any Credit Extension to any Borrower by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender (each a   Designated Lender  ) to make such Credit Extension (and in the case of an Affiliate, the provisions of  Sections 3.01  through  3.05  and  10.04  shall apply to such Affiliate to the same extent as to such Lender);  provided  that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the relevant Borrower to repay such Credit Extension in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;  provided ,  however , if any Lender or any Designated Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Designated Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension to either Borrower who is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States, a State thereof or the District of Columbia then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, and until such notice by such Lender is revoked, any obligation of such Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Credit Extension shall be suspended.

 60   

Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or (c) the Libor Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Libor Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Libor Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender.  Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Libor Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, either Borrower, as applicable, may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Libor Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of ABR Loans in the amount specified therein or to another type of loan at an alternate rate offered by the Administrative Agent.

  (vi)             Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s right to demand such compensation;  provided  that the applicable Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s intention to claim compensation therefor;  provided further  that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

  (b)            declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers;

   provided  ,  however , that upon the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to any Borrower under any Debtor Relief Law, the obligation of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions shall automatically terminate, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans and all interest and other amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, and the obligation of the applicable Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations as aforesaid shall automatically become effective, in each case without further act of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of a direction by the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall seek to enforce the Security Documents and to realize upon the Collateral in accordance with such direction;  provided ,  however , that the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to follow any direction by Required Lenders if Administrative Agent reasonably determines that such direction is in conflict with any provisions of any applicable law or any Security Document and the Administrative Agent shall not, under any circumstance be liable to any Lenders or the L/C Issuer for following the direction of the Required Lenders. At all times, if the Administrative Agent acting at the direction of the Required Lenders advises the 
     
 90   

Lenders that it wishes to proceed in good faith with respect to any enforcement action, each of the Lenders will cooperate in good faith with respect to such enforcement action and will not unreasonably delay the enforcement of the Security Documents.

   Fifth  , to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer, to Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C Obligations comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit; 
     
   Sixth  , to all other Obligations; and 
     
   Last  , the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, to the Company or as otherwise required by Law. 
     
  Subject to  Section 2.03(g) , amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause  Fifth  above shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur.  If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.

ARTICLE IX   
     
   ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT   
     
   9.01                    Appointment and Authority  . 
     
  (a)            Each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints HSBC Bank to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, and each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, on its behalf, to enter into and deliver each Security Document.  The provisions of this  Article IX  are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, and no Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  Each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer authorize the Administrative Agent to accept the parallel debt provisions as included in each of the Loan Documents governed by Dutch law. 
     
  (b)           In its capacity, the Administrative Agent is a  representative  of the Credit Parties within the meaning of the term  secured party  as defined in the UCC.  Each Lender confirms its authority for the Administrative Agent entering into each of the Security Documents to which it is a party and to take all action contemplated by such documents.  Each Lender agrees that no Credit Party (other than the Administrative Agent) shall have the right individually to seek to realize upon the security granted by any Security Document, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Credit Parties upon the terms of the Security Documents.  In the event that any Collateral is hereafter pledged by any Person as collateral security for the Secured Obligations, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, and hereby granted a power of attorney, to execute and deliver on behalf of the Credit Parties any Loan Documents necessary or appropriate to grant and perfect a Lien on such Collateral in favor of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Credit Parties.  The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the Administrative Agent upon any Collateral (i) as described in  Section 10.01 ; (ii) as permitted by, but only in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Loan Document; or (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, unless such release is required to be approved by all of the Lenders hereunder.  Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent s authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant hereto.  Upon any sale or transfer of assets constituting Collateral which is permitted pursuant to the terms of any Loan Document, or consented to in writing by the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as applicable, and upon at least five (5) Business Days  prior written request by the Company to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) (a) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Credit Parties on the Collateral that was sold or transferred or (b) release any Guaranty provided by any Subsidiary if the assets sold or transferred constitute all of the Equity Interests directly or indirectly owned by the Company in such Subsidiary;  provided ,  however , that (i) the Administrative Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms  
     
 92   

which, in the Administrative Agent s opinion, would expose the Administrative Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Secured Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of any Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of) all interests retained by any Borrower or any Subsidiary, including (without limitation) the proceeds of the sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.  
     
  (c)           (i)            Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to administer and enforce this Agreement on behalf of the Credit Parties, and the other Security Documents to which it is a party and to foreclose upon, collect and dispose of the Collateral and to apply the proceeds therefrom, for the benefit of the Credit Parties, as provided in this Agreement, and otherwise to perform its duties and obligations as the representative of the Credit Parties thereunder in accordance with the terms hereof.  The Administrative Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in the Security Documents to which it is a party as Administrative Agent, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into any such Security Documents against the Administrative Agent, and its duties thereunder shall be administrative in nature only, whether or not a default has occurred and is continuing.  
     
  (ii)           The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to the other Credit Parties for (A) the performance or observance by any Borrower or any of the Credit Parties (other than as to itself) of any of their respective agreements contained herein or therein, nor shall the Administrative Agent be liable because of the invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this Agreement (other than as to itself) or (B) the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of the Liens in any of the Collateral, whether impaired by operation of law or by reason of any action or omission to act on its part hereunder (except to the extent such action or omission constitutes gross negligence, or willful misconduct on the part of the Administrative Agent), the validity of the title to the Collateral, insuring the Collateral or the payment of taxes, charges, assessments or Liens upon the Collateral or otherwise as to the maintenance of the Collateral.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable or responsible to the Lenders for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or in connection herewith, (y) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or (z) in the absence of its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as and to the extent determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.  
     
  (iii)          In the event that the Administrative Agent is required to acquire title to an asset for any reason, or take any managerial action of any kind in regard thereto, in order to carry out any obligation for the benefit of another, which in the Administrative Agent s sole discretion may cause the Administrative Agent to be considered an  owner or operator  under the provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (  CERCLA  ), 42 U.S.C.  9601, et seq., or otherwise cause the Administrative Agent to incur liability under CERCLA or any other federal, state or local law, the Administrative Agent reserves the right, instead of taking such action, to either resign as the Administrative Agent or arrange for the transfer of the title or control of the asset to a court-appointed receiver. Except for such claims or actions arising directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable to any person or entity for any environmental claims or contribution actions under any federal,  
     
 93   

state or local law, rule or regulation by reason of the Administrative Agent s actions and conduct as authorized, empowered and directed hereunder or relating to the discharge, release or threatened release of hazardous materials into the environment. If at any time after any foreclosure on the Collateral (or a transfer in lieu of foreclosure) upon the exercise of remedies in accordance with the Security Documents it is necessary or advisable to take possession, own, operate or manage any portion of the Collateral by any person or entity other than the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall appoint an appropriately qualified Person to possess, own, operate or manage such Collateral.  
     
  (iv)          The powers conferred on the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and related Security Documents are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the safe custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession and the accounting for monies actually received by it, the Administrative Agent shall have no other duty as to the Collateral, whether or not the Administrative Agent or any of the other Lenders or L/C Issuer has or is deemed to have knowledge of any matters, or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties or any other rights pertaining to the Collateral. The Administrative Agent hereby agrees to exercise reasonable care in respect of the custody and preservation of the Collateral. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Administrative Agent accords its own property.  
     
   9.02                    Rights as a Lender  .  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term  Lender  or  Lenders  shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 
     
   9.03                    Exculpatory Provisions  .  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: 
     
  (a)            shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; 
     
  (b)            shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents);  provided  that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law including, for the avoidance of doubt, any action that may be in violation of the 
     
 94   

automatic stay or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of a property interest in violation of any applicable bankruptcy/insolvency laws and the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act under the Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it first receives further assurances of its indemnification from the Lenders that the Administrative Agent reasonably believes it may require, including prepayment of any related expenses and any other protection it requires against any and all costs, expenses and liabilities it may incur in taking or continuing to take any such discretionary action at the direction of the Required Lenders;  
     
  (c)           shall not be required to expend or risk any of its own funds or otherwise incur any liability, financial or otherwise, in the performance of its duties under the Loan Documents or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers under this Agreement ; and 
     
  (d)            shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any of the Borrowers or any of their respective Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. 
     
  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in  Sections 10.01  and  8.02 ) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company, a Lender or the L/C Issuer.  
     
  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition present set forth in  Article IV  or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.  
     
   9.04                    Reliance by Administrative Agent  . 
     
  (a)            The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance  
     
 95   

with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  
     
  (b)            The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
     
   9.05                    Delegation of Duties  .  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this  Article IX  shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. 
     
   9.06                    Resignation of Administrative Agent  .  The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Company.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, and, if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Company, (which consent shall be unreasonably withheld) to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above;  provided  that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section.  Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section).  The fees 
     
 96   

payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor.  After the retiring Administrative Agent s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this  Article IX  and  Section 10.04  shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.  
     
  Any resignation by HSBC Bank as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer.  Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer, (b) the retiring L/C Issuer shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.  
     
   9.07                    Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders  .  Each Lender and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender and the L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

Until the interpretation of the term  public  (as referred to in Article 4.1(1) of the CRR) has been published by the competent authority, the share of a Lender in any Loan requested by Allied B.V. and, consequently, the amount transferred by one Lender to another Lender in relation to a Loan to Allied B.V. should be at least EUR 5,000,000 (or the foreign currency equivalent thereof) and as soon as the interpretation of the term  public  has been published by the competent authority, the Lender to which the assignment is made may not be considered to be part of the public on the basis of such interpretation.

  (e)              Limitations upon Participant Rights  .  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under  Section 3.01  or  3.04  than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company s prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of  Section 3.01  unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with  Section 3.01(e)  as though it were a Lender.

   10.18                  Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents  .  The words  delivery,   execute,   execution,   signed,   signature,  and words of like import in any Loan Document or any other documents executed in connection herewith shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, the electronic matching of assignment terms and contract formations on electronic platforms approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of 
     
 115   

records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act;  provided  that notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary neither the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer nor any Lender is under any obligation to agree to accept electronic signatures in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender pursuant to procedures approved by it and provided further, without limiting the foregoing, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, any electronic signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart.  
     
   10.19                  Judgment Currency  .  If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the   Judgment Currency  ) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the   Agreement Currency  ), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender from any Borrower in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law). 
     
   10.20                  Guaranty by the Company  . 
     
  (a)            The Company shall be liable for and hereby guarantees the timely payment by Allied B.V., of all Loans, fees and any other Obligations owing to or for the account of any one or more Lenders (and their Affiliates in respect of Bank Product Obligations), regardless of which Borrower actually may have received the proceeds of any Loans or other extensions of credit hereunder or the amount of such Loans received or the manner in which the Administrative Agent or any Lender accounts for such Loans or other extensions of credit on its books and records.  Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are relying on the guaranty of the Company in extending the Loans and other financial accommodations to Allied B.V. hereunder. 
     
 116   

(b)            The Company s guaranty of the Loans to Allied B.V. and other Obligations of Allied B.V. shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, be unconditional irrespective of (i) the validity, enforceability, avoidance or subordination of any part of the Obligations or of any promissory note or other document evidencing all or any part of such Obligations, (ii) the absence of any attempt to collect any of such Obligations from Allied B.V. or any Collateral or other security therefor, or the absence of any other action to enforce the same, (iii) the waiver, consent, extension, forbearance or granting of any indulgence by the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to any provision of any instrument evidencing or securing the payment of any of such Obligations, or any other agreement now or hereafter executed by any other agreement now or hereafter executed by Allied B.V. and delivered to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (iv) the failure by the Administrative Agent to take any steps to perfect or maintain the perfected status of its security interest in or Lien upon, or to preserve its rights to, any of the Collateral or other security for the payment or performance of any of such Obligations or the Administrative Agent s release of any Collateral or of its Liens upon any Collateral, (v) the Administrative Agent s or any Lender s election, in any proceeding instituted under the Bankruptcy Code, for the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, (vi) any borrowing or grant of a security interest by Allied B.V. as debtor-in-possession under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, (vii) the release or compromise, in whole or in part, of the liability of Allied B.V. for the payment of any of such Obligations, (viii) any amendment or modification of any of the Loan Documents or any waiver of a Default or Event of Default, (ix) any increase in the amount of such Obligations beyond any limits imposed herein or in the amount of any interest, fees or other charges payable in connection therewith, or any decrease in the same, (x) the disallowance of all or any portion of the Administrative Agent s or any Lender s claims against Allied B.V. for the repayment of any of such Obligations under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (xi) any other circumstance that might constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of Allied B.V.  After the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may proceed directly and at once, without notice to the Company, against the Company to collect and recover all or any part of such Obligations, without first proceeding against Allied B.V. or against any Collateral or other security for the payment or performance of any of such Obligations, and the Company waives any provision under applicable Laws that might otherwise require the Administrative Agent to pursue or exhaust its remedies against any Collateral or Allied B.V. before pursing the Company.  The Company consents and agrees that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Allied B.V. or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. 
     
  (c)            Each Borrower hereby subordinates any claims, including any right of payment, subrogation, contribution and indemnity, that it may have from or against any other Borrower, and any successor or assign of any other Borrower, including any trustee, trustee in bankruptcy receiver or debtor-in-possession, howsoever arising, due or owing or whether heretofore, now or hereafter existing, to the payment in full of all Loans, fees and any other Obligations owing to or for the account of any one or more Lenders. 
     
   10.21                  Keepwell  .  Each Domestic Loan Party that is a Qualified ECP Guarantor at the time any Guaranty or the grant of a Lien under the Loan Documents, in each case, by any Specified Loan Party becomes effective with respect to any Swap Obligation, hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other 
     
 117   

support to each Specified Loan Party with respect to such Swap Obligation as may be needed by such Specified Loan Party from time to time to honor all of its obligations under the Loan Documents in respect of such Swap Obligation (but, in each case, only up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP Guarantor s obligations and undertakings voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).  The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full.  Each Domestic Loan Party intends this Section to constitute, and this Section shall be deemed to constitute, a guarantee of the obligations of, and a  keepwell, support, or other agreement  for the benefit of, each Specified Loan Party for all purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.  
     
   10.22                  Contractual Recognition of Bail-In  .  Notwithstanding any other term of any Loan Document or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding between any party to this Agreement (each a   Party  ), each Party acknowledges and accepts that any liability of any Party that is an EEA Financial Institution to any other Party under or in connection with the Loan Documents may be subject to Bail-In Action by the relevant Resolution Authority and acknowledges and accepts to be bound by the effect of: 
     
  (a)            any Bail-In Action in relation to any such liability, including (without limitation): 
     
  (i)                a reduction, in full or in part, in the principal amount, or outstanding amount due (including any accrued but unpaid interest) in respect to any such liability;  
     
  (ii)               a conversion of all, or part of, any such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership that may be issued to, or conferred on, it; and  
     
  (iii)              a cancellation of any such liability; and  
     
   (b)            a variation of any term of any Loan Document to the extent necessary to give effect to any Bail-In Action in relation to any such liability.
