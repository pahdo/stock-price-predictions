(UNAUDITED) 

NOTE 1- ORGANIZATION 

Nanning
Tongji Hospital, Inc. ("NTH") was established in Nanning in the
province of Guangxi of the People s Republic of China ("PRC"
or  China ) by the Nanning Tongji Medical Co. Ltd. and
an individual on October 30, 2003. 

NTH is
a designated hospital for medical insurance in the city of Nanning
and Guangxi province. NTH specializes in the areas of internal
medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, emergency medicine,
ophthalmology, medical cosmetology, rehabilitation, dermatology,
otolaryngology, traditional Chinese medicine, medical imaging,
anesthesia, acupuncture, physical therapy, health examination, and
prevention. 

On
December 19, 2006, NTH filed the Articles of Incorporation in the
State of Nevada to establish Tongji Healthcare Group, Inc. (the
"Company"). On the same day, Tongji, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company, was incorporated in the State of
Colorado. Tongji Inc. was later dissolved on March 25,
2011. 

On
December 27, 2006, Tongji Inc. acquired 100% of the equity in NTH
pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which NTH
became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tongji Inc. Pursuant to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Company issued 15,652,557 shares
of common stock to the stockholders of NTH in exchange for 100% of
the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of NTH.
Thereafter and for purposes of these consolidated financial
statements the "Company" and "NTH" are used to refer to the
operations of NTH. The acquisition of NTH was accounted for as a
reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting since
the stockholders of NTH obtained control of the consolidated
entity. Accordingly, the reorganization of the two companies was
recorded as a recapitalization of NTH, with NTH being treated as
the continuing operating entity. 

The
Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share and 20,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share. 

According
to the PRC Regulation of Healthcare Institutions, hospitals are
subject to registration with the health department of the local
government to obtain business license for hospital services. We
received our renewed business license from Nanning municipal
government in November 2007, and this license is valid until
November, 2020. Other existing regulations having material effects
on our business include regulations dealing with physician's
licensing, usage of medicine and injection, and public security in
health and medical advertising. 

NTH
must register with and maintain an operating license from the local
health department, due to the fact that NTH currently maintains a
facility with over 100 beds. NTH is subject to review by the local
health department at least once every three years. If NTH fails to
meet their standards, NTH s business license may be revoked.
NTH is also obligated to provide free services or dispatch our
physicians or other employees in the event of a need for public
assistance. NTH dedicates a very small percentage of its resources
to providing free public services.

(UNAUDITED) 

NOTE 2- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared by management without audit pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles have been condensed or omitted as allowed by
such rules and regulations, and management believes that the
disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading. These condensed consolidated financial statements
include all of the adjustments, which, in the opinion of
management, are necessary to a fair presentation of financial
position and results of operations. All such adjustments are of a
normal and recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily
indicative of results for a full year. The condensed consolidated
balance sheet information as of December 31, 2015 was derived from
the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Form
10-K. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited financial statements in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended on December 31, 2015 ( Form 10-K ), filed with
the Commission on April 16, 2016. 

This
summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is
presented to assist in understanding the Company s
consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial
statements and notes are representations of the Company s
management, which is responsible for their integrity and
objectivity. These accounting policies conform to generally
accepted accounting principles and have been consistently applied
in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial
statements and the Form 10-K. 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION 

These
financial statements present the Company s results of
operations, financial position and cash flows on a consolidated
basis. The consolidated financial statements include the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and
accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Our policy is to
consolidate all subsidiaries in which a greater than 50% voting
interest is owned. The Company operates in one segment in
accordance with the accounting guidance FASB ASC topic 280,
 Segment Reporting . 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

For
purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. A substantial amount of the
Company s cash is held in bank accounts in the PRC and is not
protected by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance
or any other similar insurance. Cash held in China amounted to
$43,507 as of September 30, 2016. Given the current economic
environment and the financial condition of the banking industry,
there is a risk that the deposits may not be readily available or
covered by such insurance. The Company has had no loss of cash in
domestic or foreign banks in past years. 

USE OF ESTIMATES 

The
preparation of these consolidated financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
net revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be
material. The more significant estimates and assumptions by
management include, among others, useful lives and residual values
of fixed assets, valuation of inventories, accounts receivable,
stock based compensation, and allowance for bad debt. The current
economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty
inherent in these estimates and assumptions.

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT 

The
Company's functional currency is the Chinese Renminbi (RMB). The
reporting currency is that of the US Dollar. Capital accounts of
the consolidated financial statements are translated into United
States dollars from RMB at their historical exchange rates when the
capital transactions occurred. Assets and liabilities are
translated at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date.
Income and expenditures are translated at the average exchange rate
of the year. The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign
currency and all foreign currency exchange transactions must take
place through authorized institutions. No representation is made
that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into
US dollar at the rates used in translation. 

The
exchange rates used to translate amounts in RMB into USD for the
purposes of preparing the financial statements were as
follows: 

RECLASSIFICATIONS 

Certain
items previously reported under specific financial statement
captions have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

The
Company's revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin 104 (ASC 605). Service revenue is recognized on
the dates services were rendered. When a formal arrangement exists,
the price is fixed or determinable. When the service is completed,
no other significant obligations of the Company exist and
collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all
of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are
recorded as unearned revenue.

The
Company generates revenue from individual patients as well as
third-party payers, including PRC government programs and insurance
providers, under which the hospital is paid based upon government
established charges. Revenues for pharmaceutical drug sales are
recognized upon the drug being administered to a
patient. 

Patient
revenues are recorded based on pre-established rates set by the
local government. The Company bills for services provided to
Medicare patients through a medical card (the US equivalent of an
insurance card). There have not been significant differences
between the amounts the Company has billed the government Medicare
funds and the amounts collected from the Medicare
funds. 

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 

Accounts
receivable are recorded at the estimated net realizable amounts
from government fund, insurance companies and patients. Collections
have not been considered an area that exposes the Company to
additional risk. Hospital staff verifies patient coverage prior to
examinations and/or procedures. 

For any
Medicare patient who visits the hospital and is qualified for
acceptance, the hospital will only include the portion that the
social insurance organization will pay in the accounts receivable
and collects the self-pay portion in cash at the time of service.
Management continues to estimate the likelihood of bad debt on an
ongoing basis. 

The
Company has estimated a bad debt allowance of approximately $29,000
and $30,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. 

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The
Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 825, which
requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial
instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not
recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to
estimate fair value, and defines fair value of a financial
instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged
in a current transaction between willing parties. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the fair value of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses, notes payable and other payables approximated the
carrying value due to the short maturity of the instruments, quoted
market prices or interest rates which fluctuate with market rates
except for related party debt or receivables for which it is not
practicable to estimate fair value. 

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

FASB
ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures , establishes a framework for measuring fair
value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair
value measurements. 

Various
inputs are considered when determining the fair value of the
Company s investments, and long-term debt. The inputs or
methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in these
securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels
listed below. 

Level 1
  observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices
for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2
  other significant observable inputs (including quoted
prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk,
etc.). 

Level 3
  significant unobservable inputs (including the
Company s own assumptions in determining the fair value of
investments).

NOTE 2- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES   -
continued  

The
carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair
value is measured on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Financial
assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those
that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs.
The Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and
measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods.
Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are
those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial
statement is prepared. The Company had no financial assets and
liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring
basis. 

The
availability of inputs observable in the market varies from
instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors
including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is
actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the
transaction. For many financial instruments, pricing inputs are
readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is
widely accepted by market participants, and the valuation does not
require significant management discretion. For other financial
instruments, pricing inputs are less observable in the market and
may require management judgment. 

CONCENTRATIONS, RISKS, AND UNCERTAINTIES 

All of
the Company s operations are located in the PRC. There can be
no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully continue
to operate and failure to do so would have a material adverse
effect on the Company s financial position, results of
operations and cash flows. In addition, the success of the
Company s operations is subject to numerous contingencies,
some of which are beyond management s control. These
contingencies include general economic conditions, the price of
medicine, competition, governmental and political conditions, and
changes in regulations. Because the Company is dependent on the
domestic market of the PRC, the Company is subject to various
additional political, economic and other uncertainties. Among other
risks, the Company s operations will be subject to risk of
restrictions on the transfer of funds, domestic policy changes,
changing taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, and
political and governmental regulations. 

CONTINGENCIES 

Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial
statements are issued. These conditions may result in a future loss
to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more
future events occur or fail to occur. The Company s
management and legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities,
and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In
assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are
pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in
such proceedings, the Company s legal counsel evaluates the
perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as
well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or
expected to be sought. 

If the
assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a
material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can
be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued. If the
assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is
not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot
be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together
with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and
material would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered to be
remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they
involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be
disclosed.

NOTE 2- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

MEDICAL SUPPLIES 

Medical
supplies include both western and traditional Chinese medicine, are
valued on the lower of weighted average cost or market basis.
Inventory includes product cost and inbound freight. Management
compares the cost of medical supplies with the market value and
allowance is made for writing down their inventories to market
value, if such value is lower. 

EQUIPMENT 

Equipment
is recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed over the estimated
useful lives of the related asset type using the straight-line
method. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and the
costs of additions and betterments that increase the useful lives
of the assets are capitalized. When equipment is disposed, the cost
and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and any gain or loss is included in other income or
expenses. 

CONSTRUCTION-IN-PROGRESS 

A
hospital facility currently under development is accounted for as
construction-in-progress. Construction-in-progress is recorded at
acquisition cost, including land rights cost, development
expenditure, and professional fees capitalized during the course of
construction for the purpose of financing the project. Upon
completion of the project, the cost of construction-in-progress
will be transferred to fixed assets, at which time depreciation
will commence. 

CAPITALIZATION OF INTEREST 

Interest
cost is capitalized for qualifying assets when the portion of the
interest cost incurred during the assets' acquisition periods could
have been avoided if expenditures for the assets had not been made.
The amount capitalized in an accounting period is determined by
applying the capitalization rate to the average amount of
accumulated expenditures for the asset during the period. The
capitalization rates used in an accounting period is based on the
rates applicable to borrowings outstanding during the period (also
see Note 4). 

Capitalization
period covers the duration of the activities required to get the
asset ready for its intended use, provided that expenditures for
the asset have been made and interest cost is being incurred.
Interest capitalization continues as long as those activities and
the incurrence of interest cost continue.  

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS 

The
Company s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment in
accordance with the guidance of FASB Topic ASC 360,
 Property, Plant, and Equipment , and FASB ASC Topic
205  Presentation of Financial Statements . The Company
tests for impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Whenever any
such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for
the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair
value. 

The Company tests
long-lived assets for recoverability at least annually or more
frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances
indicate that the net carrying amount is greater than its fair
value. Assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for
their identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the
cash flows of other groups of assets. The Companyconsiders
historical performance and future estimated results in its
evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying
amount of the asset to the future estimated cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the
asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows,
the Company measures the amount of impairment by comparing the
carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. The estimation of
fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future
cash flows at the rate the Company utilizes to evaluate potential
investments. The Company estimates fair value based on the
information available in making whatever estimates, judgments and
projections are considered necessary. There were no impairment
losses for the nine months ended September 30,
2016.

per share (EPS) is calculated in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic
260,  Earnings Per Share.  Basic net income (loss) per
share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share is based on the
assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options
were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the
treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are
assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the
time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were
used to purchase common stock at the average market price during
the period. Potentially dilutive securities to purchase 100,000
shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of the
diluted earnings per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the nine month
period ended September 30, 2016, the average market price of the
common stock was less than the exercise price of the stock options
and the Company was in net loss position. Accordingly, the stock
options were anti-dilutive and have not been included in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share. 

INCOME TAXES 

FASB
ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes  requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in the financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes
are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on
enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods
in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be
realized. 

In
accordance with ASC Topic 740-10,  Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes   An Interpretation of FASB ASC Topic
740  ,  which requires
income tax positions to meet a more-likely-than-not recognition
threshold to be recognized in the financial statements. Tax
positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not
threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial
reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously
recognized tax positions that no longer meet the
more-likely-than-not threshold should be derecognized in the first
subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no
longer met. 

The
application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and
factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and
regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes
in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of
regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability may
be materially different from our estimates, which could result in
the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially
reverse previously recorded tax liabilities or deferred tax asset
valuation allowance.   

The
Company has made a comprehensive review of its portfolio of tax
positions in accordance with recognition standards established by
ASC 740-10 and has not recognized any material uncertain tax
positions. 

In
addition, companies in the PRC are required to pay business taxes
consisting of 5% of income they derive from providing medical
treatment, as well as city construction taxes and educational taxes
which are 7% and 3%, respectively, of the business taxes. In April
2010, the Company was granted an exemption from these taxes until
further notice from the tax bureau. 

The
Company had accrued approximately $40,000 for failure to file US
tax returns and Form 5472 between the years 2006 to 2009. The
Company is current with its required filings. In addition, the
Company does not accrue United States income taxes on unremitted
earnings from foreign operations, as it is the Company s
intention to invest these earnings in the foreign operations
indefinitely.

 Compensation      Stock
Compensation,      we perform an
analysis of current market data and historical Company data to
calculate an estimate of implied volatility, the expected term of

the expected forfeiture rate, which is not an input, we use these
estimates as variables in the Black Scholes model. Depending upon
the number of stock options granted, any fluctuations in these
calculations could have a material effect on the results presented
in our consolidated statement of operations. In addition, any
differences between estimated forfeitures and actual forfeitures
could also have a material impact on our financial

Stock-based
compensation costs that have been included in operating expenses
amounted to $0 and $0, for the nine month periods ended September

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME 

The
Company reports comprehensive income in accordance with FASB ASC
Topic 220  Comprehensive Income," which established standards
for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its
components in a financial statement that is displayed with the same
prominence as other financial statements. 

Total
comprehensive income is defined as all changes in stockholders'
equity during a period, other than those resulting from investments
by and distributions to stockholders (i.e., issuance of equity
securities and dividends). Generally, for the Company, total
comprehensive income (loss) equals net income (loss) plus or minus
adjustments for currency translation.  Total comprehensive income (loss)
represents the activity for a period net of related tax and was a
loss of $92,842 and $37,724 for the three month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Total
comprehensive income (loss) represents the activity for a period
net of related tax and was a loss of $170,401 and 198,074 for the
nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

While
total comprehensive income is the activity in a period and is
largely driven by net earnings in that period, accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss ( AOCI ) represents the
cumulative balance of other comprehensive income as of the balance
sheet date. For the Company, AOCI is primarily the cumulative
balance related to the currency adjustments and increased overall
equity by $321,731 and $236,115 as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively.

a material effect on the Company s present or future
consolidated financial statements.  

GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a
going concern. However, the Company has negative working capital of

equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies,
and achieve profitable operations. The consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or
amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with
our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related
condensed notes included elsewhere in this report. Our financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The
following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results
could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements. 

Overview 

Nanning
Tongji Hospital, Inc. ("NTH" or  Tongji Hospital ) was
established in Nanning city Guangxi province of the Peoples 
Republic of China ("PRC") by the Guangxi Tongji Medical Co. Ltd.
and an individual on October 30, 2003. 

NTH is
a designated hospital for medical insurance in the city of
Nanning and Guangxi province. NTH specializes in the areas of
internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, emergency
medicine, ophthalmology, medical cosmetology, rehabilitation,
dermatology, otolaryngology, traditional Chinese medicine, medical
imaging, anesthesia, acupuncture, physical therapy, health
examination, and prevention. 

On
December 27, 2006, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tongji,
Inc., a Colorado company, acquired 100% of the equity in NTH
pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger. We issued 15,652,557
shares of common stock to the shareholders of NTH in exchange for
100% of the issued and outstanding shares of NTH. Accordingly, NTH
became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tongji, Inc. We have been in
the business of operating hospitals and providing healthcare
services in Nanning, Guangxi province of the PRC. 

The
acquisition of NTH was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under
the purchase method of accounting since the shareholders of NTH
obtained control of the consolidated entity. Accordingly, the
reorganization of the two companies was recorded as a
recapitalization of NTH. We treated NTH as the continuing operating
entity.   We have two sources of operating revenues:
in-patient service revenues and out-patient service revenues. In
addition to provide services to our patients, we also sell
pharmaceutical drugs to our patients. Revenues from such sales are
included in either our in-patient service revenues or our
out-patient service revenues. Our revenues come from individuals as
well as third-party payers, including PRC government programs and
insurance providers, under which the hospital is paid based upon
local government established charges. Revenues are recorded at
estimated net amounts due from patients or third-party payers.
Revenues from pharmaceutical drug sales are recognized upon the
drug being administered to a patient or at the time a prescription
by a registered physician is filled. 

Patient
revenues are recorded based on pre-established rates set by the
local government. The Company bills for services provided to
Medicare patients through a medical card (the US equivalent of an
insurance card). Historically, there have been no significant
differences between the amounts the Company has billed the
government Medicare funds and the amounts collected from the
Medicare funds. 

We had two major customers for the nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015: Nanning Social Insurance Center
accounted for 14% and 19% of revenue for the nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Guangxi Province
Social Insurance Center accounted for 3% and 2% of revenue for the
nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
As of September 30, 2016, accounts receivable due from Nanning
Social Insurance Center and Guangxi Province Social Insruance
Center were approximately $193,076 and $27,354,
respectively.  

The Company purchases the majority of its medicine
supplies from Liuzhou Guangxi Medicine Co., Ltd. Medicine purchased
from them accounted for 45% and 0% of all medicine purchases for
nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  The
rest are from around 12 different suppliers, which include
Sinopharm Medicine Holding Nanning Co., Ltd.,accounted for 21%,
Shanghai Shirui Medical Equipment Co., Ltd, accounted for 13%,
Shenzhen Songzhi Health Technology Co. Ltd., accounted for 8%,
Quanlikang Medical Equipment Guangxi Nanning Co., Ltd., accounted
for 6%, Nanning Aoya Technology Co., Ltd., accounted for 5%,
Jiangsu Lianxin Medical Equipment Co., Ltd., accounted for 2%, and
the rest 6 vendors accounted for a total of 1% for the nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.   - continued   

Difference in the Medical System between the U.S. and
China 

In the
United States most hospitals have contracts with health insurance
companies that provide reduced rates for healthcare services for
patients with health insurance. Medicare and Medicaid patients also
receive reduced rates. Functionally, the patient is billed for
health services at the higher rate normally charged to patients
without insurance. The amount billed is then reduced by the charges
paid by the insurance carrier and by the difference (sometimes
known as the "contractual allowance") between the normal rate for
the services and the reduced rate that the hospital estimates it
will receive from Medicare, Medicaid and insurance
companies. 

For
financial reporting purposes, hospitals in the United States record
revenues based upon established billing rates less adjustment for
contractual allowances. Revenues are recorded based upon the
amounts due from the patients and third-party payers, including
federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid
programs) managed care health plans, health insurance companies,
and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances under
third-party payer arrangements are based upon the payment terms
specified in the related contractual agreements. Third-party payer
contractual payment terms are generally based upon predetermined
rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, or discounted fee-for-service
rates. 

Due to
the complexities involved in determining amounts ultimately due
under reimbursement arrangements with a large number of third-party
payers, which are often subject to interpretation, the
reimbursement actually received by U.S. hospitals for health care
services is sometimes different from their estimates. 

The
medical system in the PRC is different from that in the United
States. Private medical insurance is not generally available to the
PRC s population and as a result services and medications
provided by our hospital are usually paid by cash or by the
Medicare agencies of the Nanning municipal government and the
Guangxi provincial government. Our billing system automatically
calculates the reimbursements that we are entitled to base upon
regulations promulgated by these government agencies. We bill the
Medicare agencies directly for services provided to patients
covered by these Medicare programs. In addition, due to the fact
that rates are established by the government, there is no
difference between rates for patients covered by Medicare and
patients who pay cash. 

Since
we only deal with the Nanning municipal and the Guangxi provincial
Medicare agencies, we are familiar with their regulations
pertaining to reimbursements. As a result, there is normally no
material difference between the amounts we bill and the amounts we
receive for services provided to Medicare patients. 

Results of Operation - Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 

Material
changes of items in our Statement of Operations for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015, are discussed below. 

Operating Revenues -  Operating revenue for the three month
period ended September 30, 2016, which resulted primarily from
in-patient services and out-patient services, was $429,416, a
decrease of $ 136,958 or 24%, as compared with the operating
revenue of $566,374 for the same period of 2015. Our in-patient
service revenue was $244,572 for the three month period ended
September 30, 2016, as compared to $297,438 for the same period in
2015, a decrease of $ 52,866 or 18%. Our out-patient service
revenue was $184,844 for the three month period ended September 30,
2016, a decrease of $84,092 or 31% as compared to 268,936 for the
same period in 2015. The decrease in in-patient service revenue was
primarily due to price drop across the board of in-patient services
by Medicare agencies of the Nanning municipal government since
August 2016. The decrease of out-patient service was primarily due
to the closure of personnel medical care department and resignation
of doctors from our out-patient department, resulting in fewer
patients being treated. 

Cost of Revenue  - Cost of
revenue were $331,927 for the three month period ended September
30, 2016, a decrease of 23% as compared to $431,203 for the same
period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to aforementioned
decrease in service revenue.   

Operating Expenses -  Operating expenses were $175,086 for
the three month period ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 3%
as compared to $180,616 for the same period of 2015, primarily due
to the closure of personnel care department and fewer doctors that
resulted in significant decrease in payroll expenses. 

Loss from Operations - Operating  loss was $77,597 for
the three month period ended September 30, 2016, an increase of
$32,152 or 71% as compared to an operating loss of $45,445 for the
same period of 2015. The primary reason for the increased operating
loss is   primarily due to a
significant decrease in revenue.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.   - continued  

Interest Expense -  Interest expense for the three month
period ended September 30, 2016 was $31,849 as compared to $71,381
for the three month period ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of
$39,532 or 55%.  The
decrease was primarily due to a decrease in related party
borrowings to fund the new hospital
construction.  

Net Loss  -    As a result of the
forgoing, the Company had a net loss of $103,240 during the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $101,520 for
the comparative period in 2015, an increase of $1,720 or
2%.  

Results of Operation - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015  

Material
changes of items in our Statement of Operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, are discussed below.   

Operating Revenues -  Operating revenue for the nine month
period ended September 30, 2015, which resulted primarily from
in-patient service and out-patient service, was $1,490,342, a
decrease of $275,106 or 16%, as compared with the operating revenue
of $1,765,448 for the same period of 2015. Our in-patient service
revenue was $835,871 for the nine month period ended September 30,
2016, as compared to $760,828 for the same period in 2015, an
increase of $75,043 or 10%. The increase in the in-patient service
revenue was primarily due to extended service hours offered in some
of in-patient department.  Our out-patient service
revenue was $654,471 for the nine month period ended September 30,
2016, a decrease of $350,149 or 35% as compared to $1,004,620 for
the same period in 2015. The decrease in the out-patient service
revenue was primarily due to closure of the personnel medical care
department and resignation of doctors from out-patient department
resulted in fewer clients being treated.    

Cost of Revenue    Cost of revenue were $1,153,314 for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 12%
as compared to $1,309,205 for the same period of 2015. The decrease
was primarily due to aforementioned decrease in service
revenue. 

Operating Expenses -  Operating expenses were $491,236 for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 16%
as compared to $581,929 for the same period of 2015. The decrease
was primarily due to the decrease of approximately $90,000 in
administrative expenses.. 

Loss from
Operations - Operating loss was $154,208 for the nine month
period ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $28,522 or 23% as
compared to an operating loss of $125,686 for the same period of
2015. The primary reason for the decrease is the aforementioned
changes.     

Interest Expense -  Interest expense for the nine month
period ended September 30, 2016 was $122,237 as compared to
$169,051 for the nine month period ended September, 2015, a
decrease of $46,814 or 28%.    

Net Loss -  As a result of the forgoing, the Company had
a net loss of $256,017 during the nine month period ended September
30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $259,598 for the comparative
period in 2015, a slight decrease of $3,581 or 1%. 

Trends, Events and Uncertainties 

The
China Ministry of Health, as well as other related agencies, has
proposed changes to the price limit we can charge for medical
services, drugs and medications. We cannot predict the impact of
these proposed changes since the changes are not fully defined and
we do not know whether those proposed changes will be implemented
or when they may take effect. 

We are constructing a new hospital building on leased land. The
hospital building is being constructed by Guangxi Construction
Engineering Corporation Langdong 8th Group ( Langdong 8th
Group ). Costs capitalized primarily consists of payments for
construction costs, acquisition cost, land rights cost, development
expenditure, professional fees, and capitalized interest As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had paid approximately $15,003,983
for the construction of the hospital. In addition to what we had
paid for the hospital building construction, we estimate the
additional costs to complete the project to be $29,000,000. The
Company expects to seek to obtain additional funding through the
completion of additional equity, debt, or joint venture
transactions. The land lease term will start upon completion of the
new hospital construction. The new hospital is expected to be
completed by the end of 2017 subject to availability of
funds. 

23 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.   - continued  

We plan to acquire other hospitals and companies involved in the
healthcare industry in the PRC using cash and shares of our common
stock. Substantial capital may be needed for these acquisitions and
we may need to raise additional funds through the sale of our
common stock, debt financing or other arrangements. We do not have
any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with
any additional capital. Additional capital may not be available to
us, or if available, on acceptable terms, in which case we would
not be able to acquire other hospitals or businesses in the
healthcare industry.  

Other
than the factors listed above we do not know of any trends, events
or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a
material impact on our net sales or revenues or income from
continuing operations. Our business is not seasonal in
nature. 

Accounting Estimates 

In the
United States most hospitals have contracts with health insurance
companies that provide reduced rates for healthcare services for
patients with health insurance. Medicare and Medicaid patients also
receive reduced rates. Functionally, the patient is billed for
health services at the higher rate normally charged to patients
without insurance. The amount billed is then reduced by the charges
paid by the insurance carrier and by the difference (sometimes
known as the "contractual allowance") between the normal rate for
the services and the reduced rate that the hospital estimates it
will receive from Medicare, Medicaid and insurance
companies. 

For
financial reporting purposes, hospitals in the United States record
revenues based upon established billing rates less adjustment for
contractual allowances. Revenues are recorded based upon the
amounts due from the patients and third-party payers, including
federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid
programs) managed care health plans, health insurance companies,
and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances under
third-party payer arrangements are based upon the payment terms
specified in the related contractual agreements. Third-party payer
contractual payment terms are generally based upon predetermined
rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, or discounted fee-for-service
rates. 

Due to
the complexities involved in determining amounts ultimately due
under reimbursement arrangements with a large number of third-party
payers, which are often subject to interpretation, the
reimbursement actually received by U.S. hospitals for health care
services is sometimes different from their estimates. 

The
medical system in the PRC is different from that in the United
States. Private medical insurance is not generally available to the
PRC s population and as a result services and medications
provided by our hospital are usually paid for in cash or by the
Medicare agencies of the Nanning municipal government and the
Guangxi provincial government. Our billing system automatically
calculates the reimbursements that we are entitled to base upon
regulations promulgated by theses government agencies. We bill the
Medicare agencies directly for services provided to patients
covered by theses Medicare programs. In addition, due to the fact
that rates are established by the government, there is no
difference between rates for patients covered by Medicare and
patients who only use cash. 

Since
we only deal with the Nanning municipal and the Guangxi provincial
Medicare agencies we are familiar with their regulations pertaining
to reimbursements. As a result, there is normally no material
difference between the amounts we bill and
the    amounts we receive for services
provided to Medicare patients.    

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We
generally finance our operations through our operating profits and
borrowings from related parties. As of the date of this report, we
have not experienced any difficulty in raising funds from related
parties, and we have not experienced any liquidity problems in
settling our payables in our ordinary course of business. We
believe that we have adequate funds and capital with respect to
conducting its business over the next twelve months. 

24 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.   - continued  

The
following shows our material sources and uses of cash during the
nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The
Company carefully monitors and controls the amount of cash used to
fund operating activities. However, substantial funds are required
to fund the construction costs on the new hospital building and a
lawsuit settlement (see Note 5 to the Financial Statements
accompanying this Report). Financing of operations has come
primarily from advances from related parties. We are dependent on
related parties to provide working capital and pay our management
team until such time as our operations are profitable. There can be
no assurances that related parties will continue to provide
additional capital. Without additional capital, we may be forced to
cease operations and liquidate. 

Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities primarily consists of net loss,
as adjusted by depreciation, stock option, and changes in operating
assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable, medical
supplies, capital lease deposits, prepaid expense and other current
assets, accounts payables and accrued liabilities and other
payables. 

Net cash used in operating activities was $99,372 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $96,100 or 2937%,
as compared with the net cash used in operating activities of
$3,272 for the same period in 2015. The increase in net cash used
in operating activities was primarily due to a decrease of $95,197
in accounts payable that company paid their
vendors.   

Investing Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was $147,863 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $192, as compared with the
net cash used in investing activities of $148,055 for the same
period in 2015. The decrease in net cash used in investing
activities was primarily due to the decrease in construction in
progress and due from related parties. 

Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities primarily consists of
proceeds from related party loans. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $281,196 for the nine
months ended September 30, an increase of $53,256 or 23%, as
compared with the net cash provided by financing activities of
$227,940 for the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily
attributable to increase in funds advanced from related
party.  

Working Capital 

Our
working capital was negative $18,956,952 as of September 30, 2016,
as compared with negative $19,153,954 as of December 31, 2015, a
decrease of $197,002, which is primarily attributable to the
decrease in related party loan of approximately $170,011 and
decrease in other payables of $70,172. 

Rental Commitments 

On
March 1, 2016, the Company renewed the lease agreement for their
hospital with Guangxi Tongji Medicine Co. Ltd that expired in
December 2015. Monthly lease payment under the new lease is
approximately $4,800. The lease will expire on February 28, 2019.
The Company is also in the process of building a new 600-bed
hospital in Nanning, China. It expects the new hospital to be
completed by 2017. The hospital is being constructed by Guangxi
Construction Engineering Corporation Langdong 8th Group and, when
completed, the land on which the hospital is located will be leased
by the Company for a twenty-year term. The annual lease payments
will gradually increase each year. Based on the exchange rate at
September 30, 2016, minimum future lease payments are as
follows:

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.   - continued  

Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which
contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.
However, the Company has negative working capital of $18,956,952,
an accumulated deficit of $3,821,579, and a stockholders 
deficit of $3,043,668 as of September 30, 2016. The Company s
ability to continue as a going concern ultimately is dependent on
the management s ability to obtain equity or debt financing,
attain further operating efficiencies, and achieve profitable
operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not be able
to continue as a going concern. 

Management
has taken certain restructuring steps to provide the necessary
capital to continue its operations.   These steps included: 1) plan to
convert existing related party loans into equity, 2) plan to
complete construction of the new hospital and begin generating
revenue by 2017, 3) plan to increase sales revenue with additional
medical equipment, 4) plan to obtain more funding from
related party entity that is controlled by the CEO to complete the
construction of the new hospital. No assurances can be given that
the steps taken will provide necessary capital for the Company to
continue its operations.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do
not have any off-balance sheet items reasonably likely to have a
material effect on our financial condition. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk. 

Not
applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls 

Our
management maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), that are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the material
information required to be disclosed by us in our periodic reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

26 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   - continued    

As of
September 30, 2016, our management, under the supervision of and
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as required by Rules 13a-15(b) and
15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
September 30, 2016 as a result of the material weaknesses
identified in our internal control over financial reporting, which
are discussed below. Our management considers our internal control
over financial reporting to be an integral part of our disclosure
controls and procedures. 

Specifically,
our management identified certain matters involving internal
control and our operations that it considered to be material
weaknesses. As defined in the Exchange Act, a material weakness is
a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control
over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant's annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified by our
management as of September 30, 2016, are described
below: 

We did
not design, implement, or maintain effective entity-level controls
related to our control environment, resulting in the following
significant control deficiencies: 

o 

The
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which was specifically
designed for public company applicability, has yet to be formally
acknowledged by members of management and the finance
department. 

o 

There
is an absence of independence and financial expertise on the Board
of Directors, and we do not have an Audit Committee or a formalized
internal audit function, limiting its ability to provide effective
oversight of our management. 

o 

The
full implementation of, and related training for, our
newly-formalized IT policies and procedures were still in process
at year-end. Accordingly, we lacked sufficiently-trained personnel
to provide for adequate segregation of duties within the accounting
system and effective oversight of controls over access, change,
data, and security management. 

2016 Planned Remediation 

As
financial conditions permit, we plan to take the following actions
to improve our internal control over financial
reporting. 

Require
all members of our management and the finance department across all
corporate entities to certify receipt of the revised Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics by signature. Signed copies will be
retained by our management. Thereafter, our management plans to
periodically require signatories to acknowledge that they
understand the contents of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics,
and whether they are aware of anyone in our Company that might have
violated some part of the Code. 

Recruit
an independent financial expert to the Board of Directors to chair
an Audit Committee and formalize roles and responsibilities over
our internal control over financial reporting for the Board and our
management. Our management also plans to develop and implement a
formal corporate internal audit capability, reporting directly to
an independent Audit Committee, to provide effective oversight of
our internal control over financial reporting. 

Continue
to engage the services of qualified consultants with China GAAP,
U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience to support our financial
reporting and SOX compliance requirements, including assistance
with the following: 

27 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 -
continued     

o 

Remediating
identified material weaknesses; 

o 

Monitoring
our internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing
basis; 

o 

Managing
our period-end financial closing and reporting processes;
and 

o 

Identifying
and resolving non-routine or complex accounting
matters. 

Complete
the implementation of, and related training for, its IT policies
and procedures related to access, change, data, and security
management to ensure that all relevant financial information is
secure, identified, captured, processed, and reported within the
accounting system and spreadsheets supporting financial
reporting. 

Continue
providing training to accounting personnel regarding our
significant policies and procedures related to accounting, finance,
and internal control to ensure that financial reporting
competencies are strengthened. 

Our
management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness
of its disclosure controls and procedures, as well as its internal
control over financial reporting, on an ongoing basis, and is
committed to taking further action and implementing additional
improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. However, our
management cannot guarantee that the measures taken or any future
measures will remediate the material weaknesses identified or that
any additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will
not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain
adequate internal control over financial reporting. 

Notwithstanding
the material weaknesses described above, our management believes
that there are no material inaccuracies or omissions of material
fact and, to the best of its knowledge, believes that the
consolidated financial statements included in this annual report
present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No
changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting
has come to management's attention during the Company's last fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are likely to materially
affect, the Company's internal control over financial
reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.   
Legal Proceedings. 

In
September 2009, Guangxi Nanning Tingyouyuxiang Commercial Co., Ltd.
( Tingyouyuxiang ) filed a civil suit against Nanning
Tongji Hospital, Inc. ( NTH ), a subsidiary of the
Company in the People s Court. In the complaint,
Tingyouyuxiang asserted a breach of contract claim against NTH,
alleging that NTH had failed to make timely and total payment of
RMB 5,050,000 (approximately $800,000)  under certain
Supplement Agreement by and among NTH, Tingyouyuxiang and the
Eighth Group of Langdong Village Committee, Nanhu Community Office,
Qingxiu District, Nanning City (the  Village

ruled that NTH shall pay to Tingyouyuxiang damages of RMB 5,050,000
(approximately $800,000) plus interest and the court hearing fee
approximately $320,000. On March 9, 2013, NTH appealed to the

never served. On September 6, 2013, the Intermediate Court remanded
the case to the People s Court.    On April 16, 2014, the Intermediate
Court dismissed Tingyouyuxiang s appeal and affirmed the
decision of the People s Court. Upon settlement of the
lawsuit, the Company had accrued approximately $1,399,990 in
settlement payable as of  September 30,

I, Yunhui Yu,
certify that: 

1. I have reviewed
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Tongji Healthcare Group,
Inc. 

2. Based on my
knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such
statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
covered by this report; 

3. Based on my
knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
information included in this report, fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in
this report; 

4. The
registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible
for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and
have: 

a) designed such
disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to
ensure that material information relating to the registrant,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by
others within those entities, particularly during the period in
which this report is being prepared; 

b) designed such
internal controls over financial reporting, or caused such internal
control over financial reporting to be designed under our
supervision, to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles; 

c) evaluated the
effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and
procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the
end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;
and 

d) disclosed in
this report any change in the registrant s internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the
registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the
registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual
report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the registrant s internal control over
financial reporting; and 

5. The
registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed,
based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the
audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or
persons performing the equivalent functions): 

a) all significant
deficiencies and material weakness in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data;
and 

b) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
internal control over financial reporting.
