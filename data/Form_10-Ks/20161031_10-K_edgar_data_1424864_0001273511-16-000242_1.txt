  Business  
   
   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   
             
   General   
   
 The Company is a mineral exploration company and its primary asset is a copper/gold property under option. The Company s common stock is currently traded on the OTC Markets under the symbol  RYES , and listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the  CSE ) under the symbol  UPP .   The Company ceased to be an OTC reporting issuer in Canada on February 2, 2016.  
   
 On May 18, 2015, the Company entered into an option agreement (the  Option Agreement ) with Eastfield Resources Ltd., a British Columbia company with its common shares listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol  ETF  ( Eastfield ), pursuant to which Eastfield granted the Company the exclusive and irrevocable option to acquire up to a 75% undivided interest in and to certain mineral claims known as the Indata property located in the Omineca Mining Division in British Columbia, Canada (the  Indata Property ).  In order to earn the initial 60% interest, the Company is required to pay Eastfield an aggregate of $350,000 in cash and incur a minimum of $2,000,000 in aggregate exploration expenditures on the Indata Property by April 3, 2019.   In order to earn the additional 15% interest, it is required to pay Eastfield $100,000 within 90 days of earning the 60% interest and incur a further $500,000 in aggregate annual exploration expenditures on the  Indata  Property until such time as the Company is able to complete a feasibility study on the property.  Upon the completion of a feasibility study, the additional 15% interest will be deemed to have been earned.  
   
 Prior to entering into the Option Agreement, the Company was a development stage company engaged in exploring and evaluating potential strategic transactions in multiple industries, including but not limited to mineral properties and technology. 
   
 On May 31, 2016, the Company entered into a property purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Klondike Gold Corp., a British Columbia company with its common shares listed for trading on the TSX Venture  

5 

Exchange under the symbol  KG  ( Klondike ), regarding the purchase of a portfolio of seven gold and base metal properties in southeast British Columbia   consisting of 150 mining claims with a total area of 28,000 hectares (collectively, the  Klondike Properties ).  Under the Purchase Agreement, on July 13, 2016 (the  First Closing ), the Company paid Klondike $50,000 in cash, issued 1,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock, and issued 1,500,000 warrants exercisable at a price of $0.227 per share until July 13, 2018.  On the one year anniversary of the First Closing, the Company is required to pay Klondike $150,000 in cash, issue 2,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, and issue 1,000,000 warrants.  Klondike will retain a 2% net smelter return royalty ( NSR ) and the Company will have the right to purchase 50% of the NSR for $1,000,000 at any time after the First Closing.  Each of the warrants is exercisable for a period of two years into one share of the Company s common stock at a price that is a 20% premium to the 10-day volume-weighted average price of the stock on the CSE immediately prior to the date of issuance. 
   
 On August 30, 2016, the Company entered into an option agreement with three parties to purchase an undivided 100% interest in and to certain mineral lands and surface rights in the United States (the  US Property ).  A significant historic gold mine is located on the US Property, which consists solely of private land.  Upon the execution of the option agreement, the Company paid the vendors a non-refundable cash deposit in the amount of USD$25,000, and an additional cash payment of US$2,000,000 is required to exercise the option. 
 The Company believes it can prepare a mineral resource estimate, exploration plan, and a preliminary mine plan through processing historic data on the US Property within two months of the closing of the purchase. 
 On October 6, 2016, the Company announced a non-brokered private placement of up to 17,500,000 units at a price of $0.20 per unit for gross proceeds of up to $3,500,000 (the  Private Placement ).  Each unit will consist of one share of the Company s common stock and one-half of a transferable share purchase warrant, with each whole warrant exercisable into one share of common stock at a price of $0.40 for a period of two years from the date of issuance.  The Company expects to use the proceeds from the Private Placement for the exercise of the option on the US Property, of which there is no guarantee, and for general working capital purposes.

  Indata Property  
   
  Location and Means of Access  
   
 The Indata Property is situated in north-central British Columbia on the east side of Albert Lake, two kilometres west of the north end of Indata Lake.  It is approximately 130 kilometres northwest of the community of Fort St James and 230 kilometres northwest of the city of Prince George.  The Indata Property is located in the Omineca Mining Division of British Columbia. 
   
 The Indata Property is roughly centered on UTM coordinates 351900E / 6141200N (datum NAD 83 Zone 10) and 55 23 N / 125 19, West latitude / longitude on NTS sheets 093N034 and 035. The Indata Property location is shown in Figure 1 below.

Figure 1: General Location Map 

Access to the Indata Property is from Fort St. James via the Leo Creek Forestry Road to near Tchentlo Lake and then on a road built by Eastfield to the northern part of the Indata Property.  This road was built to British Columbia Ministry of Forests  logging road standards and provides good access for trucks and heavy machinery  

12 

such as drill rigs and bulldozers.  Driving time from Fort St. James to the Indata Property is approximately two hours.  Smaller haul and tote roads have been constructed from the main road to other areas of the Indata Property.  Away from the roads, access is on foot only except for a few areas where helicopter landing sites have been prepared. 
   
 All of the land within the Indata Property is held by the Crown, and there are no permanent structures in the area. 
   
  Description of the Indata Property  
   
 The Indata Property consists of 18 mineral claims totaling 3,170.03 hectares and is situated in a complex geological setting adjacent to the Pinchi Fault, a major structure separating the Cache Creek and Quesnel Terranes.  All of the claims that comprise the Indata Property are in good standing according to Mineral Titles Online ( British Columbia s internet-based electronic mineral titles administration system).  Importantly,  a holder of mineral claims in British Columbia is not entitled to surface rights. 
   
 The characteristics of the 18 claims are as follows: 

The Nation Lakes Provincial Park abuts the Indata Property on its north and east sides and partially overlaps the claims.  However, the claims were staked prior to the creation of the park and the entirety of the claims area  

13 

remains valid.  On June 29, 2000, the Order in Council of the Government of British Columbia creating the Nation Lakes Park (published on April 9, 2003) specifically excluded the Schnapps #1 (238722), Schnapps #2 (238723), Schnapps #4 (238860), Indata #2 (239379) and Indata #3 (240192) mineral claims from the park, as is currently stipulated in the Protected Areas of British Columbia Act, Schedule D.  The park boundaries are included in Figure 2.

In British Columbia, a  Notice of Work  filed with the Department of Energy and Mines is generally required in order for exploration work to be carried out, though exceptions can be made for small programs with limited surface disturbance.  There is a current Notice of Work (#100038) filed on the Indata Property which allows for the installation of  Grids, Camps and Helicopter Pads ,  Access Construction, Modification or Reclamation , and seven holes of  Surface Drilling .  As a condition of granting this Notice of Work, an Archeological Review was requested and conducted.  This Notice of Work is valid until December 15, 2016.

History  
   
 The initial claims on the Indata Property were staked by Imperial in 1983, and in 1984, Imperial began to explore the Indata Property.  Following initial soil sampling and the staking of additional claims, a four-hole diamond drilling program was completed to explore copper mineralization observed in an outcrop near the northeast side of Albert Lake (the Lake Zone).  This program resulted in the discovery of low grade chalcopyrite mineralization including 9.3 metres of 0.20% Cu in one drill hole.  Hole depths were relatively shallow; to a maximum of 76.8 metres. 
   
 On March 3, 1986, Imperial sold the claims to Eastfield pursuant to a sale agreement that also covered the sale of other of Imperial properties, for a total sum of $1, subject to a number of terms that included the right of Imperial to acquire up to a 30% interest in the Indata Property at a later date. 
   
 In 1986, Eastfield undertook a program of grid establishment, soil sampling, hand trenching and geophysical surveying.  This was followed by diamond drilling in 1987, 1988 and 1989 and trenching with a bulldozer-mounted backhoe in 1989.  The drilling programs resulted in the discovery of polymetallic quartz and quartz-carbonate veins some 500 metres east of the copper mineralization.  These veins contained elevated precious metal values (commonly in the range of several hundred ppb gold to 6 g/t with the most significant intercept being 47 g/t gold over 4 metres).  The veins generally strike north and dip to the east, and are commonly enveloped by a zone of silicification in volcanic rocks and a thickening-downwards zone of talc-magnesite alteration in ultramafic rocks. 
   
 On February 25, 1988, Imperial acquired a 30% interest in the Indata Property from Eastfield and the two parties entered into a joint venture.  Imperial has not participated in exploration funding in recent years and its interest in the joint venture has therefore been diluted.  As of the date of this Report, it stands at 8.9%, while Eastfield retains the remaining 91.1%. 
   
 In 1988 a heavy mineral sampling program was conducted on streams on the claims.  Most results were unimpressive, even those that drained the area of the precious metal bearing polymetallic vein mineralization, except for an east draining creek which returned a value of 3360 ppb Au in the southeast corner of the Indata Property. 
   
 In 1995, after construction of an access road through the southern part of the Indata Property, built to standards for log haulage, a trenching program was completed near the northeast corner of Albert Lake, over the copper zone previously defined by soil sampling and the 1985 drilling.  One of these trenches returned analyses which averaged 0.36% copper over a length of 75 metres. 
   
 In 1996, Clear Creek Resources Limited ( Clear Creek ) carried out a small diamond drilling program in the copper zone northeast of Albert Lake.  Results confirmed the existence of copper mineralization identified in the 1985 drilling and encountered mineralization over significantly larger intervals: up to 97.5 metres of 0.12% Cu in one drill hole, and 21.0 metres of 0.23% Cu in another drill hole.  This program tested only a very small part of the area covered by anomalous soil copper geochemistry. 
   
 Clear Creek returned with another drill program in the copper zone area in 1998 which confirmed and exceeded the 1996 drilling results and also identified an altered granodiorite stock with copper mineralization adjacent to the eastern edge of Albert Lake.  A new zone of copper mineralization was also discovered in a fan of three holes: 98-I-4, 5 and 9, located 350 metres southeast of the previous drill intercepts, halfway to the zone of polymetallic veins.  Road construction exposed silicified volcanic rocks in a road cut in the southern part of the existing grid where grab samples showed the presence of copper sulfides along with enriched gold values, demonstrating for the first time an association of copper and gold on the Indata Property. 

15 

In 2000, a helicopter borne very low frequency (VLF) and magnetic survey was flown across the Indata Property.  A total of 595 east-west line kilometres were flown by Aerodat Ltd.  The data was later reprocessed by Furgo Airborne Surveys Corp.  No new exploration targets were derived from this work. 
   
 A program of linecutting, soil sampling and induced polarization surveying was completed in 2003, funded by Castillian Resources Corp., with 11.2 line kilometres of induced polarization survey completed and 16 line kilometers of soil grid expansions established, and 304 soil samples collected.  The bulk of this work was completed in the northwestern side of the currently explored area.  New anomalies consisting of anomalous arsenic and/or antimony soil values associated with a moderate induced polarization chargeability response were defined. 
   
 In 2005, two diamond drill holes were completed with a total meterage of 262 metres in a program funded by Aberdeen International Inc.  The first hole of the 2005 program, hole 2005-I-1, was designed to test below hole 98-I-4 which returned 145.4 metres grading 0.20% copper including 24.1 metres grading 0.37%.  Unfortunately, significant drilling difficulties were encountered and this hole was abandoned at a depth of 99.1 metres, approximately 50 metres short of the top of the target.  The rest of the 2005 drilling was located approximately 1400 metres to the south where hole 2005-I-03 encountered narrow intervals of anomalous copper mineralization in a dioritic intrusive.  Another hole designated 2005-I-02, located adjacent to 2005-I-03, was abandoned without successfully setting casing. 
   
 Soil sampling was conducted in 2007 to extend the grids to the west and north in the area north of the Lake Zone.  A zone of anomalous gold, arsenic, antimony and bismuth in soils was located in the northwest corner of the new sampling in an area underlain by recrystallized limestone which is in fault contact with volcanic rocks to the south (the  Northwest Soil Anomaly ).  A short excavator trenching program targeting 2003 induced polarization ( IP ) and soil anomalies discovered a new polymetallic quartz vein well to the west of those previously known. The 10 centimetre vein returned assay values of 17.16 and 7.84 g/t Au.  This work was funded by Redzone Resources Ltd. 
   
 Max Resource Corp. optioned the Indata Property in 2008 and funded a five hole 1056.2 metre diamond drill program, focusing mostly on the polymetallic vein zone.  Highlights included hole 08-I-2, which returned 8.20g/t Au over 0.3 metres and 08-I-3 which returned 209g/t Ag over 0.5 metres. 
   
 In 2010, the Indata Property was optioned to Oceanside Capital Corporation ( Oceanside ).  During that year a program of ground geophysics and soil sampling was conducted.  Four north-south lines totaling 5.4 kilometres were emplaced and an IP and magnetic survey was run along these.  One of the lines ran along the east side of the north end of Albert Lake across the area of the previously known copper in soil anomaly and where previous porphyry copper mineralization encountered in the 2005 drilling (the Lake Zone).  The other three lines tested the area of the strong gold, arsenic, antimony and bismuth in soil anomaly discovered in 2007 in the northwest part of the Indata Property (the Northwest Soil Anomaly). 
   
 A strong chargeability high was returned from the Lake Zone area, coincidental with the copper in soil anomaly.  Chargeability highs were also discovered in the northwest and southeast areas of the other three lines in the Northwest Soil Anomaly, roughly flanking a prominent ridge of recrystallized limestone. 
   
 Also in 2010, a total of 471 soil samples were collected.  The four IP lines were sampled and three other widely spaced reconnaissance type east-west lines were emplaced and sampled in the southern part of the Indata Property to the south of the existing grids.  The multi-element  epithermal-type  soil anomaly in the northwest part of the Indata Property was confirmed and spotty gold and copper anomalies were discovered on the southern lines. 
   
 The 2011 program was made up of an IP/magnetics survey along the three southern 2010 soil lines, which totaled 8.1 line kilometres.  Two north-south trending chargeability highs were encountered near the eastern end of the  

16 

two northern lines (L100N and L300S).  A strong copper in soil anomaly coincides with the western chargeability high on L100N.  The southernmost line (L1850S) is 1550 metres south of the other two lines and has three prominent chargeability highs. 
   
 In 2012, Oceanside and Eastfield constructed 3.2 kilometers of drill road access along with the construction of six drill sites.  Eighteen rock samples were collected during this work, one of which returned an analysis of 0.78% copper in dacitic volcanic float from a new road in the southern part of the Indata Property, in the area of the 2010-2011 soil sampling and geophysical work. 
   
 The 2013 program was focused on the southern part of the Indata Property in the area where the copper bearing float was discovered in 2012.  Minor prospecting and rock sampling was conducted and additional mineralized float and rubble was found in the area.  Three 1000 metre east-west soil lines were emplaced in the same area with samples collected at 50 metre intervals, to a total of 62 samples.  A number of localized copper anomalies were discovered.  As well, 17 silt samples were taken from a number of areas of the Indata Property.  A single high gold value was returned from a sample in the southeast corner of the Indata Property.  Subsequent to this work, Oceanside terminated its option on the Indata Property in October 2013. 
   
  Geologic Setting  
   
  Regional Geology  
   
 The Indata Property lies west of and along splay faults related to the contact of two major terranes of the Canadian Cordillera: the Quesnel and Cache Creek Terranes.  The contact between these terranes is marked by the Pinchi Fault Zone, a high angle reverse fault of regional extent, and associated splay faults where Cache Creek strata to the west have been thrust over Takla strata to the east.  The fault zone is up to 10 kilometres in width.  The regional geology of the Indata Property area is shown in Figure 3. 

17 

Figure 3: Indata Regional Geology 

18 

The Quesnel Terrane consists of mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks of the Upper Triassic   Lower Jurassic Takla Group intruded by the Hogem Batholith, which is composed of intrusive phases which range in composition from granite to monzonite to quartz syenite, which range in age from Lower Jurassic to Cretaceous. 
   
 The Cache Creek Terrane in the region comprises mainly argillaceous metasedimentary rocks intruded by diorite to granodiorite plutons (which may be pre-Triassic or Lower Cretaceous in age) and by small ultramafic stocks. Some of these latter intrusions may be of ophiolitic origin. 
   
 A northwest-striking fault bounded block situated between the two terranes (within the Pinchi Fault Zone) underlies the Indata Property.  This block is underlain largely by limestone within which a sliver of mafic and intermediate volcanic rocks is preserved.  Both the limestone and volcanic rocks are considered here to be part of the Cache Creek Group but the evidence for this is equivocal as similar strata occur within the Takla Group elsewhere in the region.  As well, the volcanic rocks in this block have been subjected to greenschist facies metamorphism, similar to what is normally found in Cache Creek rocks, whereas generally the metamorphic grade of the Takla Group volcanic rocks is rarely higher than zeolite facies.  But the area s proximity to such a major fault may locally have raised the metamorphic grade as has been demonstrated further to south along the Pinchi fault at Pinchi Lake where metamorphic grade increases to blueschist grade at the fault.  It is also possible that the major fault movements along the Pinchi Lake Fault have juxtaposed Cache Creek limestone against Takla volcanic rocks within this fault block. 
   
 The dominant structural style of the Takla Group is that of extensional faulting, mainly to the northwest.  In general Takla Group rocks are tilted but not folded.  In contrast, strata of the Cache Creek Group have been folded and metamorphosed to lower to middle greenschist facies and a penetrative deformational fabric has been preserved in argillaceous rocks.  Extensional faults are also common within the Cache Creek Group and probably represent the effects of post-collision uplift. 
   
  Property Geology  
   
 There are no comprehensive geological maps of the Indata Property.  A generalized map showing outcrop locations of the various lithologies is shown in Figure 4. 

19 

Figure 4: Indata Property Geology 

Lithologies  

20 

The Indata Property is underlain by two main supracrustal assemblages: limestone with minor intercalated shale; and andesitic volcanic rocks that were deposited under marine conditions.  As discussed above, it is uncertain whether these rocks belong to the Cache Creek or Quesnel Terranes. 
   
 Limestone crops out as prominent hills and bluffs in the northern, western and southern parts of the area.  Although generally massive, in places bedding is defined by thin shaley partings and by intraformational limestone conglomerate.  Breccias formed by carbonate dissolution are displayed within karst topography in the southwestern part of the Indata Property at the southern end of Albert Lake. 
   
 Volcanic rocks underlying the Indata Property are of andesitic composition and can be subdivided into two broad units.  In the western part of the Indata Property, volcanic rocks consist of pillow lava, pillow breccia, coarse tuff breccia and fine-grained crystal lithic tuff.  The dominant mafic mineral in these rocks is amphibole, now represented by tremolite/actinolite but was probably hornblende prior to alteration.  The second volcanic unit consists of massive to poorly bedded volcanic tuff with variable amounts of amphibole phenocrysts.  Although commonly poorly bedded, bedding planes and fining upwards sequences can be recognized in places. 
   
 Intrusive rocks recognized on the Indata Property range in composition from ultramafic to granite and underlie the central part of the Indata Property area.  Hornblende diorite occurs as a pluton which extends along part of the eastern side of the central part of the Indata Property and as dykes.  The bulk of this pluton has a fine to medium-grained hypidiomorphic granular texture although both marginal phases of the pluton and the dykes are porphyritic.  A small part of the pluton is of quartz diorite composition although primary quartz is generally absent.  While diorite dykes are common within the volcanic rocks of the Indata Property, no diorite intrusions have been observed within the limestone unit, suggesting that the diorite and volcanic rocks are of similar age and are either older than the massive limestone or that the limestone is allochthonous with respect to the volcanics and was emplaced adjacent to the volcanic strata after volcanism and plutonism had ceased. 
   
 Intruding both volcanic rocks and diorite are ultramafic bodies, serpentinite to varying degrees but which preserve textures suggesting that the original rocks were peridotite and pyroxenite.  Cross fibre chrysotile veins and veinlets occur throughout these bodies.  To the south of Radio Lake (see Figure 4) a differentiated and zoned ultramafic-mafic intrusion occurs, consisting of a coarse-grained clinopyroxenite core, surrounded by peridotite and, in turn, enclosed by medium to coarse-grained hornblende-clinopyroxene gabbro. 
   
 The youngest intrusive rocks of the Indata Property consist of medium to coarse-grained grey and reddish grey biotite quartz monzonite and granite.  Whereas all other intrusive rocks in the area have been emplaced only into volcanic strata, this unit also intrudes limestone of the Cache Creek Group. 
   
 A large part of the Indata Property is covered by glacial and fluvioglacial deposits.  Extensive areas of glacial derived clay in low-lying areas complicate geochemical soil results. 
   
  Structure and Metamorphism  
   
 The area covered by the Indata Property can be divided into two structural domains: (i) the area underlain by carbonate rocks which is characterized by concentric folds and the development of a penetrative fabric in finer grained clastic interbeds; and (ii) that area underlain by volcanic strata which has undergone brittle deformation only.  Contacts between carbonate and volcanic strata are obscured by young cover but are inferred to be northwesterly-striking faults.  Drilling and geological mapping in the central part of the Indata Property has indicated the presence of a number of westerly-striking faults which show normal displacements of up to a few tens of metres. 

21 

Carbonate rocks have generally been recrystallized with the common development of sparry calcite while fine grained clastic interbeds display a greenschist facies mineral assemblage.  The assemblage actinolite/tremolite-chlorite-epidote within the matrix of volcanic rocks also suggests the attainment of greenschist grade of regional metamorphism in these strata. 
   
  Mineralization  
   
 Exploration on the Indata Property has resulted in the discovery of a number of metallic mineral occurrences which can be divided into two main types: porphyry copper mineralization and quartz-carbonate polymetallic vein mineralization.  The location of these zones of mineralization is shown in Figure 5. 
   
 Figure 5: Exploration Summary Map 

22 

The currently known area of porphyry copper mineralization occurs on the east side of the north end of Albert Lake (Lake Zone).  Here a strong and consistent  250 ppm Cu in soil anomaly often coincides with chargeability anomalies from the induced polarization surveys.  This soil anomaly is approximately 2,000 metres north to south and averages 400 to 600 metres east to west and sometimes attains soil copper values in excess of 7,000 ppm.  Porphyry copper type mineralization is known at the north end of this feature in outcrops, trenches and drill core occurring as disseminated and fracture controlled pyrite-chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite in volcanic and granodiorite rock units.  The best drill results from this area have been 145.4 metres averaging 0.20% copper, including 24.1 metres of 0.37% Cu in drillhole 98-I-4.  Minor work has been conducted in the southern part of the soil anomaly/chargeability high where exploration work in 2012 and 2013 has discovered similar mineralized rubble 3,800 metres to the south indicating that the area of porphyry copper mineralization may extend across a considerable area. 
   
 Polymetallic veins have been recognized in the central part of the Indata Property to the east of the porphyry copper mineralization (see Figures 5 and 6) within andesitic volcanic rocks and serpentinized ultramafics.  The veins generally occupy a northerly-striking fault zone dipping shallowly to the east.  Within ultramafic rocks, the veins are accompanied by zones of intense carbonate and talc alteration zones which range in width from a few metres to over 50 metres in deeper and more easterly parts of the fault.  Proximal to the veins in volcanic rocks, especially adjacent to ultramafic contacts, alteration is dominated by silicification and the formation of quartz-carbonate veinlets but silicification is not common within ultramafic rocks. 
   
 To date, five separate mineralized polymetallic veins have been located on the Indata Property.  Four of these are in the central part of the Indata Property on top of the ridge between Indata and Albert Lakes, and all have general north-south orientations.  The longest of these has been traced in drilling for over 450 metres.  The fifth vein occurs to the northwest, halfway towards the Lake Zone porphyry copper mineralization, where a 10 centimetre vein was discovered in 2007.  This vein has an east-west orientation. 
   
 Polymetallic veins often exhibit a subtle banded appearance with bands of quartz dominant material interrupted with sulphide rich sections where the sulphide content can exceed 50%.  Sulphides are dominantly pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite and stibnite with lesser pyrite and minor chalcopyrite.  Veins average approximately 1.5 metres in width but vary between 0.5 and 5.6 metres.  Trace amounts of gersdorffite (a nickel arsenide), bismuthinite (a bismuth telluride), pentlandite (a nickel sulphide) and free gold have been documented in petrographic samples taken from high-grade intercepts.  A review of 24 diamond drill intercepts grading at least 1.0 g/t gold indicates that the average vein intercept is 1.54 metres wide with an average grade of 8.41 g/t gold and 52.43 g/t silver.  It must, however, be pointed out that one very high grade intercept in hole 88-11 biases this number such that if it is removed from the calculation then the remaining 23 drill intercepts have an average thickness of 1.43 metres with an average grade of 3.06 g/t gold and 59.40 g/t silver.  These drill intercepts are generally close to true thicknesses (g/t have been converted from ppb). 
   
 Antimony, arsenic and gold are the best soil geochemical pathfinders for the polymetallic veins.  The high sulfide content of the veins also makes them a good target for closely spaced induced polarization surveys. 
   
 The relationship between the porphyry copper mineralization and the polymetallic veins has yet to be established although it is possible that the polymetallic vein mineralization represents an outer zone to a central, copper-dominated part of the same hydrothermal system.  The host volcanic rocks of the porphyry copper mineralization exhibit a mineral assemblage consistent with both propylitic hydrothermal alteration and greenschist faces regional metamorphism and could be a result of either one of, or both processes.  Because of poor outcrop and the paucity of drilling within the copper zone and in areas away from the polymetallic veins, a regional hydrothermal zonation has not been adequately interpreted within the Indata Property.  Alternatively the veins and porphyry copper style mineralization may be unrelated and are present together as coincidence, centered on the strong structural provenance of the Pinchi Fault Zone. 

23 

Deposit Type  
   
 The Indata Property is host to mineralization of two deposit types: polymetallic precious metal veins and porphyry copper.  Porphyry copper mineralization is known on the Indata Property from the Lake Zone on the east side of Albert Lake, some 500 metres west of the area of the polymetallic veins.  Drill results here include 145.4 metres averaging 0.20% Cu, which includes a higher grade interval of 24.1 metres of 0.37% Cu.  There are a number of other porphyry copper occurrences in the area.  The Central Zone of Serengeti Resources  Kwanika Project, located 14 kilometres north of the Indata Property, contains an indicated resource of 244 million tonnes averaging 0.23% Cu, 0.21 g/t Au and 0.69 g/t Ag. ( Roscoe Postle and Associates NI 43-101 Technical Report for Kwanika Property Preliminary Economic Assessment, 2013, Report filed on SEDAR March 4, 2013 ). 
   
  Homestake  style gold mineralization, similar to the Indata Property vein occurrences, occurs at the Snowbird deposit located near Fort St. James to the south of the Indata region, and at Mt. Sir Sidney Williams to the north of the Indata Property.  Arsenopyrite-stibnite-chalcopyrite-pyrite veins with enriched precious metals occur at these occurrences at or near the contact of mafic and ultramafic rocks.  Drill results from polymetallic veins on the Indata Property have reached as high as 4.0 metres of 46.20g/t Au and 2.0g/t Ag in hole 88-I-11, and 3.2 metres of 0.01 g/t Au and 354.1 g/t Ag in hole 89-I-6. 
   
 Other mineralization styles are known from elsewhere in the region.  Epithermal mercury mineralization in carbonate rocks occurs at the former producing Bralorne-Takla Mercury Mine, located 26 kilometres north of the Indata Property, and Pinchi Mine, located 100 kilometres to the southeast.  The Lustdust skarn deposit is located 1.5 kilometres west of the Bralorne-Takla Mine, and has returned drill results including 0.80% copper and 0.67g/t gold over 59 metres and 2.19% copper and 24.04 g/t gold over 15 metres. 
   
  Plan of Operations  
   
 The Company plans to explore the under-explored southern part of the Indata Property (Area B of Figure 6), where recent exploration has discovered indications of porphyry mineralization.  These indicators include coincidental copper in soil-chargeability anomalies, float rock samples with up to 0.78% Cu, and the existence of intrusive rocks in outcrop. 
   
 A two-phase program is proposed: an initial phase of surface work followed up by a second phase of diamond drilling.  The first phase, budgeted at $304,605, entails installing grids and mapping, and following up with an IP-magnetics survey and soil sampling over the gridded area.  Prospecting and rock sampling of the area will also take place in conjunction with this program. 
   
 Should appropriate targets be discovered during the surface program, it should be followed up by diamond drilling of the best targets.  A 2,000 metre program costing $283,500 is proposed for this, bringing the total budget to $588,105.

Klondike Properties  
   
 The Klondike Properties consist of a portfolio of seven gold and base metal exploration properties, namely Clubine, Cruz-Midway, Panda Irishman, Quartz Mountain, Red Point, Ron Gold and Thea.  These properties are comprised of 150 claims covering 128 square kilometers, are located in southeast British Columbia and are easily accessible by forest service roads.  The properties are briefly described below. 
   
 Figure 7: Map of the Klondike Properties 

Clubine  
 Clubine is a former gold and silver producer. The mineralization consists of gold-silver-zinc base metal veins.  The mine was operated intermittently between 1926 and 1942; production came from six underground levels.  Clubine produced 3900 oz. Au, 7700 oz Ag, and 818 kg of Zn from 3,666 tonnes of ore.  Gold occurs in quartz veins and also within silicified and pyritic zones.  Reported UG sampling in 1934 were: 

34.6 g/tonne Au over 21.6 meters (strike length) in Level No. 2; and 
   
 21.6 g/tonne Au over 8.6 meters (strike length) in Level No. 5. 
   
 The two gold-silver (+zinc) bearing quartz veins that are known to occur would be the subject of future exploration in Clubine.  Clubine offers the most advanced drilling targets of the Klondike Properties and drilling can be initiated as soon as permits are in place.

Figure 8: Clubine Historical Drill Hole Locations 

Red Point Property  
 This project is located 6 km east of the Rossland mining camp.  Several Rossland-style massive pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite -gold veins have been found in the property.  The main Rossland gold-copper veins collectively produced a total of 2.37M oz of gold at an average grade of 15.6g/t and 1.01% Cu. The main vein system trends NE and is postulated to continue toward Red Point.  Previous exploration was focused on the Red Point area (same name as the property) targeting Rossland-style mineralization which has so far not been successful.  This makes the other zones namely a) NE extension of the Gold Dust Trend, b) Orient, and c) Cathedral occurrences, attractive subjects of the next exploration phase.  Mineralization at the Red Point property is bulk tonnage gold characterized by disseminated mineralization occurring largely in fragmental volcanic rocks with higher concentrations in fractures and veins that occur along the NE-trending structures.  Past work on the property consisted of airborne geophysical surveying, geological mapping, soil geochemical grid work and diamond drilling.

Ron   
 This property consists of claims within or around the former Anglo-Swiss property that contains the historic Kenville Gold Mine which produced close to 100,000 oz of gold.  A NI 43-101 compliant technical report outlined an inferred resource of 357,000 oz at a 23 g/t gold grade.  The gold-rich veins in the Kenville Mine extend south to the Ron Property ground.

Quartz Mountain  
 The Quartz Mountain property is located in an area associated with historic placer gold production (Perry Creek and its tributaries) and thus has been actively prospected for bedrock sources of gold for many years.  The property includes two small pits, Price Pit and Golden Egg, each of which has seen small production: 3,173 grams of gold and 5,194 grams of silver from Price Pit in the 1930s and 14,900 grams of gold and 13,400 grams of silver from Golden Egg in 1973/74.  Gold occurs within quartz veins which typically also carry minor base metals and iron sulfides. 
 In addition to gold mineralization, the most recent study suggests that the mineralization and alteration features appear indicative of an IOCG environment.

Thea   
 On the Thea property, gold is present from several shear zones that returned assays of up to 4.2 g/t gold.  While Thea had been explored previously for a Sullivan style deposit, the Company s focus will be on gold due to the discovery of  nine shear zones characterized by intense brecciation/silicification with multi-gram gold.  The largest zone found is: 
    
 Traceable over 200 m 
    
 1 to 2 m wide 
    
 Highest sample of 4.2 g/t Au 
  Panda Irishman and Cruz-Midway  
 These properties offer the Company an opportunity to get involved in a zinc play.  They are located in a district recognized for the presence of economic zinc deposits; the Sullivan mine of Teck Resources.  A recent option agreement between Teck and PJX on the DD property adjoining Panda Irishman indicates some degree of interest in the district and any positive result on the DD property could extend to Panda Irishman.  Noteworthy exploration results on these properties are: 
 Panda Irishman: 
    
 Sullivan horizon in 5 drill holes ( 150m thick) 
    
 8% Pb and 9.7% Zn over 2.6m

Intellectual Property  
   
 The Company claims common law trademark rights in its corporate name and logo. It does not hold any registered copyright, trademark, patent or other intellectual property right. 
   
  Employees  
   
 The Company currently has one full-time employee, its Chief Executive Officer.  Its other officers and directors provide services to the Company on an as-needed basis, and the Company plans to rely on their efforts, as well as those of a number of independent consultants, to manage its operations for the foreseeable future. 
   
  Government Regulations  
   
 The Company plans to engage in mineral exploration and development activities and will accordingly be exposed to environmental risks associated with mineral exploration activity. Pursuant to the Option Agreement, it is now the operator of the Indata Property. 
   
 The Company s exploration and development activities will be subject to extensive federal, provincial and local laws, regulations and permits governing protection of the environment. Among other things, its operations must comply with authorizations issued under the  Mines Act  (British Columbia) and the  Environmental Management Act  (British Columbia). 
   
 The Company s plan is to conduct its operations in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. It believes that its operations comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in all material respects. As of the date of this Report, the only environmental permit or authorization it requires to conduct its proposed work program is the  Notice of Work  filed with the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines; however, the Company expects that regular monitoring and compliance with periodic reporting requirements will be integral components of any such permits or authorizations that it applies for or receives in the future. 
   
 The costs associated with implementing and complying with environmental requirements can be substantial and possible future legislation and regulations could cause the Company to incur additional operating expenses, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in developing or conducting operations on its properties, including the Indata Property, the extent of which cannot be predicted with any certainty. 
   
 To the best of the Company s knowledge, there are no existing environmental liabilities on either the Indata Property or the Klondike Properties.

  Item 2.   
  Properties   
   
  On May 25, 2015, the Company paid Eastfield $20,000 in cash and provided Eastfield with a copy of completed technical report on the Indata Property in compliance with National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators, thereby completing the first milestone under the Option Agreement required to earn an undivided 60% interest in and to the Indata Property.  

32 

On July 13, 2016, the Company paid Klondike $50,000 in cash, issued 1,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock, and issued 1,500,000 warrants exercisable at a price of $0.227 per share until July 13, 2018, thereby completing the First Closing under the Purchase Agreement to acquire the Klondike Properties.  
   
  In addition, the Company currently rents office space leased by another company totaling approximately 3,000 square feet in area for which it pays approximately 8% of the total monthly costs. This space is located at Suite 488, 1090 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 3V7, and the Company believes that it is generally suitable to meet its needs for the foreseeable future; however, it will continue to seek additional space as required to satisfy its growth.  
   
      Item 3.   
  Legal Proceedings   
   
     On September 17, 2014, the Company learned that it was the subject, along with a number of additional defendants, of a notice of civil claim (the  Claim ) filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by Wundr Software Inc. ( Wundr ), an eBook software developer. Wundr and the Company were formerly parties to a binding letter of intent that was announced on November 12, 2013 (the  Wundr LOI ), pursuant to which the Company proposed to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Wundr. On January 10, 2014, the Company reported that the Wundr LOI had expired. 
   
 Among other things, the Claim alleges that the Company committed the tort of intentional interference with economic or contractual relations by virtue of its role in an alleged scheme to establish a competing business to Wundr, and that the Company, through its agents, breached the terms of the Wundr LOI by appropriating certain confidential information and intellectual property of Wundr for the purpose of establishing a competing business.  The Claim also alleges that the Company is vicariously liable for the actions of its agents. 
   
 Wundr is seeking general damages from the Company as well as damages for conspiracy to cause economic harm.  None of the allegations contained in the Claim have been proven in court, the Company believes that they are without merit, and it therefore intends to vigorously defend its position against Wundr.  
   
 Other than as described above, the Company is not aware of any material pending legal proceedings to which it is a party or of which the Property is the subject. The Company also knows of no proceedings to which any of its directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial holders of more than 5% of any class of the Company s securities, or any associate of any such director, officer, affiliate or security holder are an adverse party or have a material interest adverse to the Company.

Market Information   
   
  The Company s common stock is quoted under the symbol  RYES  on the OTC Pink Current Information tier of the over-the-counter market operated by OTC Markets Inc.   The Company s common stock is not traded on any exchange and it cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for its common stock. 
   
 OTC Pink securities are not listed and traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Pink securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers. OTC Pink issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a national or regional stock exchange 
   
 The following table reflects the high and low bid information for the Company s common stock based on inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission, and may not represent actual transactions.  It also reflects the 1 for 80 reverse split that the Company completed on January 22, 2015. 

The market for the Company s common stock has been sporadic and there have been long periods during which there were few, if any, trades.  Accordingly, reliance should not be placed on the quotations listed above, as the trades and depth of the market may be limited, and therefore, such quotes may not be a true indication of the current market value of the Company s common stock.  
   
  The Company s common stock is also listed on the CSE under the symbol  UPP , and the  following table reflects the high and low bid information for the common stock on that market since it began trading on February 1, 2016:

Holders  
   
 As of the date of this Report, there are approximately 52 holders of record of the Company s common stock. 
   
  Dividends  
   
 The Company has not paid dividends since its inception. While there are no restrictions in the Company s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or pursuant to any agreement or understanding which could prevent the Company from paying dividends or distributions, the Company has limited cash flow and anticipates using all available cash resources to fund working capital and explore the Indata Property. As such, there are no plans to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decisions to pay dividends in cash or otherwise in the future will be made by the Board of Directors on the basis of the Company s earnings, financial requirements and other conditions existing at the time a determination is made. 
   
  Penny Stock  
   
 The Company s common stock is subject to the provisions of Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15g-9 thereunder, commonly referred to as the  penny stock rule . Section 15(g) sets forth certain requirements for transactions in penny stock, and Rule 15g-9(d) incorporates the definition of  penny stock  that is found in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. The SEC generally defines a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The Company is subject to the SEC s penny stock rules. 
   
 Since the Company s common stock is deemed to be penny stock, trading in its shares is subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stock to persons other than established customers and accredited investors.  Accredited investors  are generally persons with assets in excess of US$1,000,000 or annual income exceeding US$200,000 or US$300,000 together with their spouse. For transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of securities and must have the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the first transaction, of a risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for penny stocks held in an account and information to the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, these rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealer to trade and/or maintain a market in the Company s common stock and may affect the ability of stockholders to sell their shares. 
   
  Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans  
   
 On March 23, 2016, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of an incentive stock option plan that provides for the granting of options representing up to 10% of the Company s common stock to its directors, officers, employees and consultants.  As the date of this Report, the Company has granted options to purchase 3,286,600 shares at prices of between $0.15 and $0.20 per share to six individuals under the plan. 
   
 The Company does not have any other compensation plans under which its equity securities are authorized for issuance. 
   
   Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities   
   
 Other than as disclosed in previous quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K, the Company has not issued any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act within the past three years. 

35 

Description of Registrant s Securities to be Registered   
   
 The Company s authorized capital consists of 400,000,000 shares of common stock, US$0.001 par value. 
   
  Common Stock  
   
 As of the date of this Report, the Company has 33,266,261 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
   
 Holders of the Company s common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase additional shares of common stock or other subscription rights. The common stock carries no conversion rights and is not subject to redemption or to any sinking fund provisions. All shares of the Company s common stock are entitled to share equally in dividends from sources legally available, when, as and if declared by its Board of Directors, and upon the Company s liquidation or dissolution, whether voluntary or involuntary, to share equally in its assets available for distribution to security holders. 
   
 The Board of Directors is authorized to issue additional shares of common stock not to exceed the amount authorized by the Company s Articles of Incorporation, on such terms and conditions and for such consideration as the Board may deem appropriate without further security holder action. 
   
    Voting Rights  
   
 Each holder of the Company s common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters on which such stockholders are entitled to vote. Since the shares of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, the holders of more than 50% of the shares voting for the election of directors can elect all the directors if they choose to do so and, in such event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any person to the Board of Directors. 
   
  Dividend Policy  
   
 Holders of the Company s common stock are entitled to dividends if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. Since the Company s inception on February 9, 2007 it has not declared any dividends. 
   
 The Company does not intend to issue any cash dividends in the future. It intends to retain earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of its business. However, it is possible that management may decide to declare a stock dividend in the future. Any future dividend policy will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be contingent upon future earnings, if any, the Company s financial condition, its capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors.

Item 7.    
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
   
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth in the Company s audited financial statements for the period ended July 31, 2016.  

36 

Plan of Operations  
   
 As at July 31, 2016, the Company had a cash balance of $139,021, compared to a cash balance of $18,000 as of July 31, 2015. 
   
 The Company s plan of operations for the next 12 months is to carry out the first of a two-phase exploration program on the Indata Property at a total cost of approximately $304,605, as follows: 
   
  Phase I: Line Cutting, Mapping, Geophysical and Geochemical Surveys  

The first phase combines line cutting, soil sampling and geophysics work to provide the information needed to determine drill targets, if any, for the second phase and will achieve the exploration budget for the next 12 months required by the Option Agreement.  The Company expects to complete the second phase of the exploration program by November 30, 2017, as follows: 
   
  Phase II: Drilling Program  

37 

The Company is currently evaluating the seven southeast British Columbia properties that we purchased from Klondike.  An exploration program will be compiled based on the findings from this evaluation.  The Company is also undertaking a due diligence process on the US Property that it has under option, and evaluating whether to proceed with the purchase of that property. 
   
 In addition to the two phase program and future work on the southeast British Columbia properties, the Company anticipates spending approximately $291,500 on general operating expenses, including fees payable in connection with its filing obligations as a reporting issuer in both the United States and Canada, as follows: 

The Company does not currently have sufficient funds to carry out the two-phase exploration program or cover our anticipated general operating expenses for the year, so it will require additional funding. The Company anticipates that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of its common stock or from loans from one of several directors or officers, or companies controlled by directors or officers.  The Company does not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing or loans, and if the Company is not successful in raising additional financing, the Company anticipates that it will not be able to proceed with its business plan. 
   
 The Company anticipates incurring operating losses for the foreseeable future. It bases this expectation, in part, on the fact that very few mineral claims in the exploration stage ultimately develop into producing, profitable mines. The Company s future financial results are also uncertain due to a number of factors, some of which are outside its control. These factors include the following: 

its ability to raise additional funding; 
   
 the market price for any minerals that may be discovered on the Indata Property; 
   
 the results of its proposed exploration program on the Indata Property. 

38 

The Company has not attained profitable operations and is dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue its proposed exploration activities. For these reasons the Company s auditors believe that there is substantial doubt that it will be able to continue as a going concern. 
   
      Results of Operations   
   
  For the Years Ended July 31, 2016 and 2015  
   
 The Company s operating results for the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows: 

The Company s operating expenses increased during the year ended July 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of increased activity preparing for and completing its listing on the CSE, acquiring the Klondike Properties and researching and compiling exploration plans for the Indata property and the Klondike Properties.  Increases in costs for consulting, Filing and regulatory, Professional fees and Promotion and shareholder communications were all driven by the new listing and increases in Consulting and Mineral exploration expenses related to planning and researching the Company s mineral properties.   
   
 The largest difference between the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015 was $369,006 for share based payments through the grant of options pursuant to the Company s recently adopted option plan to incentivize management and certain consultants.  Other notable items were gains to the Company for the write-off of certain amounts payable on the settlement of certain older debts in the year ended July 31, 2016, and a large gain on foreign exchange due to the movement in the Canadian dollar / US dollar exchange rate and realized foreign exchange on Canadian-denominated debt settled through the issuance of common stock in the year ended July 31, 2015 that was not repeated in 2016.  The Company s other operating expenses were generally consistent from period-to period. 
   
      Liquidity and Capital Resources  
       
 As of July 31, 2016, the Company had $139,021 in cash, $168,608 in current assets, $731,639 in total assets, $227,210 in current and total liabilities, a working capital deficit of $58,602 and an accumulated deficit of $1,836,969. 
   
 During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company used $276,299 in net cash on operating activities, whereas it used $9,705 in net cash on operating activities during the prior year.  The difference in net cash used in operating  

39 

activities during the two years was largely due to the increase in the Company s net loss for the most recent year, as adjusted for the accrual of a smaller accounts payable, accrued liabilities and due to related parties balance. 
   
 During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company used net cash of $80,000 on investing activities, whereas it used net cash of $26,748 on investing activities during the prior year.  In the current year, the Company paid $80,000 in acquisition costs on mineral properties (2015 - $20,000). 
   
 The Company received net cash of $477,320 from financing activities during the year ended July 31, 2016, whereas it received $171,876 in net cash from financing activities during the prior year.  Other than $46,500 (2015 - $Nil) in loan payments made during the year, all of the net cash the Company received from financing activities during the current year was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of its common stock. 
   
 The Company expects to operate at a loss for at least the next 12 months. It has no agreements for additional financing and cannot provide any assurance that additional funding will be available to finance its operations on acceptable terms in order to enable it to carry out its business plan. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to complete further sales of its common stock or any other form of additional financing. If the Company is unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue its plan of operations, then it will not be able to carry out any exploration work on the Indata Property or the other properties in which it owns an interest and its business may fail. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 FOR THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2016 

1.  
  NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS  
   
 Atlantic Resources Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 9, 2007 and is in the exploration stage. On January 14, 2015, the Company merged its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rise Resources Inc., a Nevada corporation, in and to the Company to effect a name change from Patriot Minefinders Inc. to Rise Resources Inc.  Rise Resources Inc. was formed solely for the purpose of effecting the change of name.   
   
 On February 16, 2015, the Company increased its authorized capital from 21,000,000 shares to 400,000,000 shares.   
   
 On January 29, 2016, the Company completed an initial public offering in Canada and began trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange ( CSE ) on February 1, 2016. 
   
 The Company is in the early stages of exploration and as is common with any exploration company, it raises financing for its acquisition activities.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which presumes that the Company will continue operations for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company has incurred a loss of $633,466 for the year ended July 31, 2016 and has accumulated a deficit of $1,836,969.  This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan, which is typical for a start-up company.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
 Management of the Company ( management ) is of the opinion that sufficient financing will be required from external financing and further share issuances to meet the Company s obligations.  At July 31, 2016, the Company had working capital deficiency of $58,602.  
   
  2.  
  BASIS OF PREPARATION  
   
  Generally accepted accounting principles  
   
 These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America ( US GAAP ) for financial information with the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-K.  Results are not necessarily indicative of results which may be achieved in the future. 
   
  Change in Functional and Presentation Currency  
   
 The Company s expenses and overheads are now primarily being incurred in Canadian Dollars ( CAD ) and it is anticipated that cash flows will continue to be primarily in CAD. Accordingly, the Company determined that effective August 1, 2015, the functional currency of the Company would change from the United States Dollar ( USD ) to CAD.  
   
 Effective August 1, 2015, the Company also changed its presentation currency from USD to CAD. As a result of changing the presentation currency, all the comparative assets and liabilities were translated using the closing rate at the balance sheet date, comparative equity were translated at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction and the statements of loss were translated at the average exchange rate for the period covered. All resulting change differences are recognized in the accumulated deficit in the balance sheets  shareholders  equity (deficiency) section. A change in presentation currency is accounted for as a change in accounting policy and is applied retrospectively, as if the new presentation currency had always been the presentation currency. Consequently, the comparatives for the year ended July 31, 2015 and as at July 31, 2015 have been restated to be presented in CAD. The exchange rates applied for translation purposes were as follows:

Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Significant areas requiring the use of estimates include the carrying value and recoverability of mineral properties and the recognition of deferred tax assets based on the change in unrecognized deductible temporary tax differences.  Actual results could differ from those estimates, and would impact future results of operations and cash flows. 
   
  Restatement  
   
 Certain prior year balances within equity have been restated to comply with the Company s accounting policies.

 The costs of acquiring mineral rights are capitalized at the date of acquisition.  After acquisition, various factors can affect the recoverability of the capitalized costs.  If, after review, management concludes that the carrying amount of a mineral property is impaired, it will be written down to estimated fair value.  Exploration costs incurred on mineral properties are expensed as incurred.  Development costs incurred on proven and probable reserves will be capitalized.  Upon commencement of production, capitalized costs will be amortized using the unit-of-production method over the estimated life of the ore body based on proven and probable reserves (which exclude non-recoverable reserves and anticipated processing losses).  When the Company receives an option payment related to a property, the proceeds of the payment are applied to reduce the carrying value of the exploration asset. 
   
  Long-lived assets   
   
 Long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets, the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted net cash flows related to the long-lived assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (cont d ) 
   
  Asset retirement obligations   
   
 The Company records the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development, and/or normal use of the long-lived assets. The Company also records a corresponding asset which is amortized over the life of the asset. Subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation, the obligation is adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time (accretion expense) and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation (asset retirement cost).  
   
  Loss per share  
   
 Basic loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.  To calculate diluted loss per share, the Company uses the treasury stock method and the  if converted  method.   
   
  Financial instruments  
   
 The Company s financial instruments consist of cash, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and due to related parties. It is management s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from its financial instruments.  The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values unless otherwise noted.   
   
  Fair value of financial assets and liabilities  
   
 The Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on US GAAP guidance which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. 
   
 The Company classifies financial assets and liabilities as held-for-trading, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, loans and receivables or other financial liabilities depending on their nature.  Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized at fair value on their initial recognition, except for those arising from certain related party transactions which are accounted for at the transferor s carrying amount or exchange amount. 
   
 Financial assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading are measured at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in net income.  Financial assets classified as held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, and financial liabilities other than those classified as held-for-trading are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method of amortization.  Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses being recognized as other comprehensive income until realized, or if an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary, the unrealized loss is recorded in income. 
   
 The following indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilizes to determine the fair value of financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

 Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; 
 Level 2   Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly; and 
 Level 3   Inputs that are not based on observable market data. 
   
 Financial instruments, including loan from related parties, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities and are carried at cost, which management believes approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments.   
   
  Concentration of credit risk  
   
 The financial instrument which potentially subjects the Company to concentration of credit risk is cash. The Company maintains cash in bank accounts that, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. As of July 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not exceeded the federally insured limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash in bank accounts.  
   
  Stock-based compensation  
   
 The Company accounts for share-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation .  Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, or liabilities incurred, whichever is more reliably measured.  Grant date for all stock-based awards to employees and directors and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.  The Black-Scholes option valuation model is used to calculate fair value. 
   
 The Company accounts for stock compensation arrangements with non-employees in accordance with ASC 718 which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. For stock options granted to employees, directors, and non-employees, the fair value of the stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. 
   
  Income taxes  
   
 The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Under the asset and liability method the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized. 
   
  Foreign exchange  
   
 The Company s functional currency is the Canadian dollar. Any monetary assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the Canadian dollar are translated at the rate prevailing at year end. Revenue and expenses in a foreign currency are translated at rates that approximate those in effect at the time of translation. Gains and losses from translation of foreign currency transactions into Canadian dollars are included in current results of operations.

  Recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards  (cont d ) 
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern .  This ASU provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if  conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard. 
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .  This ASU eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet and replaces it with a noncurrent classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities.  The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard.  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities .  This ASU amendment addresses aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  It affects investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value, and simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without a readily determinable fair value by requiring a qualitative assessment.  The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard.  
 Other than the above, the Company has determined that other significant newly issued accounting pronouncements and are either not applicable to the Company s business or that no material effect is expected on the financial statements as a result of future adoption.

  Item 9A.   
  Controls and Procedures   
   
      Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) defines the term  disclosure controls and procedures  to mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to its principal executive and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  
   
 As of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on this evaluation, the Company concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of July 31, 2016 because the following material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date: 
   
 (i) 
 lack of segregation of incompatible duties due to insufficient personnel.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance  
   
 Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires a company s directors and officers, and persons who own more than 10% of any class of a company s equity securities which are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, to file with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership of our common shares and other equity securities, on Forms 3, 4 and 5, respectively.  Such officers, directors and 10% stockholders are also required to furnish the company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.  Based solely on the Company s review of the copies of such forms received by it, or written representations from the reporting persons as of the date of this Report, it believes that all Section 16(a) reports applicable to its directors, officers and 10% stockholders with respect to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 have been filed. 
   
  Audit Committee Financial Expert  
   
 Fred Tejada is an  audit committee financial expert  within the meaning of Item 401(h)(1) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.

  Compensation Committee   
   
 At present, the Board of Directors as a whole determines the compensation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and does so with reference to industry standards and the financial situation of the Company. The Board of Directors has the sole responsibility for determining the compensation of the directors of the Company. As of the date of this Report, directors are not compensated for their services, although certain of them were granted options to purchase shares of the company s common stock on March 23, 2016 pursuant to the Company s incentive stock option plan. 
 Given the Company s size, limited operating history and lack of revenues, the Board of Directors does not plan to form a compensation committee to monitor and review the salary and benefits of the executive officers of the Company at the present time.

  Code of Ethics

Item 13.   
  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.  
   
   Transactions with Related Persons   
   
 The following includes a summary of transactions since August 1, 2015, or any currently proposed transaction, in which the Company was or is to be a participant and the amount involved exceeded or exceeds US$120,000 and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than compensation described in Item 11   Executive Compensation).  The Company believes the terms obtained or consideration that it paid or received, as applicable, in connection with the transactions described below were comparable to terms available or the amounts that would be paid or received, as applicable, in arm s-length transactions. 

During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company paid salaries of $5,000 (2015 - $Nil) to its Chief Executive Officer. 

During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company paid consulting fees of $30,000 (2015 - $19,203) to its former Chief Executive Officer, and $18,000 (2015 - $Nil) to its Chief Financial Officer. 

As at July 31, 2016, the Company had recorded loans from related parties of $43,214 or US$33,099 (2015 - $87,105 or US$67,100) representing advances made by two former directors and officers.  The advances are due on demand without interest. 

As at July 31, 2016, $25,494 (2015 - $11,313) in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is due to current and former officers and companies controlled by directors and officers of the Company.  Of this amount, $Nil (2015 - $604) represents advances made by Skanderbeg Capital Partners Inc., a company that advised the Company s management and performed promotional work for the Company ( Skanderbeg ).  Skanderbeg made payments on behalf of the Company until such time as it was able to complete a financing. 

Included in general and administration expenses for the year ended July 31, 2016 is rent of $7,128 (2015 - $5,042) paid to Skanderbeg. 
   
  Director Independence  
   
 Because the Company s common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, it currently uses the definition in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) for determining director independence, which provides that an  independent director  is a person other than an executive officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company s Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.  The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if: 

the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the company; 

the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of US$120,000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service); 

a family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the company; 

49 

the director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient s consolidated gross revenue for that year or US$200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions); 

the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or 

the director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the company s outside auditor, or at any time during the past three years was a partner or employee of the company s outside auditor, and who worked on the company s audit. 
   
 The Company has determined that only John Anderson meets this definition of independence.
