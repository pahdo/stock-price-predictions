Quidel Corporation 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Quidel Corporation and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation (consisting of normal recurring accruals) have been included. 
  The information at   September 30, 2016  , and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , is unaudited. For further information, refer to the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating results for any quarter are historically seasonal in nature and are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. 
  For   2016   and   2015  , the Company s fiscal year will end or has ended on January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016, respectively. For   2016   and   2015  , the Company s   third   quarter ended on October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively. For ease of reference, the calendar quarter end dates are used herein. The   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 each included 13 and 39 weeks, respectively. 
  Comprehensive Loss 
  Comprehensive loss includes foreign currency translation adjustments excluded from the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, customer programs and incentives, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, software development costs, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation, contingent consideration, the fair value of the debt component of convertible debt instruments and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  The Company records revenues primarily from product sales. These revenues are recorded net of rebates and other discounts that are estimated at the time of sale, and are largely driven by various customer program offerings, including special pricing agreements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. Revenue from product sales are recorded upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer. Passage of title to the product and recognition of revenue occurs upon delivery to the customer when sales terms are free on board ( FOB ) destination and at the time of shipment when the sales terms are FOB shipping point and there is no right of return.  
  A portion of product sales includes revenues for diagnostic kits, which are utilized on leased instrument systems under the Company s  reagent rental  program. The reagent rental program provides customers the right to use the instruments at no separate cost to the customer in consideration for a multi-year agreement to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables ( reagents  or  diagnostic kits ). When an instrument is placed with a customer under a reagent rental agreement, the Company retains title to the equipment and it remains capitalized on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as property and equipment. The instrument is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the life of the instrument. Depreciation expense is recorded in cost of sales included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The reagent rental agreements represent one unit of accounting as the instrument and consumables (reagents) are interdependent in producing a diagnostic result and neither has a stand-alone value with respect to these agreements. No revenue is recognized at the time of instrument placement. All revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss for the diagnostic kits have passed to the customer.

Royalty income from the grant of license rights is recognized during the period in which the revenue is earned and the amount is determinable from the licensee. 
  The Company earns income from grants for research and commercialization activities. On November 6, 2012, the Company was awarded a milestone-based grant totaling up to   $8.3 million   from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop, manufacture and validate a quantitative, low-cost, nucleic acid assay for HIV drug treatment monitoring on the integrated Savanna MDx platform for use in limited resource settings. Upon execution of the grant agreement, the Company received   $2.6 million   to fund subsequent research and development activities and received milestone payments totaling   $2.5 million   in 2013. On September 10, 2014, the Company entered into an amended grant agreement with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for additional funding of up to   $12.6 million   in order to accelerate the development of the Savanna MDx platform in the developing world. Upon execution of the amended grant agreement, the Company received   $10.6 million   in cash. The Company received payments of   $2.4 million   in April 2015 and   $2.8 million   in July 2016 based on milestone achievements for both the original and the amended grant agreements. Under the original and amended grant agreements, the Company recognizes grant revenue on the basis of the lesser of the amount recognized on a proportional performance basis or the amount of cash payments that are non-refundable as of the end of each reporting period. The Company recognized grant revenue of   $3.8 million   and   $0.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and recognized   $6.5 million   and   $3.2 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Cash payments received are restricted as to use until expenditures contemplated in the grant are incurred or committed. As of   September 30, 2016  , all payment related milestones have been achieved and all of the grant revenue of   $20.9 million   has been recorded.  
  Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company uses the fair value hierarchy established in ASC Topic 820  , Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,   that requires the valuation of assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements using a three tiered approach and fair value measurement be classified and disclosed by the Company in one of the following three categories: 
  Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 
  Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; 
  Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e. supported by little or no market activity). 
  The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, including cash, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which amends the guidance in former   ASC 605, Revenue Recognition  . This guidance is intended to improve and converge with international standards relating to the financial reporting requirements for revenue from contracts with customers. The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current authoritative guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The original guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. However, in July 2015, the FASB deferred by one year the effective dates of the new revenue recognition standard for entities reporting under GAAP. As a result, the standard will be effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance and expects to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in ASU 2014-15 (Subtopic 205-40),   Presentation of Financial Statements - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  . The guidance requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued when applicable). Management will be required to make this evaluation for both annual and interim reporting periods and will make certain disclosures if it concludes that substantial doubt exists or when its plans alleviate substantial doubt about the entity s

ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The term probable is used consistently with its use in ASC Topic 450,   Contingencies  . The guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and for interim reporting periods starting in the first quarter 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements and expects to adopt the standard for the annual reporting period ended December 31, 2016. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued guidance codified in ASU 2015-02 (Topic 810),   Consolidation - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . The guidance affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the guidance amends (i) the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a decision maker or service provider), (ii) the variable interest entity (VIE) characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (iii) the primary beneficiary determination. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim reporting periods starting in the first quarter 2016. The Company's adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2016 did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance codified in ASU 2015-11 (Topic 330),   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  . The guidance applies to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost. Under the guidance, an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company's adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2016 did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance codified in ASU 2016-02 (Topic 842),   Leases  . The guidance requires a lessee to recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 including interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance and expects to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance codified in ASU 2016-09 (Topic 718),   Improvements to Employee Share Based Payments Accounting.   Under the guidance, entities will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in additional paid-in capital (APIC). Instead, they will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, and APIC pools will be eliminated. In addition, entities will recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. Under current guidance, excess tax benefits are not recognized until the deduction reduces taxes payable. Companies will apply this part of the guidance using a modified retrospective transition method and will record a cumulative-effect adjustment in retained earnings for excess tax benefits not previously recognized. The guidance also allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance and expects to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2017. 
   
  Note 2. Computation of Loss Per Share 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , basic loss per share was computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units (RSUs) vested during the period. Diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) reflects the potential dilution that could occur if the earnings were divided by the weighted-average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares from outstanding stock options as well as unvested RSUs. Potential dilutive common shares were calculated using the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable upon exercise of the Company s outstanding stock options and unvested RSUs.  
  As the effect would be anti-dilutive,   0.9 million   and   0.8 million   of outstanding stock options and RSUs were excluded from the computation of loss per share for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   0.9 million   and   1.0 million   of outstanding stock options and RSUs were excluded from the computation of loss per share for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Additionally, stock options are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS when the combined exercise price, unrecognized stock-based compensation and expected tax benefits upon exercise are greater than the average market price for the Company s common stock because their effect is anti-dilutive. Stock options totaling   1.9 million   and   2.9 million   for the  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   2.2 million   and   1.8 million   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the exercise of such options would be anti-dilutive. 
  As discussed in Note 6, the Company issued its 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 ( Convertible Senior Notes ) in December 2014. It is the Company s intent and policy to settle conversions through combination settlement, which essentially involves repayment of an amount of cash equal to the  principal portion  and delivery of the  share amount  in excess of the conversion value over the principal portion in cash or shares of common stock ( conversion premium ). No conversion premium existed as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ; therefore, there was no dilutive impact from the Convertible Senior Notes to diluted EPS during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
  Note 3. Inventories 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Inventories consisted of the following, net of reserves of   $0.6 million   and   $0.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively (in thousands): 

Note 4. Other Current Liabilities 
  Other current liabilities consist of the following (in thousands): 

Note 5. Income Taxes 
  The Company recognized an income tax benefit of   $0.3 million   and   $1.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, which represents an effective tax rate of   35%   and   59%  , respectively. The effective tax rate was higher for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   due to a year to date adjustment for the full year effective tax rate. The Company recognized an income tax benefit of   $7.1 million   and   $3.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, which represents an effective tax rate of   38%   and   36%  , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the effective tax rate benefit was higher as compared to the same period of 2015 due primarily to the federal research tax credit in 2016. There was no federal research tax credit for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as the credit provisions of the United States tax code had expired at the end of 2014 and were not reinstated until December 2015. 
  The Company is subject to periodic audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Due to the carryforward of unutilized net operating loss and credit carryovers, the Company's federal tax years from 2009 and forward are subject to examination by the U.S. authorities. The Company's state and foreign tax years for 2001 and forward are subject to examination by applicable tax authorities. The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter.  
   
  Note 6. Debt 
  3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 
  In December 2014, the Company issued   $172.5 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.25%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2020. Debt issuance costs of approximately   $5.1 million   were primarily comprised of underwriters fees, legal, accounting  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

and other professional fees of which   $4.2 million   were capitalized and are recorded as a reduction to long-term debt and are being amortized to interest expense over the   six  -year term of the Convertible Senior Notes. The remaining   $0.9 million   of debt issuance costs were allocated as a component of equity in additional paid-in capital. Deferred issuance costs related to the Convertible Senior Notes were   $2.9 million   and   $3.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  The Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock based on an initial conversion rate, subject to adjustment, of   31.1891   shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately   $32.06   per share) on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2020. The conversion will occur in the following circumstances and to the following extent: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2015, if the last reported sales price of the Company s common stock, for at least   20   trading days (whether or not consecutive) in the period of   30   consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the calendar quarter in which the conversion occurs, is more than   130%   of the conversion price of the notes in effect on each applicable trading day; (2) during the   five   consecutive business day period following any   five   consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Senior Note for each such trading day was less than   98%   of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the conversion rate on each such day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified events described in the indenture for the Convertible Senior Notes. On or after September 15, 2020 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date, holders may surrender their notes for conversion at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.  
  It is the Company s intent and policy to settle conversions through combination settlement, which essentially involves repayment of an amount of cash equal to the  principal portion  and delivery of the  share amount  in excess of the principal portion in shares of common stock or cash. In general, for each $1,000 in principal, the  principal portion  of cash upon settlement is defined as the lesser of $1,000, or the conversion value during the   25  -day observation period as described in the indenture for the Convertible Senior Notes. The conversion value is the sum of the daily conversion value which is the product of the effective conversion rate divided by   25   days and the daily volume weighted average price ( VWAP ) of the Company s common stock. The  share amount  is the cumulative  daily share amount  during the observation period, which is calculated by dividing the daily VWAP into the difference between the daily conversion value (i.e., conversion rate x daily VWAP) and $1,000. 
  The Company pays   3.25%   interest per annum on the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes semi-annually in arrears in cash on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Convertible Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2020. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded total interest expense of   $8.2 million   related to the Convertible Senior Notes of which   $4.1 million   related to the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs and   $4.1 million   related to the coupon due semi-annually. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded total interest expense of   $8.2 million   related to the Convertible Senior Notes of which   $4.0 million   related to the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs and   $4.2 million   related to the coupon due semi-annually.  
  If a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture for the Convertible Senior Notes, such as an acquisition, merger, or liquidation of the Company, occurs prior to the maturity date, subject to certain limitations, holders of the Convertible Senior Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Senior Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. 
  The Company accounts separately for the liability and equity components of the Convertible Senior Notes in accordance with authoritative guidance for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion. The guidance requires the carrying amount of the liability component to be estimated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated conversion feature. Because the Company had no outstanding non-convertible public debt, the Company determined that senior, unsecured corporate bonds traded on the market represent a similar liability to the Convertible Senior Notes without the conversion option. Based on market data available for publicly traded, senior, unsecured corporate bonds issued by companies in the same industry with similar credit ratings and with similar maturity, the Company estimated the implied interest rate of its Convertible Senior Notes to be   6.9%  , assuming no conversion option. Assumptions used in the estimate represent what market participants would use in pricing the liability component, which were defined as Level 2 observable inputs. The estimated implied interest rate was applied to the Convertible Senior Notes, which resulted in a     fair value of the liability component of   $141.9 million   upon issuance, calculated as the present value of implied future     payments based on the   $172.5 million   aggregate principal amount. The   $30.7 million   difference between the cash proceeds of   $172.5 million   and the estimated fair value of the liability component was recorded in additional paid-in capital, net of tax and issuance costs, as the Convertible Senior Notes were not considered redeemable.

     Table of Contents  

In the first quarter of 2016, the Company repurchased and retired   $5.2 million   in principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Senior Notes. The aggregate cash used for the transaction was   $4.5 million  . The repurchase resulted in a reduction in debt of   $4.4 million   and a reduction in additional paid-in capital of   $0.5 million   with a gain on extinguishment of Convertible Senior Notes of   $0.4 million   included in interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
  The following table summarizes information about the equity and liability components of the Convertible Senior Notes (dollars in thousands). The fair values of the respective notes outstanding were measured based on quoted market prices.   

  As a policy election under applicable guidance related to the calculation of diluted net EPS, the Company elected the combination settlement method as its stated settlement policy and applied the treasury stock method in the calculation of dilutive impact of the Convertible Senior Notes. The Convertible Senior Notes were not convertible as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ; therefore there was no dilutive impact during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . If the Convertible Senior Notes were converted as of   September 30, 2016  , the if-converted value would not exceed the principal amount. 
  Line of Credit 
  On August 10, 2012, the Company entered into an amended and restated   $140.0 million   senior secured syndicated credit facility (the  Senior Credit Facility ) that matures on   August 10, 2017  . As part of this amendment, the Company incurred an additional   $1.0 million   in deferred financing costs related to the Senior Credit Facility. Deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the Senior Credit Facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had deferred financing costs related to the Senior Credit Facility of   $0.3 million   included as a portion of prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had deferred financing costs related to the Senior Credit Facility of   $0.2 million   included as a portion of other non-current assets and   $0.3 million   included as a portion of prepaid expenses and other current assets. The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at either the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) or the base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The base rate is equal to the highest of (i) the lender s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus one-half of one percent and (iii) LIBOR plus   one   percent. The applicable margin is generally determined in accordance with a performance pricing grid based on the Company s leverage ratio and ranges from   1.25%   to   2.50%   for LIBOR rate loans and from   0.25%   to   1.50%   for base rate loans. The agreement governing the Senior Credit Facility includes certain customary covenants, including among others, limitations on: liens; mergers, consolidations and dispositions of assets; debt; dividends, stock redemptions and the redemption and/or prepayment of other debt; investments (including loans and advances) and acquisitions; and transactions with affiliates. The Company is also subject to financial covenants, which include (i) a funded debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility, with adjusted EBITDA generally calculated as earnings before, among other adjustments, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation) not to exceed   3  :1 as of the end of each fiscal quarter, and (ii) an interest coverage ratio of not less than   3  :1 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Funded debt is defined as outstanding borrowings on the Senior Credit Facility plus Convertible Senior Notes, less the Company s domestic cash and cash equivalents in excess of   $15.0 million  . The Senior Credit Facility is secured by substantially all present and future assets and properties of the Company and is senior to the Convertible Senior Notes. 
  The Company s ability to borrow under the Senior Credit Facility fluctuates from time to time due to, among other factors, the Company s borrowings under the facility, its funded debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio and interest coverage ratio. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   borrowings outstanding. Due to the limitations of the interest coverage ratio, the Company had   no   borrowing capacity under the Senior Credit Facility at   September 30, 2016  .

  Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Legal 
  The Company is involved in various claims and litigation matters from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that all such current legal actions, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company also maintains insurance, including coverage for product liability claims, in amounts which management believes are appropriate given the nature of its business.   No   accrual has been recorded as of   September 30, 2016   related to such matters as they are not probable and/or reasonably estimable. At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $0.2 million   accrued as a liability for various legal matters where the Company deemed the liability probable and estimable.  
  Licensing Arrangements 
  The Company has entered into various licensing and royalty agreements, which largely require payments by the Company based on specified product sales as well as the achievement of specified milestones. The Company had royalty and license expenses relating to those agreements of approximately   $0.1 million   for each of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company had royalty and license expenses relating to those agreements of approximately   $0.6 million   and   $0.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Research and Development Agreements 
  The Company has entered into various research and development agreements that provide it with rights to develop, manufacture and market products using the intellectual property and technology of its collaborative partners. Under the terms of certain of these agreements, the Company is required to make periodic payments based on achievement of certain milestones or resource expenditures. These milestones generally include achievement of prototype assays, validation lots and clinical trials. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , total future commitments under the terms of these agreements are     estimated at   $2.8 million   and   $4.2 million  , respectively. The commitments will fluctuate as the Company agrees to new phases of development under the existing arrangements. 
  Contingent Consideration 
  In conjunction with the acquisition of BioHelix Corporation ( BioHelix ) in May 2013, the Company agreed to contingent consideration ranging from   $5.0 million   to   $10.0 million   upon achievement of certain revenue targets through May 2018. The fair value of the revenue royalty earn-out to be settled in cash is estimated using a discounted revenue model. Due to changes in the estimated payments and a shorter discounting period, the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities

     Table of Contents  

changed, resulting in a gain of   $0.6 million   recorded to cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . There were   no   changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   No   payments related to the revenue royalty earn-out were disbursed during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Payments of   $0.2 million   and   $0.1 million   related to the revenue royalty earn-out were disbursed during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , the current portion of the contingent consideration is   $0.6 million   and the non-current portion of the contingent consideration is   $4.1 million  .  
  In August 2013, the Company acquired the assets of AnDiaTec GmbH   Co. KG ( AnDiaTec ), a privately-held, diagnostics company, based in Germany. The Company agreed to contingent consideration of up to    0.5 million   (  $0.6 million   based on the   September 30, 2016   currency conversion rate) upon achievement of certain revenue targets through 2018. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has included   $0.1 million   in the non-current portion of contingent consideration related to these revenue targets. In addition, the Company agreed to pay the founder of AnDiaTec contingent payments of up to    3.0 million   (  $3.4 million   based on the   September 30, 2016   currency conversion rate) upon achievement of certain research and development milestones, subject to continued employment. The Company paid   $0.3 million   for the achievement of agreed upon research and development milestones during the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and   none   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The Company paid   $0.9 million   and   $1.2 million   for the achievement of agreed upon research and development milestones during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These costs are recorded as compensation expense included in research and development expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of   September 30, 2016  , there are no remaining research and development milestones to be achieved. 
  The Company recorded contingent consideration of   $0.4 million   related to the acquisition of Immutopics, Inc. ("Immutopics") in March 2016 as discussed in Note 11. 
   
  Note 10. Fair Value Measurements 
  The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the following periods (in thousands): 

There were   no   transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 categories of the fair value hierarchy during the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Company used Level 1 inputs to determine the fair value of its cash equivalents, which primarily consist of funds held in government money market account and commercial paper. As such, the carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of cash equivalents was   $133.5 million   and   $133.1 million  , respectively. 
  The Company assesses the fair value of contingent consideration to be settled in cash related to acquisitions using a discounted revenue model. Significant assumptions used in the measurement include revenue projections and discount rates. This fair value measurement of contingent consideration is based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company recorded an additional contingent liability of   $0.4 million   for the acquisition of Immutopics (see Note 11). Due to changes in the estimated payments and a shorter discounting period related to the BioHelix contingent consideration, the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities changed during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . These changes resulted in a   $0.6 million   gain recorded to cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . There were   no   changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

Overview 
  We have a leadership position in the development, manufacturing and marketing of rapid diagnostic testing solutions. These diagnostic testing solutions primarily include applications in infectious diseases, women s health and gastrointestinal diseases. We sell our products directly to end users and distributors, in each case, for professional use in physician offices, hospitals, clinical laboratories, reference laboratories, leading universities, retail clinics and wellness screening centers. We market our products in the United States through a network of national and regional distributors, and through a direct sales force. Internationally, we sell and market primarily through distributor arrangements. 
   
  Outlook 
  We continue to realize expansion of our Sofia footprint and molecular platforms. For the remainder of   2016  , we will continue to focus on managing our business and delivering long-term sustainable growth through the creation of a broader-based diagnostic company serving our existing customers as well as targeting larger and faster growing markets. We will continue to invest in research and development, focused on expansion of our Sofia and molecular programs. In addition, we continue to invest in our commercial organization and related marketing programs, in support of recent product launches. We will also continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire new product lines, technologies and companies that would enable us to expand more quickly. 
   
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Total Revenues 
  The following table compares total revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands, except percentages): 

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , total revenue   increased   to   $49.3 million   from   $46.8 million   in the prior period. The Company realized declines in the infectious disease category primarily due to lower Influenza product sales slightly offset with an increase in sales of Strep A products. The increase in the women's health category was driven by our Bone Health, Autoimmune/Complement and Thyretain product lines. The acquisition of Immutopics, Inc. ("Immutopics") contributed to the growth in our Bone Health product line. Royalty, license fees and grant revenue   increased   year over year due primarily to timing of grant revenues associated with the amended Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grant and our Savanna MDx development program.

  Operating Expenses 
  The following table compares operating expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands, except percentages): 

Research and Development Expense 
  Research and development expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased   from $  8.4 million   to $  8.8 million   due primarily to an increase in development spending for the next generation Sofia and the Savanna MDx platform and an increase in clinical trials spending for Solana products. These increases are offset by lower spending for the development of our Lyra products. 
  Research and development expenses include direct external costs, such as fees paid to consultants, and internal direct and indirect costs, such as compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel, supplies and materials, clinical trials and studies, facility costs and depreciation. Our research and development spending will continue to be centered around our immunoassay and molecular platforms. 
   
  Sales and Marketing Expense 
  Sales and marketing expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   from   $12.1 million   to   $11.9 million   compared with the prior year period.  This decrease is due primarily to reduced personnel, travel and training costs slightly offset by additional investments in our Virena platform, which is our wireless cellular instrument management and surveillance system. 
   
  General and Administrative Expense 
  General and administrative expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   from   $5.9 million   to   $6.6 million   compared with the prior period. The increase was due to the integration costs associated with the acquisition of Immutopics and professional services, partially offset by the suspension of the medical device excise tax. General and administrative expense primarily includes personnel costs, information technology, facilities and professional service fees. 
   
  Amortization of Intangible Assets from Acquired Businesses and Technology 
  Amortization of intangible assets from acquired businesses consists of customer relationships, purchased technology and patents and trademarks acquired in connection with our acquisitions of Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc., BioHelix, AnDiaTec, and Immutopics. Amortization of intangibles assets for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $0.1 million   to   $2.3 million   compared with the prior period primarily due to amortization of intangible assets acquired with the Immutopics acquisition in March 2016.

Interest Expense, net 
  Interest expense primarily relates to accrued interest for the coupon and accretion of the discount on our   $172.5 million     3.25%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 ( Convertible Senior Notes ) issued in December 2014 and interest paid on our lease obligation associated with our San Diego McKellar facility. Interest expense was   $3.0 million   for each of the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  
   
  Income Taxes 
  Our effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   35%   and   59%  , respectively. We recognized an income tax benefit of   $0.3 million   and   $1.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. The effective tax rate was higher for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   due to a year to date adjustment for the full year effective tax rate.  
   
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015    
  Total Revenues 
  The following table compares total revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (in thousands, except percentages): 

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , total revenue   decreased   to   $138.8 million   from   $143.7 million   in the prior year. The Company realized declines in the infectious disease category due to lower sales of Influenza and other Respiratory products slightly offset with an increase in sales of Strep A products. The increase in the women's health category was driven by our Bone Health, Autoimmune/Complement and Thyretain product lines. The acquisition of Immutopics contributed to the growth in our Bone Health product line. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , royalty, grant and other revenue   increased   by   $3.1 million   due primarily to timing of grant revenues associated with the amended Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grant and our Savanna MDx development program.  
   
  Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales was   $54.3 million  , or   39%   of total revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to     $53.6 million  , or   37%   of total revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue was primarily driven by the unfavorable product mix, with lower Influenza product sales in the same period as compared to the prior year.

Operating Expenses 
  The following table compares operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands, except percentages): 

Research and Development Expense 
  Research and development expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased   from   $25.6 million   to $  31.2 million   due primarily to an increase in development spending for the Savanna MDx platform and our next generation Sofia instrument and an increase in clinical trials spending for Solana products. These increases are offset by lower spending on development of our Lyra products. 
  Research and development expenses include direct external costs such as fees paid to consultants, and internal direct and indirect costs such as compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel, supplies and materials, clinical trials and studies, facility costs and depreciation.  
   
  Sales and Marketing Expense 
  Sales and marketing expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $0.6 million   to   $36.4 million   compared with the prior year period, due primarily to additional investment in our Virena platform. This increase was partially offset with reduced personnel, travel and training costs as well as lower stock-based compensation expense. 
   
  General and Administrative Expense 
  General and administrative expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   from   $22.0 million   to   $20.5 million   compared with the prior year period. The decline was due primarily to business development expenditures in the prior year period that did not repeat for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as well as the suspension of the medical device excise tax. These decreases were partially offset by increased integration costs associated with the acquisition of Immutopics and stock-based compensation expense. General and administrative expense primarily includes personnel costs, information technology, facilities and professional service fees. 
   
  Amortization of Intangible Assets from Acquired Businesses and Technology 
  Amortization of intangible assets from acquired businesses consists of customer relationships, purchased technology and patents and trademarks acquired in connection with our acquisitions of Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc., BioHelix, AnDiaTec, and Immutopics. Amortization of intangibles assets for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $0.1 million   to   $6.8 million   as compared with the prior period primarily due to amortization of intangible assets acquired with the Immutopics acquisition in March 2016. 
   
  Interest Expense, net 
  Interest expense consists of fees paid to maintain our ability to borrow under the Senior Credit Facility, interest paid on our lease obligation for our San Diego McKellar facility and interest expense associated with our Convertible Senior Notes issued in December 2014. The decrease in interest expense of   $0.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to a gain on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of   $5.2 million   in principal of our Convertible Senior Notes during the first quarter of 2016.

Income Taxes 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , we recognized an income tax benefit of   $7.1 million   and   $3.3 million  , respectively. Our effective tax rates for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   38%   and   36%  , respectively. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the effective tax rate was higher primarily due to the federal research tax credit in 2016. There was no federal research tax credit in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   as the credit provisions of the United States tax code had expired at the end of 2014 and were not reinstated until December 2015.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the principal sources of liquidity consisted of the following (in thousands):    

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $153.4 million   in cash and cash equivalents, a   $38.1 million     decrease   from   December 31, 2015  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased an aggregate of   $24.6 million   in common stock and Convertible Senior Notes and used   $5.1 million   to acquire Immutopics. Our cash requirements fluctuate as a result of numerous factors, such as the extent to which we generate cash from operations, progress in research and development projects, competition and technological developments and the time and expenditures required to obtain governmental approval of our products. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate candidates for new product lines, company or technology acquisitions or technology licensing. If we decide to proceed with any such transactions, we may need to incur additional debt, or issue additional equity, to successfully complete the transactions. 
    
   Our primary source of liquidity, other than our holdings of cash and cash equivalents, has been cash flows from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating, investing, and financing needs. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our near term capital and operating needs for at least the next 12 months. Operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. Our primary short-term needs for capital, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to:     
             
    support of commercialization efforts related to our current and future products, including support of our direct sales force and field support resources both in the United States and abroad;  
                
    the continued advancement of research and development efforts;  
                
    acquisitions of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities;  
                
    repurchases of our outstanding common stock or Convertible Senior Notes;  
                
    potential strategic acquisitions and investments; and 
                
    repayments of our lease obligation. 
     In December 2014, we issued Convertible Senior Notes in the aggregate principle amount of   $172.5 million  . The Convertible Senior Notes have a coupon rate of   3.25%   and are due 2020. The Convertible Senior Notes were not convertible as of   September 30, 2016  . For detailed information of the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report under the heading  3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020,  which is incorporated by reference herein. 
  On August 10, 2012, we entered into an amended and restated   $140.0 million   Senior Credit Facility that matures on August 10, 2017.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility and due to the limitations of the interest coverage ratio, we had no borrowing capacity under the Senior Credit Facility. At the current time, we do not anticipate the need in the near term to utilize the Senior Credit Facility. For detailed information of the terms of the Senior Credit Facility see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report under the heading  Line of Credit,  which is incorporated by reference herein.

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , we have   $5.1 million   in fair value of contingent considerations associated with prior acquisitions to be settled in future periods.  
    
  In January 2016, our board of directors authorized an amendment to replenish the amount available to repurchase up to an aggregate of   $50.0 million   in shares of common stock or Convertible Senior Notes under our share repurchase program. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we used   $19.6 million   to repurchase our outstanding shares under the share repurchase program and   $4.5 million   to repurchase   $5.2 million   in principal amount of our outstanding Convertible Senior Notes. 
    
  We received   $2.4 million   and   $2.8 million   during the year ended December 31, 2015 and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, pursuant to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grant agreement, which was restricted as to use until expenditures contemplated in the grant were incurred or committed. We recorded this restricted cash as a current asset as we anticipated making expenditures under the grant within one year. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   no   restricted cash. 
    
  We expect our revenue and operating expenses will significantly impact our cash management decisions. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including:  
             
    our ability to successfully realize revenue growth from our new technologies and create innovative products in our markets;  
                
    leveraging our operating expenses to realize operating profits as we grow revenue; 
                
    competing technological and market developments; and  
                
    the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings.  
       
  Cash Flow Summary   

  Cash used by operating activities was $  4.8 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The major contributions to the use of cash during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were a net loss of   $11.9 million  , a change in deferred tax assets and liabilities of   $7.4 million   and a net working capital use of   $9.7 million  . Offsetting this use of cash was the add back of non-cash items of   $27.7 million   associated with depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , operating activities generated cash of   $20.3 million  . The add back of non-cash items was   $27.5 million   related to depreciation, amortization and stock based compensation. Working capital also had a cash contribution of   $3.6 million  . Offsetting these cash generating activities was a net loss of   $5.7 million   and a change in deferred tax assets and liabilities of   $6.4 million  .  
  Our investing activities used   $12.9 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . We used $5.1 million for the acquisition of Immutopics as more fully described in    Note 11    in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Our investing activities also used   $7.9 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily for the acquisition of production equipment, Sofia instruments available for lease and building improvements. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we spent   $12.0 million   on the acquisition of production equipment, Sofia instruments available for lease and building improvements. 
  We are planning approximately $4.5 million in capital expenditures for the remainder of   2016  . The primary purpose for our capital expenditures is to acquire manufacturing and scientific equipment, to purchase or develop information technology, and to implement facility improvements. We plan to fund these capital expenditures with the cash on our balance sheet. 
  Cash used by financing activities was   $20.4 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , of which   $20.1 million   was used for repurchases of common stock primarily related to our share repurchase program, and   $4.5 million   was used for the repurchase of Convertible Senior Notes. These amounts were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of

     Table of Contents  

common stock of   $4.8 million  . Cash used by financing activities was   $26.6 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due to   $27.2 million   used for repurchases of common stock primarily related to our share repurchase program. Additionally, we made payments of debt issuance costs of   $0.4 million   and payments on the lease obligation of   $0.4 million  . These amounts were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of   $2.2 million  .  
   
  Seasonality 
  Sales of our infectious disease products are subject to, and significantly affected by, the seasonal demands of the cold and flu seasons, prevalent during the fall and winter. As a result of these seasonal demands, we typically experience lower sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, and typically have higher sales in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Historically, sales of our infectious disease products have varied from year to year based in large part on the severity, length and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season.  
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any relationships or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partners, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 
   
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Information about recently adopted and proposed accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report under the heading  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  and is incorporated by reference herein. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, software development costs, stock-based compensation, restructuring, contingencies and litigation, contingent consideration, the fair value of the debt component of the convertible debt instruments, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
  A comprehensive discussion of our critical accounting policies and management estimates is included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  ITEM 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We had no borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facility at   September 30, 2016  . If we had borrowings under the credit facility, the interest rate would have been 1.78% as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  We are not subject to interest rate risk on our Convertible Senior Notes as the notes have a fixed interest rate of   3.25%  . For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates will generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. 
  The Company s current investment policy with respect to cash and cash equivalents focuses on maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk and liquidity. Although the Company continually evaluates the placement of investments, as of  
  
   24 

     Table of Contents  

September 30, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents were placed in government money market account, commercial paper or overnight funds that we believe are highly liquid and not subject to material market fluctuation risk. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
  The majority of our international sales are negotiated for and paid in U.S. dollars. Nonetheless, these sales are subject to currency risks, since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the U.S. dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive. These exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact international sales of our products, as could changes in the general economic conditions in those markets. Continued change in the values of the Euro, the Japanese Yen and other foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar could have an impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not currently hedge against exchange rate fluctuations, which means that we are fully exposed to exchange rate changes. In addition, we have agreements with a number of foreign vendors whereby we evenly share the foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk. We may, in the future, enter into similar such arrangements. 
   
  ITEM 4.    Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures:   We have performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting:   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Quidel Corporation; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
