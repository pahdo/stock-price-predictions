  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited)  
   
  1.                   Basis of Presentation 
    
  The consolidated condensed financial statements of Cintas Corporation (Cintas, the Company, we, us or our) included herein have been prepared by Cintas, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  While we believe that the disclosures are adequately presented, it is suggested that these consolidated condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   May 31, 2016  . A summary of our significant accounting policies is presented beginning on page 36 of that report. There have been no material changes in the accounting policies followed by Cintas during the current fiscal year other than the adoption of new accounting pronouncements discussed in Note 2.   
    
  Interim results are subject to variations and are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full fiscal year. In the opinion of management, adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated results of the interim periods shown have been made. 
    
  Cintas' investment in the Shred-it Partnership (Shred-it) and the shredding business (Shredding) are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented as a result of the sale of Shred-it during fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2015, Cintas sold its document imaging and retention services (Storage) business and, as a result, its operations are also classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 12 entitled Discontinued Operations for more information.  
    
  As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   May 31, 2016  , inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. Inventory is comprised of the following amounts at:  

2.                   New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08,  Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,  which amended accounting guidance related to the reporting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. The amended guidance changes the thresholds for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations and requires additional disclosures. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and is required to be applied prospectively. Cintas adopted ASU 2014-08 during the quarter ended August 31, 2015 and applied the amended accounting guidance to Shred-it and will apply it to future transactions, as appropriate. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," to clarify revenue recognition principles. This guidance is intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices. Improved disclosures under the amended guidance relate to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized from contracts with customers. This guidance will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and will be required to be applied retrospectively. Early application of the amendments in this update is not permitted. Cintas is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated condensed financial statements.  

7 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs." ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the consolidated condensed balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The guidance is applied retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. Cintas adopted ASU 2015-03 during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 and has applied this amended accounting guidance to its long-term debt and other assets for all periods presented. The impact of this change in accounting principle on balances previously reported as of May 31, 2016 was a reclassification of   $5.6 million   from other assets to long-term liabilities.  
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.  This amendment eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. This amendment became effective for Cintas beginning June 1, 2016, and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard. The adoption of this amendment did not have an effect on our consolidated condensed financial statements for the quarter ended August 31, 2016.   
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),  which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. Topic 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, Accounting Standard Codification 840, "Leases." This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, however early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that  exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Cintas is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated condensed financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." ASU 2016-09 is intended to simplify accounting for share-based payments. Upon adoption, ASU 2016-09 requires that excess tax benefits for share-based payments be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense and reflected within operating cash flows rather than being recorded within equity and reflected within financing cash flows. The standard also permits the repurchase of more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. ASU 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, however early adoption is permitted. Cintas adopted ASU 2016-09 during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 and elected to make an accounting policy change to recognize forfeitures as they occur. The adoption impact on the consolidated condensed balance sheet was a cumulative-effect adjustment of   $26.7 million  , increasing opening retained earnings and decreasing paid-in capital. The impact of the adoption on the consolidated condensed income statement was a decrease of   $17.2 million   in income taxes. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, our excess tax benefit is no longer included in our calculation of diluted shares under the treasury stock method, resulting in an increase of   0.8 million   shares in the effect of dilutive securities for the three months ended August 31, 2016. The election to recognize forfeitures as they occur resulted in an increase of   $1.7 million   in stock based compensation for the three months ended August 31, 2016. 
    
  No other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material 
  impact on Cintas' consolidated condensed financial statements.

3.                   Fair Value Measurements 
    
  All financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) have been classified within the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value at the consolidated condensed balance sheet date. These financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:  

Cintas  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial instruments classified as Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets, and financial instruments classified as Level 2 are based on quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. The types of financial instruments Cintas classifies within Level 1 include most bank deposits and money market securities. Cintas does not adjust the quoted market price for such financial instruments. 
    
  The types of financial instruments Cintas classifies within Level 2 are primarily high grade domestic commercial paper and Canadian treasury securities (federal). The valuation technique used for Cintas  marketable securities classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy is primarily the market approach. The primary inputs to value Cintas  marketable securities are the respective instrument's future cash flows based on its stated yield and the amount a market participant would pay for a similar instrument. Primarily all of Cintas  marketable securities are actively traded and the recorded fair value reflects current market conditions. However, due to the inherent volatility in the investment market, there is at least a possibility that recorded investment values may change in the near term. 
    
  The funds invested in Canadian treasury securities are not presently expected to be repatriated, but instead are expected to be invested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries. Interest, realized gains and losses and declines in value determined to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income or expense. The cost of the securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The amortized cost basis of marketable securities as of   August 31, 2016   and   May 31, 2016   was   $64.6 million   and   $70.4 million  , respectively. All outstanding marketable securities as of   August 31, 2016   and   May 31, 2016   had contractual maturities due within   one   year. 
    
  At both   August 31, 2016   and   May 31, 2016  , long-term accrued liabilities include interest rate lock agreements. The fair value of Cintas'  interest rate lock agreements are based on similar exchange traded derivatives (market approach)  
  
   9 

and are, therefore, included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. All other amounts included in long-term liabilities are not recorded at fair value.  
    
  The methods described above may produce a fair value that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while Cintas believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the consolidated condensed balance sheet date. 
  In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company records assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required under GAAP. The Company's acquisition of ZEE Medical Inc. (ZEE) on August 1, 2015 was recorded at fair value. See Note 9 entitled Acquisitions for additional information on the measurement of the ZEE assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  

4.                   Investments 
    
  Investments at   August 31, 2016   of   $140.9 million   include the cash surrender value of insurance policies of   $121.2 million  , equity method investments of   $14.7 million  , and cost method investments of   $5.0 million  . Investments at   May 31, 2016   of   $125.0 million   include the cash surrender value of insurance policies of   $108.1 million  , equity method investments of   $14.5 million   and cost method investments of   $2.4 million  .  
    
  Investments are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or when indicators of impairment exist. For the   three months ended     August 31, 2016   and   2015  ,   no   impairment losses were recorded.  

5.                   Earnings Per Share 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations using the two-class method for amounts attributable to Cintas  common shares:  

10 

Basic and diluted losses per share from discontinued operations were   $0.05   for the three months ended   August 31, 2015  . For the three months ended   August 31, 2016   and   2015  , options granted to purchase   0.7 million   and   0.5 million   shares of Cintas common stock, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. The exercise prices of these options were greater than the average market price of the common stock (anti-dilutive). 
  On August 4, 2015, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new   $500.0 million   share buyback program. In June 2016, we purchased less than   0.1 million   shares at an average price of   $94.09   per share for a total purchase price of   $3.7 million  . This completed the August 4, 2015 program through which Cintas purchased a total of   5.7 million   shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of   $87.89   per share for a total purchase price of   $500.0 million  . On August 2, 2016, Cintas announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new   $500.0 million   share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date. 
  For the   three months ended     August 31, 2016  , Cintas acquired   0.2 million   shares of Cintas common stock for employee payroll taxes due on restricted stock awards that vested during the   three months ended     August 31, 2016  . These shares were acquired at an average price of   $99.67   per share for a total purchase price of   $15.1 million  . 

6.                   Goodwill, Service Contracts and Other Assets 
    
  Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill and service contracts for the   three months ended     August 31, 2016  , by reportable operating segment and All Other, are as follows: 

Information regarding Cintas  service contracts and other assets is as follows: 

11 

Amortization expense for continuing operations was   $3.5 million   and   $3.6 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   and August 31,   2015  , respectively. Estimated amortization expense for continuing operations, excluding any future acquisitions, for each of the next five full fiscal years is   $14.7 million  ,   $12.6 million  ,   $12.1 million  ,   $11.6 million   and   $9.7 million  , respectively.  

7.                   Debt, Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
    
  Cintas' senior notes are recorded at cost, net of debt issuance costs. The fair value of the senior notes is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on general market prices. The carrying value and fair value of Cintas' senior notes as of   August 31, 2016   were   $1,050.0 million   and   $1,185.1   million, respectively, and as of   May 31, 2016   were   $1,300.0 million   and   $1,416.6   million, respectively. On June 1, 2016, Cintas paid the   $250.0 million   five-year senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.  
    
  Cintas  commercial paper program has a capacity of   $450.0 million   that is fully supported by a backup revolving credit facility through a credit agreement with its banking group. This revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of   $600.0 million  . On June 23, 2016, the revolving credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date from May 28, 2019 to June 22, 2021, increase the capacity from   $300.0 million   to   $450.0 million   and add an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of   $600.0 million  . As of   August 31, 2016  , there was   $163.8 million   of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of   0.74%   and maturity dates less than   30   days. The carrying value approximates fair value.   No   commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding as of   May 31, 2016  .  
    
  Cintas uses interest rate locks to manage our overall interest expense as interest rate locks effectively change the interest rate of specific debt issuances. The treasury locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable  movements in the benchmark treasury rate related to forecasted debt issuances. Cintas used interest rate lock agreements to hedge against movements in the treasury rates at the time Cintas issued its senior notes in fiscal 2007, fiscal 2008, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2013. The amortization of the cash flow hedges resulted in an increase to other comprehensive income of   $0.4 million   and   $0.5 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, Cintas entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a notional value of   $550.0 million   for a forecasted debt issuance. As of   August 31, 2016   and   May 31, 2016  , the the fair value of this treasury lock was   $38.8 million   and   $19.6 million  , respectively and is recorded in long-term liabilities and as a decrease to other comprehensive income, net of tax. The interest rate lock had no impact on net income or cash flows from continuing operations for the three months ending August 31, 2016.  
    
  Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit Cintas  ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas  assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all debt covenants for all periods presented. 
    
  On August 15, 2016, the Company entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) pursuant to which the Company will acquire all outstanding shares of G K Services, Inc (G K Services) for   $97.50   per share in cash, for a total enterprise value of approximately   $2.2 billion  , including acquired net debt. It is expected that this acquisition will be financed with short and long-term debt.  To that end, the credit agreement that supports the commercial paper program was amended on September 16, 2016. The amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from   $450.0 million   to   $600.0 million   and added a   $250.0 million   term loan facility. The   $150.0 million   increase  
  
   12 

in the revolving credit facility will take effect on the earlier date of either the consummation of the merger (Merger) contemplated by the Merger Agreement among the Corporation, G K Services and Bravo Merger Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cintas, dated as of August 15, 2016, or the date on which the Merger Agreement is validly terminated. The term loan facility shall be only funded upon the consummation of the Merger. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under either the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility of up to   $250.0 million   in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The amendment also extended the maturity date of the agreement to September 15, 2021.  

8.                   Income Taxes 
    
  In the normal course of business, Cintas provides for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest accordingly. During the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , unrecognized tax benefits increased by approximately   $0.1 million   and accrued interest increased by approximately   $0.2 million  .  
    
  All U.S. federal income tax returns are closed to audit through fiscal 2011. Cintas is currently in advanced stages of its U.S. federal audit and various audits in certain foreign jurisdictions and certain domestic states. The years under foreign and domestic state audits cover fiscal years back to 2009. Based on the resolution of the various audits and other potential regulatory developments, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by   $2.6 million   for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2017. 
    
  The majority of Cintas' operations are in North America. Cintas is required to file federal income tax returns, as well as state income tax returns in a majority of the domestic states and also in certain Canadian provinces. At times, Cintas is subject to audits in these jurisdictions. The audits, by nature, are sometimes complex and can require several years to resolve. The final resolution of any such tax audit could result in either a reduction in Cintas' accruals or an increase in its income tax provision, either of which could have an impact on the consolidated condensed results of operations in any given period.

9.                   Acquisitions 
  On August 1, 2015, the Company acquired all of the shares of ZEE for acquisition-date fair value consideration of  $134.0 million  , consisting of cash of   $120.6 million   and contingent consideration, subject to certain holdback provisions of   $13.4 million  . ZEE operates within the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. This acquisition has expanded our footprint in van delivered first aid, safety, training and emergency products and will allow us to serve an even greater number of customers in North America. 
  The table below summarizes the final purchase price allocation of ZEE as determined by management with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. None of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are valued at the estimated fair value at the acquisition date as required by GAAP. 

The estimated useful life of the acquired service contracts is   10   years. 
  Cintas is required to provide additional disclosures about fair value measurements as part of the consolidated financial statements for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (including business acquisitions). The working capital assets and liabilities, as well as the property and equipment acquired, were valued using Level 2 inputs which included data points that are observable, such as definitive sales agreements, appraisals or established market values of comparable assets (market approach). Goodwill, service contracts and other intangibles were valued using Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable by nature, and included internal estimates of future cash flow using a discount rate of   11%   (income approach).  
  The results of operations for the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated condensed statements of income from the dates of acquisition. The proforma revenue, net income and earnings per share information relating to acquired businesses are not presented because they are not significant to Cintas. 
  On August 15, 2016, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement pursuant to which the Company will acquire all outstanding shares of G K Services for   $97.50   per share in cash, for a total enterprise value of approximately   $2.2 billion  , including acquired net debt. The completion of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including, without limitation: the adoption of the Merger by G K Services  shareholders; the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; the receipt of Canadian antitrust approvals; the absence of any order, law or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing or prohibiting completion of the Merger; subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of representations and warranties of the Company, Merger Sub and G K Services; and the performance or compliance by the Company, Merger Sub and G K Services with their respective covenants and agreements. The Merger has not closed as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q.

With products and services including uniforms, floor care, restroom supplies, first aid and safety products, fire extinguishers and testing, and safety and compliance training, Cintas helps customers get   Ready for the Workday . 
  We are North America s leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs, as well as a significant provider of related business services, including entrance mats, restroom cleaning services and supplies, carpet and tile cleaning services, first aid and safety services and fire protection products and services. 
    
  Cintas  principal objective is  to exceed customers  expectations in order to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for shareholders and working partners,  and it provides the framework and focus for Cintas  business strategy. This strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all of our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include business segments to which we have not historically served. We will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers. 
    
  To pursue the strategy of increasing penetration, we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis. This frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships. The combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services. 
    
  We pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in several ways. Cintas has a national sales organization introducing all of its products and services to prospects in all business segments. Our broad range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect. We also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion, especially in our first aid and safety service reportable operating segment and fire protection businesses. Finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Cintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an All Other category. Cintas  two reportable operating segments are Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops, and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies and carpet and tile cleaning services are also provided within this operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services operating segment consists of first aid and safety services. The remainder of Cintas  business, which consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and its Direct Sale business, is included in All Other. These reporting units consist of fire protection products and services and the direct sale of uniforms and related items. Revenue and income before income taxes for the   three months ended     August 31, 2016   and 2015 for the two reportable operating segments and All Other is presented in Note 11 entitled Segment Information of  Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.  
    
  On August 1, 2015, the Company acquired all of the shares of ZEE Medical Inc. (ZEE), a first aid, safety, training and emergency products business that is included in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. See Note 9 entitled Acquisitions for additional information.  
  On August 15, 2016, the Company entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) pursuant to which the Company will acquire all outstanding shares of G K Services, Inc. (G K Services) for $97.50 per share in cash, for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.2 billion, including acquired net debt. The completion of the merger (Merger) is subject to customary conditions, including, without limitation: the adoption of the Merger by G K Services  shareholders; the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; the receipt of Canadian antitrust approvals; the absence of any order, law or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing or prohibiting completion of the Merger; subject to certain

exceptions, the accuracy of representations and warranties of the Company, Bravo Merger Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub) a wholly-own subsidiary of Cintas and G K Services; and the performance or compliance by the Company, Merger Sub and G K Services with their respective covenants and agreements.  
    
  Consolidated Results 
    
  Three Months Ended     August 31, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended     August 31, 2015 
    
  Total revenue increased   7.9%   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   over the same period in the prior fiscal year, from   $1,198.9 million   to   $1,294.1 million  . Revenue increased organically by 5.7% as a result of increased sales volume. Organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Total revenue was positively impacted by 2.3% due to acquisitions and negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the three-months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the three-months ended   August 31, 2015  . 
    
  Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased   6.5%   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   over the same period in the prior fiscal year, from   $938.4 million   to   $999.6 million  . Revenue increased organically by 5.9%. Revenue growth was negatively impacted 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and positively impacted 0.7% due to acquisitions in the three-months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Growth was driven by many factors including new business sold by sales representatives and penetration of additional products and services into existing customers.   
    
  Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased   13.1%   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, from   $260.5 million   to   $294.5 million  . Revenue increased organically by 5.2%. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The remaining 8.0% increase represents growth derived through acquisitions in our First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and  our Fire Protection business, which is included in All Other.  
      
  Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased   $22.4 million  , or   4.3%  , for the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   August 31, 2015  . This increase was due to higher Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment sales volume.  
     
  Cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety, uniforms, and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased   $13.2 million  , or   8.4%  , for the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   August 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to higher First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other sales volume.  
    
  Selling and administrative expenses increased   $35.4 million  , or   10.5%  , for the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The majority of the increase was due to higher Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment sales volume, increased employee-partner related expenses and increased costs as a result of the SAP implementation and ZEE acquisition.  
    
  Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was   $14.1 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , compared to   $16.3 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to payment of the $250 million five-year 2.85% coupon senior notes that matured on June 1, 2016 with cash on hand and the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. The average amount of commercial paper outstanding during the period was $197.8 million and the weighted average interest rate applicable to the outstanding commercial paper was approximately 0.66%, which are both lower than the five-year senior notes that matured. 
    
  Cintas  effective tax rate on continuing operations was   28.4%   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   and   37.2%   for the three months ended   August 31, 2015  . The rate was benefited in the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , primarily as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."  Impact from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 was a decrease of $17.2 million in  income taxes. 
  
   28 

Net income from continuing operations for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   increased   $31.9 million  , or   30.0%  , compared to the three months ended   August 31, 2015  . Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was   $1.26   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , which was an increase of   35.5%   compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased due to the increase in earnings from continuing operations combined with the decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding. The decrease in common shares outstanding resulted from purchasing 6.4 million shares of common stock under the January 13, 2015 and August 4, 2015 share buyback programs since the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2016 through the first quarter of fiscal 2017.   
     
  Uniform Rental and Facility Services Reportable Operating Segment 
    
  Three Months Ended     August 31, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended     August 31, 2015 
    
  Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased from   $938.4 million   to   $999.6 million  , or   6.5%  , for the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , over the same period in the prior fiscal year, and the cost of uniform rental and facility services increased   $22.4 million  , or   4.3%  . The reportable operating segment s gross margin was   $458.7 million  , or   45.9%   of revenue. The gross margin was 120 basis points higher than the prior fiscal year s first quarter gross margin of   44.7%  . Lower energy-related expenses increased gross margin by 30 basis points. The remaining increase was driven by new business sold by sales representatives, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and continuous improvement in process efficiency.  
    
  Selling and administrative expenses increased $18.9 million to 27.4% of revenue, compared to 27.1% in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. This increase in expense was due primarily to increased employee-partner related expenses and SAP implementation expenses. 
    
  Income before income taxes increased   $19.9 million  , or 12.0%, for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Income before income taxes was   18.5%   of the reportable operating segment s revenue, which was a 90 basis point increase compared to the first quarter of the prior fiscal year of   17.6%  . This increase was due to the increase in gross margin, partially offset by the increase in selling and administrative expenses as previously discussed. 
    
  First Aid and Safety Services Reportable Operating Segment 
    
  Three Months Ended     August 31, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended     August 31, 2015 
    
  First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment revenue increased from   $99.5 million   to   $124.8 million  , or   25.5%  , for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   over the same period in the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased organically by 5.4% as a result of increased sales volume. The remaining 20.1% difference in growth rates represents growth derived through acquisitions, primarily the ZEE acquisition on August 1, 2015.  
    
  Cost of first aid and safety services increased $10.3 million, or 18.0%, for the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , over the three months ended   August 31, 2015  , due to increased sales volume and higher costs associated with the ZEE acquisition. The gross margin as a percent of revenue was 45.8% for the quarter ended   August 31, 2016  , which is an increase of 350 basis points compared to the gross margin as a percent of revenue of 42.3% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was driven primarily by improved sourcing and from leveraging of existing warehouses as a result of the ZEE acquisition. 
    
  Selling and administrative expenses increased $12.1 million to 36.5% of revenue, compared to 33.7% in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. The increase was due primarily to increased labor and other employee-partner related expenses as a result of the ZEE acquisition.  
    
  Income before income taxes for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased $2.9 million to $11.5 million for the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, due to the increase in revenue from both organic growth and the ZEE acquisition. Income before income taxes, at 9.2% of the reportable operating segment s revenue, was a 60 basis point increase compared to the same quarter last fiscal year due to the reasons previously mentioned.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  The following is a summary of our cash flows and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of and for the   three months ended     August 31, 2016   and   2015  : 

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of   August 31, 2016   and   2015   include $88.3 million and $80.8 million, respectively, that is located outside of the United States. We expect to use these amounts to fund our international operations and international expansion activities.  
    
  Cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt and short-term borrowings, to fund growth and expansion opportunities, as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock.  
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $157.6 million   for the   three months ended     August 31, 2016  , an increase of   $14.5 million   compared to the same period last fiscal year. The increase was primarily the result of higher net income offset by changes in working capital.   
    
  Net cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures were   $78.6 million   and   $62.6 million   for the   three months ended     August 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Current year capital expenditures primarily relate to expansion efforts in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, representing $66.5 million of the current year outflow. Cash paid for acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired was   $11.0 million   and   $121.4 million   for the   three months ended     August 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The acquisitions during the   three months ended     August 31, 2016   occurred in our Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and our Fire Protection business, which is included in All Other. Cash paid for acquisition of businesses net of cash acquired during the three months ended   August 31, 2015   included the acquisition of ZEE. For the three months ended August 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by $24.4 million of cash received from the sale of Storage related assets classified as held for sale.  Net cash provided by investing activities also include purchases of marketable securities and investments of $10.1 million and $43.1 million for the   three months ended     August 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $97.0 million   and   $209.7 million   for the   three months ended     August 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. On January 13, 2015, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date. During the first three months of fiscal 2016, under the January 13, 2015 program, we purchased 2.4 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $85.65 per share for a total purchase price of $202.5 million. From the inception of the January 13, 2015 share buyback program through the completion of the program in September 2015, Cintas purchased a total of 5.9 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $84.07 per share for a total purchase price of $500.0 million. On August 4, 2015, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million share buyback program. During the three months ended August 31, 2016, under the August 4, 2015 share buyback plan, we purchased 0.1 million shares at an average price of $94.11 per share for a total purchase price of $3.7 million. This completed the August 4, 2015 program through which Cintas purchased a total of 5.7 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $87.89 for a total purchase price of $500.0 million. On August 2, 2016, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new $500.0 million share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date. There were no share buybacks subsequent to   August 31, 2016   through   October 11, 2016  . In addition, for the   three months ended     August 31, 2016  , Cintas acquired   0.2 million   shares of Cintas common stock for employee payroll taxes due on restricted stock awards that vested during the   three months ended     August 31, 2016  . These shares were acquired at an average price of   $99.67   per share for a total purchase price of   $15.1 million  .

During the   three months ended     August 31, 2016  , Cintas paid $8.6 million in prepaid short term debt financing fees related to bridge loan financing in connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Cintas will acquire all outstanding shares of G K Services for $97.50 per share in cash, for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.2 billion, including acquired net debt.  
    
  On June 1, 2016, Cintas paid the $250.0 million five-year senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. As of   August 31, 2016  , we had $1,044.6 million aggregate principal amount in fixed rate senior notes outstanding, net of $5.4 million of deferred financing fees, with maturities ranging from 2017 to 2036.  
    
  Cintas  commercial paper program has a capacity of $450.0 million that is fully supported by a backup revolving credit facility through a credit agreement with its banking group. This revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The revolving credit facility has a maturity date of June 22, 2021. We believe that this program, along with cash generated from operations, will be adequate to provide necessary funding for our future cash requirements. As of   August 31, 2016  , there was   $163.8 million   aggregate principal amount of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.74% and maturity dates less than 30 days. No commercial paper or borrowings under our revolving credit facility were outstanding as of   May 31, 2016  . 
    
  On August 15, 2016, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement pursuant to which the Company will acquire all outstanding shares of G K Services for $97.50 per share in cash, for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.2 billion, including acquired net debt. It is expected that this acquisition will be financed with short and long-term debt.  To that end, the credit agreement that supports the commercial paper program was amended on September 16, 2016. The amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $450.0 million to $600.0 million and added a $250.0 million term loan facility. The $150.0 million increase in the revolving credit facility will take effect on the earlier date of either the consummation of the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement among the Corporation, G K Services and Merger Sub dated as of August 15, 2016, or the date on which the Merger Agreement is validly terminated. The term loan facility shall only be funded upon the consummation of the Merger. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under either the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The amendment also extended the maturity date of the agreement to September 15, 2021.  
    
  Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. As of   August 31, 2016  , Cintas was in compliance with all debt covenants. 
    
  Our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity.  We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. Our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. As of   August 31, 2016  , our ratings were as follows: 
                           Rating Agency 
      
    Outlook 
      
    Commercial Paper 
      
    Long-term Debt 

Standard   Poor s 
      
    Stable 
      
    A-2 
      
    BBB+ 
      Moody s Investors Service 
      
    Under Review * 
      
    P-1 
      
    A2 

*   The rating is under review for possible downgrade following the announcement of the all-debt financed Merger. The rating review will focus on the expected post-acquisition capital structure, merger integration plans, projected operating performance and credit metrics, the expected pace of debt reduction and the impact of regulatory requirements to close the transaction, among other factors. 
    
  In the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. In addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of  
  
   31 

commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. 
    
  To monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. One such factor is the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, obligations under capital leases due in one year, long-term debt and long-term obligations under capital leases.   

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Cintas is subject to legal proceedings, insurance receipts, legal settlements and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operation of Cintas.

ITEM 3. 
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
    
  In our normal operations, Cintas has market risk exposure to interest rates. There has been no material change to this market risk exposure to interest rates from that which was previously disclosed on page 26 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   May 31, 2016  . 
    
  Through its foreign operations, Cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign currency denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. The primary foreign currency to which Cintas is exposed is the Canadian dollar.   

ITEM 4. 
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  With the participation of Cintas  management, including Cintas  Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Controllers, Cintas has evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)) as of   August 31, 2016  .  Based on such evaluation, Cintas  management, including Cintas  Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Controllers, has concluded that Cintas  disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   August 31, 2016  , in ensuring (i) information required to be disclosed by Cintas in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) information required to be disclosed by Cintas in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Cintas  management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in Cintas  internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended   August 31, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Cintas  internal control over financial reporting. See  Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  and  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  on pages 28 through 30 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   May 31, 2016  .
