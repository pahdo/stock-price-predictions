   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     
   (Unaudited)   
   ( In thousands, except share and per share amounts )   
     
   1.                   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
     
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and the requirements of Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of BioTelemetry, Inc. s ( BioTelemetry,   Company,   we,   our  or  us  ) financial position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the results of operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the consolidated financial statements related to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited.  The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period.  
     
    Net Income Per Share    
     
  We compute net income per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 260,  Earnings Per Share.   Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per share is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common shares, including stock options and restricted stock units.  
     
  The following table presents the calculation of basic net income per share:  

Certain stock options, which are priced higher than the market price of our shares as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, would be anti-dilutive and therefore have been excluded from the weighted average shares used in computing diluted net income per share. These options could become dilutive in future periods.  
     
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
     
  The fair value of financial instruments is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.  We have financial instruments falling into all three levels of the fair value hierarchy.  Our Level 1 financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other accounts receivable and accounts payable.  The carrying value of these financial instruments approximates their fair value because of their short-term nature.  Long-term debt, which is given a Level 2 classification within the fair value hierarchy, was determined to have a fair value of $37,767 as of September 30, 2016. This is equal to the nominal value, which is the carrying value, exclusive of debt discount and deferred charges.

Table of Contents   
     
  The fair value of contingent consideration, which is a Level 3 fair value instrument, is measured on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs such as projected payment dates, probabilities of meeting specified milestones and other such variables resulting in payment amounts which are discounted back to present value using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model.  
     
  In addition to our recurring fair value measurements, we have assets acquired in connection with business combinations, which are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date using a discounted cash flow model, which is a Level 3 classification.  This valuation technique requires the Company to make certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, future operating performance and cash flows, royalty rates and other such variables which are discounted to present value using a discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with future operating cash flow of the acquired business, the characteristics of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the experience of the acquired business.  
     
    Equity Method Investments    
     
  We account for investments using the equity method of accounting if the investment provides us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company s ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee ranges between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on the investee s board of directors, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under the equity method of accounting, the investment is recorded at cost in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets and is periodically adjusted for capital contributions, dividends received and our share of the investee s earnings or losses together with other-than-temporary impairments which are recorded as a component of interest and other loss, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  
     
  In December 2015, we acquired an ownership interest in Well Bridge Health, Inc. ( WellBridge ) through the conversion of an outstanding note receivable and the related accrued interest.  The investment is accounted for under the equity method.  At the time of the acquisition, the equity method basis difference of $891 was allocated to equity method goodwill.  As of September 30, 2016, our investment in WellBridge represented 32% of the outstanding stock.   A summary of our investment in Wellbridge is as follows: 

Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets    
     
  Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.  In accordance with ASC 350,  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other  ( ASC 350 ), goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or when events arise that could indicate that an impairment exists.  The provisions of ASC 350 require that we perform a two-step impairment test.  In the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of the reporting units.  If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceeds the fair value of the reporting units, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units  goodwill.  If the carrying value of the reporting units  goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded.  
     
  For the purpose of performing our goodwill impairment analysis, we consider our business to be comprised of three reporting units:  Healthcare, Research and Technology.  We calculate the fair value of the reporting units utilizing a weighting of the income and market approaches.  The income approach is based on a discounted cash flow methodology that includes assumptions for, among other things, forecasted income, cash flow, growth rates, income tax rates, expected tax benefits and long-term discount rates, all of which require significant judgment.  The market approach utilizes our market data.  There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and the judgment applied in the analysis.  We believe that the combination of an income and a market approach provides a reasonable basis to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.  
     
  Acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. The estimated fair values and useful lives of intangible assets are determined by assessing many factors including estimates of future operating performance and cash flow of the acquired business, the characteristics of the intangible assets acquired and the experience of the acquired business. Independent appraisal firms may assist with the valuation of acquired assets. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset.

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted    
     
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .  The standard will revise accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases .  The standard will require lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheet and makes selected changes to lessor accounting.  The standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  A modified retrospective transition approach is required, with certain practical expedients available.  We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory .  The standard will require inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  The guidance will not apply to inventories for which cost is determined using the last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method.  The standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which has been updated through several revisions and clarifications since its original issuance.  The standard will require revenue recognized to represent the transfer of promised goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration which a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  The standard also requires new, expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition.  The standard will be effective January 1, 2018 with early adoption permissible beginning January 1, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the transition method we will elect and the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
   2. Acquisitions   
     
    VirtualScopics, Inc   . 
     
  On March 25, 2016, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary BioTelemetry Research Acquisition Corporation, entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger with VirtualScopics, Inc. ( VirtualScopics ), a leading provider of clinical trial imaging solutions.  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company purchased:  (i) any and all outstanding shares of VirtualScopics  $0.001 par value common stock for $4.05 per share; (ii) any and all outstanding shares of VirtualScopics  $0.001 par value Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for $336.30 per share; and (iii) any and all outstanding shares of VirtualScopics  $0.001 par value Series C-1 Convertible Preferred Stock for $920.00 per share.  The all cash acquisition of VirtualScopics was completed on May 11, 2016.  The total consideration paid at closing amounted to $14,970, net of cash acquired of $849.  
     
  The acquisition of VirtualScopics expands the Company s existing clinical research offerings and gives the Company further access to established customer relationships.  We accounted for the transaction as a business combination, and as such, all assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values.  The excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been recognized as goodwill, which represents the expected future benefits arising from the assembled workforce and other synergies attributable to cost savings opportunities.  The Company recognized $4,453 of goodwill as a result of the acquisition, all of which has been assigned to the Research segment.  We do not expect that any of this goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.  
     
  The amounts below represent our preliminary fair value estimates as of September 30, 2016 and are subject to subsequent adjustment as additional information is obtained during the applicable measurement period.  The primary areas of these preliminary estimates that are not yet finalized relate to certain tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the identifiable intangible assets.  The Company expects to finalize all accounting for the acquisition of VirtualScopics within one year of the acquisition date.

  The total consideration and related allocation for VirtualScopics is summarized as follows:  

For the period from May 11, 2016 to September 30, 2016, VirtualScopics contributed revenues of $7,774 and net income of $1,091 to our consolidated results of operations.  
     
  The following unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared using historical financial results of the Company and VirtualScopics as if the acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2015.  Certain adjustments related to the elimination of transaction costs and acquisition related indebtedness, as well as the addition of depreciation and amortization related to fair value adjustments on the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, have been reflected for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma financial information presented below.  No adjustments for synergies or certain other expected benefits of the acquisition have been included.  We believe the assumptions used in preparing the unaudited pro forma financial information are reasonable, but not necessarily indicative of actual results should the acquisitions have occurred on January 1, 2015.  
     
  Pro forma financial information for the periods presented is summarized as follows:

    ePatch Division of DELTA Danish Electronics, Light, and Acoustics    
     
  On April 1, 2016, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary BioTelemetry Technology ApS, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement ( APA ) with DELTA Danish Electronics, Light, and Acoustics ( DELTA ), pursuant to which the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of the ePatch division of DELTA, inclusive of all products and indications currently under development.  The total consideration paid at closing amounted to $3,000 in cash and 244,519 shares of the Company s common stock valued at $2,885.  In addition, there is the potential for a performance based earn out up to $3,000 upon reaching certain milestones, as defined in the APA.  The fair value of the total consideration transferred in the ePatch acquisition, including contingent consideration, was $6,490 at the acquisition date.  
     
  The ePatch acquisition is expected to generate future cost savings for the Company and will provide control over proprietary components for the Company s next generation  Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry TM  ( MCOT TM  ) device.  We accounted for the transaction as a business combination, and as such, all assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values.  The excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been recognized as goodwill, which represents the expected future benefits arising from the assembled workforce and other synergies attributable to cost savings opportunities.  The company recognized $2,965 of goodwill as a result of the acquisition, all of which has been assigned to the Technology segment.  We expect all of this goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes. 
     
  The amounts below represent our preliminary fair value estimates as of September 30, 2016 and are subject to subsequent adjustment as additional information is obtained during the applicable measurement period.  The primary areas of these preliminary estimates that are not yet finalized relate to certain tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the identifiable intangible assets.  The Company expects to finalize all accounting for the ePatch acquisition within one year of the acquisition date.  
     
  The total consideration and related allocation for the ePatch acquisition is summarized as follows:  

While the ePatch acquisition provides control over proprietary components of our next generation cardiac monitoring device, the acquisition did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations.

   8.                   Income Taxes  
     
  The income tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate adjusted for discrete items, if any, which are taken into account in the quarterly period in which they occur.  We review and update our estimated annual effective tax rate each quarter.  At September 30, 2016, our estimated annual effective tax rate was 4.78%.

   Company Background   
     
  We provide cardiac monitoring services, cardiac monitoring device manufacturing and centralized core laboratory services.  We operate under three reportable segments:  Healthcare, Research and Technology.  The Healthcare segment is focused on the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias, or heart rhythm disorders. We offer cardiologists and electrophysiologists a full spectrum of solutions which provides them with a single source of cardiac monitoring services.  These services range from the differentiated Mobile Cardiac Telemetry ( MCT ) service marketed as Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry  TM  ( MCOT TM  ) or External Cardiac Ambulatory Telemetry ( ECAT ), to wireless and trans-telephonic event, Holter, Pacemaker and International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) monitoring.  The Research segment is engaged in central core laboratory services providing cardiac monitoring, imaging, scientific consulting and data management services for pharmaceutical and medical device clinical trials.  The Technology segment focuses on the development, manufacturing, testing and marketing of medical devices to medical companies, clinics and hospitals. 
     
   Recent Acquisitions

  On April 1, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with DELTA Danish Electronics, Light, and Acoustics ( DELTA ), pursuant to which the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of the ePatch division of DELTA, inclusive of all products and indications currently under development.  The total consideration paid at closing amounted to $3.0 million in cash and 244,519 shares of the Company s common stock valued at $2.9 million.  In addition, there is the potential for a performance based earn out up to $3.0 million upon reaching certain milestones, as defined in the APA.  The fair value of the total consideration transferred in the acquisition, including contingent consideration, was $6.5 million at the acquisition date.  
     
   Revenue Recognition   
     
   Healthcare   
     
  Healthcare revenue includes revenue from MCT, wireless and trans-telephonic event, Holter, Pacemaker and INR monitoring services.  We receive a significant portion of our revenue from third-party commercial insurance organizations and governmental entities.  We also receive reimbursement directly from patients through co-pays and self-pay arrangements.  Billings for services reimbursed by contracted third-party payors, including Medicare, are recorded as revenue, net of contractual allowances.  Adjustments to the estimated receipts, based on final settlement with the third-party payors, are recorded upon settlement.  If we do not have sufficient historical information regarding collectability from a given payor to support revenue recognition at the time of service, revenue is recognized when cash is received.  Unearned amounts are appropriately deferred until the service has been completed.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenue from Medicare as a percentage of our Healthcare revenue was 41.5% and 43.0%, respectively.   Revenue from Medicare as a percentage of our Healthcare revenue was 41.6% for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
     
   Research   
     
  Research revenue includes revenue for core laboratory services, including cardiac monitoring, imaging, scientific consulting and data management services.  Our Research revenue is provided on a fee-for-service basis, and revenue is recognized as the related services are performed.  We also provide consulting services on a time and materials basis and this revenue is recognized as the services are performed.  Our site support revenue, consisting of equipment rentals and sales along with related supplies and logistics management, are recognized at the time of sale or over the rental period.  Under a typical contract, customers pay us a portion of our fee for these services upon contract execution as an upfront deposit, some of which is typically non-refundable upon contract termination.  Unearned revenue, including upfront deposits, are deferred, and then recognized as the services are performed.  
     
  For arrangements with multiple deliverables, the revenue is allocated to each element (both delivered and undelivered items) based on their relative selling prices or management s best estimate of their selling prices, when vendor-specific or third-party evidence is unavailable.  
     
  We record reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses incurred, including freight, as revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  
     
   Technology   
     
  Technology revenue includes revenue received from the sale of products, product repairs and supplies to medical companies, clinics and hospitals.  Our Technology revenue is recognized when shipped, or as service is completed.  
     
   Reimbursement - Healthcare   
     
  We are dependent on reimbursement for our patient services by government and commercial insurance payors.  Medicare reimbursement rates for our MCT, event, Holter, Pacemaker and INR monitoring services have been established nationally by the Centers for Medicare  and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) and fluctuate periodically based on the annually published CMS rate table. 
     
  In addition to government reimbursement through Medicare, we have successfully secured contracts with most national and regional commercial payors for our monitoring services.  
     
   Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   
     
   Accounts receivable related to the Healthcare segment are recorded at the time revenue is recognized, net of contractual allowances, and are presented on the consolidated balance sheets net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.  The ultimate collection of accounts receivable may not be known for several months after services have been provided and billed.  We record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of receivables using payor-specific historical data.  The percentages and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods and analyses, including current and    historical cash collections and the aging of receivables by payor.  Because of continuing changes in the healthcare industry and third-party reimbursement, it is possible that our estimates of collectability could change, which could have a material impact on our operations and cash flows. 
     
 17   

Table of Contents   
     
  Other accounts receivable related to the Research and Technology segments are recorded at the time revenue is recognized, or when products are shipped or services are performed.  We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on a specific account basis and consider several factors in our analysis, including customer-specific information and the aging of the account.  
     
  We write-off receivables when the likelihood for collection is remote and when we believe collection efforts have been fully exhausted and we do not intend to devote additional resources in attempting to collect. We perform write-offs on a monthly basis.  In the Healthcare segment, we wrote off $6.3 million and $5.0 million of receivables for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The impact was a reduction of gross receivables and a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts.  There were no material write-offs in the Research and Technology segments.  We recorded bad debt expense of $2.5 million and $7.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. We recorded bad debt expense of $2.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Other Charges   
     
  Other charges are related to litigation, strategic acquisitions, cost reduction programs and reorganizations, as well as other costs that are not considered part of our ongoing business operations.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources

  We generated $26.4 million of cash from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Our ongoing operations during this period resulted in net income of $12.4 million, which included $22.6 million of non-cash items primarily related to bad debt, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense.  These items were partially offset by $8.6 million of cash used for working capital.
