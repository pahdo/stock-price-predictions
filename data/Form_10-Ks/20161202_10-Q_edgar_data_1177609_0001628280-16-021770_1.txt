(1)  
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
      
           (a) 
    Nature of Business 
     Five Below, Inc. (collectively with its wholly owned subsidiary as the "Company") is a specialty value retailer offering merchandise targeted at the teen and pre-teen demographic. The Company offers an edited assortment of products, priced at   $5   and below. In August 2016, the Company commenced selling merchandise on the internet, through the Company's fivebelow.com e-commerce website. 
  The Company s edited assortment of products includes select brands and licensed merchandise. The Company believes its merchandise is readily available, and that there are a number of potential vendors that could be utilized, if necessary, under approximately the same terms the Company is currently receiving; thus, it is not dependent on a single vendor or a group of vendors. 
  The Company is incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and, as of   October 29, 2016  , operated in   31   states that include Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, West Virginia, North Carolina, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Georgia, Texas, Tennessee, Maine, Alabama, Kentucky, Kansas, Florida, South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, Wisconsin, Oklahoma and Minnesota. As of   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , the Company operated   517   stores and   434   stores, respectively, each operating under the name  Five Below.  
   
           (b)  
    Fiscal Year 
     The Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31.   References to "fiscal year 2016" or "fiscal 2016" refer to the period from January 31, 2016 to January 28, 2017 and consists of a 52-week fiscal year. References to "fiscal year 2015" or "fiscal 2015" refer to the period from February 1, 2015 to January 30, 2016 and consists of a 52-week fiscal year. The fiscal quarters ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 refer to the thirteen weeks ended as of those dates. The year-to-date periods ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 refer to the thirty-nine weeks ended as of those dates.     
   
  (c)      Basis of Presentation 
  The consolidated balance sheets as of   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , the consolidated statements of operations for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , the consolidated statement of shareholders  equity for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   have been prepared by the Company in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim reporting and are unaudited. In the opinion of management, the aforementioned financial statements include all known adjustments (which consist primarily of normal, recurring accruals, estimates and assumptions that impact the financial statements) necessary to present fairly the financial position at the balance sheet dates and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  . The balance sheet as of   January 30, 2016  , presented herein, has been derived from the audited balance sheet included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 24, 2016 and referred to herein as the  Annual Report,  but does not include all annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016   and footnotes thereto included in the Annual Report. The consolidated results of operations for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated operating results for the year ending   January 28, 2017   or any other period. The Company's business is seasonal and as a result, the Company's net sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Net sales are usually highest in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season.

(d)      Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The update outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, "Revenue from Contract with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date." ASU 2015-14 deferred the effective date of the ASU to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. In the first six months of fiscal 2016, the FASB issued guidance clarifying the interpretation of certain principles of ASU 2014-09. Companies may use either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the updated guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes." ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, and the Company retrospectively applied the change within the consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the retrospective adoption, the Company reclassified the October 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet resulting in a reduction of   $9.1 million   in current deferred income tax assets and an increase in long term deferred income tax assets of   $9.1 million  . 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases.  ASU 2016-02 requires that lease arrangements longer than 12 months result in an entity recognizing an asset and liability. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the updated guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." ASU No. 2016-09 affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. This accounting standards update makes several modifications to the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the requirement that the excess income tax benefits or deficiencies that arise when the tax consequences of share-based compensation differ from amounts previously recognized in the statement of income be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the statement of income rather than as additional paid-in capital in the balance sheet. The guidance also clarifies the classification of components of share-based awards on the statement of cash flows such that excess income tax benefits should not be presented separately from other income taxes in the statement of cash flows and, thus, should be classified as an operating activity rather than a financing activity as they are under the current guidance. ASU 2016-09 is effective for financial statements issued for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years. Earlier application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the updated guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
   
  (e)      Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property and equipment, valuation allowances for inventories, income taxes and share-based compensation expense. 
   
  (f)      Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified using the following hierarchy, which is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation at the measurement date:  
  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
  Level 2: Inputs, other than Level 1, that are either directly or indirectly observable.  
  Level 3: Unobservable inputs developed using the Company s estimates and assumptions which reflect those that market participants would use.  
  
   8 

The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement.  
  The Company s financial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investment securities, accounts payable, and borrowings, if any, under a line of credit. The Company believes that: (1) the carrying value of cash equivalents and accounts payable are representative of their respective fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments; and (2) the carrying value of the borrowings, if any, under the line of credit approximates fair value because the line of credit s interest rates vary with market interest rates.  Under the fair value hierarchy, the fair market values of the short-term investments in corporate bonds are level 1 while the short-term investments in certificates of deposits and municipals bonds are level 2. The fair market values of level 2 instruments are determined by management with the assistance of a third party pricing service. Since quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, these prices are determined by the third party pricing service using observable market information such as quotes from less active markets and quoted prices of similar securities.  
  As of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016  , and   October 31, 2015  , the Company had cash equivalents of   $35.8 million  ,   $22.6 million   and   $4.6 million  , respectively. The Company s cash equivalents consist of credit and debit card receivables, money market funds, certificates of deposit, and short-term municipal bonds. Fair value for cash equivalents was determined based on Level 1 inputs. 
  As of   October 29, 2016   and   January 30, 2016  , the Company's short-term investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity since the Company has the intent and ability to hold the investments to maturity. Such securities are carried at amortized cost plus accrued interest and consist of the following (in thousands): 

Investment securities as of   October 29, 2016   and   January 30, 2016   all mature in one year or less. 
   
           (2)  
    Income Per Common Share 
     Basic income per common share amounts are calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income per common share amounts are calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and include the dilutive impact of exercise of stock options as well as assumed lapse of restrictions on restricted stock awards and shares currently available for purchase under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, using the treasury stock method. Performance-based restricted stock units are considered contingently issuable shares for diluted income per common share purposes and the dilutive impact, if any, is not included in the weighted-average shares until the performance conditions are met. 
  
   9 

The following table reconciles net income and the weighted average common shares outstanding used in the computations of basic and diluted income per common share (in thousands, except for share and per share data): 

The effects of the assumed exercise of stock options for   61,611   and   196,042   shares of common stock for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016  , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share as their impact would have been anti-dilutive.  
  The effects of the assumed exercise of restricted stock units for   1,376   shares of common stock for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share as their impact would have been anti-dilutive.  
  The effects of the assumed exercise of stock options for   710,383   and   705,943   shares of common stock for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015  , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share as their impact would have been anti-dilutive.  
  The aforementioned excluded shares do not reflect the impact of any incremental repurchases under the treasury stock method.  
   
           (3) 
    Line of Credit 
      
  The Company has a   revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") that allows maximum borrowings of   $20.0 million   with advances tied to a borrowing base and expires on the earliest to occur of (i) May 16, 2017 or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event of default. The Revolving Credit Facility may be increased to   $30.0 million   upon certain conditions. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a   $5.0 million   sub-limit   for the issuance of letters of credit. The borrowing base is   90%   of eligible credit card receivables plus   90%   of the net recovery percentage of eligible inventory less established reserves.    
  The Revolving Credit Facility provides for interest on borrowings, at the Company's option, at (a) a prime rate plus a margin of (i)   0.75%     if excess availability is greater than or equal to   75%  , (ii)   1.0%   if excess availability is less than   75%     but greater than or equal to   33%   or (iii)   1.25%     if excess availability is less than   33%   or (b) a LIBOR-based rate plus a margin of (i)   1.75%   if excess availability is greater than or equal to   75%  , (ii)     2.00%   if excess availability is less than   75%   but greater than or equal to   33%   or (iii)   2.25%   if excess availability is less than   33%  . The Revolving Credit Facility further provides for a letter of credit fee equal to the LIBOR-based rate plus (i)   1.75%   if excess availability is greater than or equal to   75%  , (ii)   2.00%     if excess availability is less than     75%   but greater than or equal to   33%   or (iii)   2.25%   if excess availability is less than   33%  . The Revolving Credit Facility also contains an unused credit facility fee of   0.375%   per annum and is subject to a servicing fee of   approximately   $12.0 thousand   per year.     
  The Revolving Credit Facility includes a covenant which requires the Company to maintain minimum excess collateral availability of no less than the greater of (i)     10%     of the then effective maximum credit and (ii)     $3.0 million  . 
  The Revolving Credit Facility also includes customary negative and affirmative covenants including, among others, limitations on the Company's ability to (i) incur additional debt; (ii) create liens; (iii) make certain investments, loans and advances; (iv) sell assets; (v) pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments; (vi) engage in mergers or consolidations; or (vii) change the Company's business.  
  
   10 

Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to payment upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including those from the sale of certain assets, and is subject to an increase in the interest rate on borrowings and the letter of credit fee of   2.0%   upon an event of default. Amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may become due upon certain events of default including, among others, failure to comply with the Revolving Credit Facility s covenants, bankruptcy, default on certain other indebtedness or a change in control. 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $20.0 million   available on the line of credit of which   $19.6 million   was available and   $0.4 million   was issued on an outstanding letter of credit obligation.  
  All obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets and are guaranteed by the Company's subsidiary. As of   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , the Company was in compliance with the covenants applicable to it under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
   
           (4) 
    Commitments and Contingencies 
      
  Commitments 
  Leases 
  The Company leases property and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain retail store lease agreements provide for contingent rental payments if the store s net sales exceed stated levels (percentage rents) and/or contain escalation clauses, which provide for increases in base rental for increases in future operating costs. Many of the Company s leases provide for one or more renewal options for periods of   five years  . The Company s operating lease agreements, including assumed extensions, which are generally those that take the lease to a   ten  -year term, expire through fiscal 2031.  
  During the   thirteen weeks ended     October 29, 2016  , the Company committed to   26   new store leases with terms of   10   years that have future minimum lease payments of approximately   $52.4 million  . 
  In September 2016, the Company signed a 15-year lease for a new corporate headquarters location in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to accommodate the Company s current and anticipated future growth. The Company expects to initially occupy approximately 110,000 square feet of office space in early 2018 and expects to expand into approximately 20,000 square feet of additional office space by no later than 2023. The lease agreement has future minimum lease payments of approximately $54 million and expires in March 2033 with options to renew for two successive five-year periods.  
  Other contractual commitments 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company has other purchase commitments of approximately   $2.7 million   consisting of purchase agreements for materials that will be used in the construction of new stores.  
   
  Contingencies 
  Legal Matters 
  From time to time, the Company is involved in certain legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In management s opinion, the outcome of such actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.  
   
           (5) 
    Share-Based Compensation 
      
  Equity Incentive Plan 
  Pursuant to the Company's 2002 Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), the Company s board of directors may grant stock options, restricted shares, and restricted stock units to officers, directors, key employees and professional service providers. The Plan, as amended, allows for the issuance of up to a total of   7,600,000   shares under the Plan. As of   October 29, 2016  ,   3,599,083   stock options, restricted shares, or restricted stock units were available for grant. 
   
  Common Stock Options 
  All stock options have a term not greater than   ten   years. Stock options vest and become exercisable in whole or in part, in accordance with vesting conditions set by the compensation committee of the Company s board of directors. Options granted to date generally vest over   four   years from the date of grant.  
  
   11 

Stock option activity under the Plan was as follows: 

The fair value of each option award granted to employees, including outside directors, is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:  

The Company uses the simplified method to estimate the expected term of the option. The expected volatility incorporates historical and implied volatility of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.    
  The per-share weighted average grant-date fair value of stock options granted for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   was   $18.89   and   $13.67  , respectively.  
   
  Restricted Stock Units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units 
  All restricted stock units ("RSU") and performance-based restricted stock units ("PSU") vest in accordance with vesting conditions set by the compensation committee of the Company s board of directors. RSU's granted to date have vesting periods ranging from less than   one   year to   five   years from the date of grant. PSU's granted to date have vesting periods ranging from one year to five years from the date of grant, including grants that have a cumulative three year performance period, subject to satisfaction of the applicable performance goals established for the respective grant.  The Company periodically assesses the probability of achievement of the performance criteria and adjusts the amount of compensation expense accordingly.  Compensation is recognized over the vesting period and adjusted for the probability of achievement of the performance criteria. 
  RSU and PSU activity during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   was as follows: 

12 

In connection with the vesting of RSU's and PSU's during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016  , the Company withheld   44,595   shares with an aggregate value of   $1.8 million   in satisfaction of minimum tax withholding obligations due upon vesting. 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , there was   $22.0 million   of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements (including stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units) granted under the Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average vesting period of   2.4   years.

    Income Taxes 
     The following table summarizes the Company s income tax expense and effective tax rates for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

The effective tax rates for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   were based on the Company s forecasted annualized effective tax rates and were adjusted for discrete items that occurred within the periods presented. The effective tax rate for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   was lower than the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015   as a result of a change in the Company's average state tax rate. 
  The Company had   no   material accrual for uncertain tax positions or interest or penalties related to income taxes on the Company s balance sheets as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016  , or   October 31, 2015   and has not recognized any material uncertain tax positions or interest and/or penalties related to income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   or   October 31, 2015  .  
  The Company files a federal income tax return as well as state tax returns. The Company s U.S. federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended February 1, 2014 and thereafter remain subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ). State returns are filed in various state jurisdictions, as appropriate, with varying statutes of limitation and remain subject to examination for varying periods up to   3   to   4   years depending on the state.

  Overview 
  Five Below is a rapidly growing specialty value retailer offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at the teen and pre-teen customer. We offer a dynamic, edited assortment of exciting products, all priced at $5 and below, including select brands and licensed merchandise across our category worlds. As of   October 29, 2016  , we operated   517   stores in   31   states. 
  In August 2016, we commenced selling merchandise on the internet, through our fivebelow.com e-commerce website. We launched our e-commerce operation as an additional channel to service our customers and increase sales. All e-commerce sales, which includes shipping and handling revenue, will be included in net sales and will be included in comparable sales beginning with the third fiscal quarter of 2016. Our e-commerce expenses will have components classified as both cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses. 
   
  How We Assess the Performance of Our Business 
  In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. These key measures include net sales, comparable sales, cost of goods sold and gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses and operating income. 
  
   15 

Net Sales 
  Net sales constitute gross sales net of merchandise returns for damaged or defective goods. Net sales consist of sales from comparable stores, non-comparable stores, and e-commerce, which includes shipping and handling revenue. Revenue from the sale of gift cards is deferred and not included in net sales until the gift cards are redeemed to purchase merchandise.  
  Our business is seasonal and as a result, our net sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Net sales are usually highest in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season.  
  Comparable Sales 
  Comparable sales include net sales from stores that have been open for at least 15 full months from their opening date,    and e-commerce sales. Comparable stores include the following: 
             
    Stores that have been remodeled while remaining open; 
                
    Stores that have been relocated within the same trade area, to a location that is not significantly different in size, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes; and 
                
    Stores that have expanded, but are not significantly different in size, within their current locations. 
     For stores that are relocated or expanded, the following periods are excluded when calculating comparable sales: 

The period beginning when the closing store receives its last merchandise delivery from one of our distribution centers through:  
                
    the last day of the fiscal year in which the store was relocated or expanded (for stores that increased significantly in size); or 
                
    the last day of the fiscal month in which the store re-opens (for all other stores); and 
                
    The period beginning on the first anniversary of the date the store received its last merchandise delivery from one of our distribution centers through the first anniversary of the date the store re-opened. 
     There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or  same store  sales. As a result, data in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding our comparable sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers. Non-comparable sales are comprised of new store sales, sales for stores not open for a full 15 months, and sales from existing store relocation and expansion projects that were temporarily closed (or not receiving deliveries) and not included in comparable sales. 
  Measuring the change in fiscal year-over-year comparable sales allows us to evaluate how our store base is performing. Various factors affect comparable sales, including: 

consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends; 
                
    our ability to identify and respond effectively to customer preferences and trends; 
                
    our ability to provide an assortment of high-quality, trend-right and everyday product offerings that generate new and repeat visits to our stores; 
                
    the customer experience we provide in our stores; 
                
    the level of traffic near our locations in the power, community and lifestyle centers in which we operate; 
                
    competition; 
                
    changes in our merchandise mix; 
                
    pricing; 
                
    our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; 
                
    the timing of promotional events and holidays; 
                
    the timing of introduction of new merchandise and customer acceptance of new merchandise; 
                
    our opening of new stores in the vicinity of existing stores;  
                
    the number of items purchased per store visit; and 
                
    weather conditions. 
     Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. As we continue to pursue our growth strategy, we expect that a significant percentage of our net sales will continue to come from new stores not included in comparable sales. Accordingly, comparable sales is only one measure we use to assess the success of our growth strategy. 
  
   16 

Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
  Gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of goods sold. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of our net sales. Cost of goods sold reflects the direct costs of purchased merchandise and inbound freight, as well as store occupancy, distribution and buying expenses. Store occupancy costs include rent, common area maintenance, utilities and property taxes for all store locations. Distribution costs include costs for receiving, processing, warehousing and shipping of merchandise to or from our distribution centers and between store locations. Buying costs include compensation expense and other costs for our internal buying organization, including our merchandising and product development team and our planning and allocation group. These costs are significant and can be expected to continue to increase as our company grows. 
  The components of our cost of goods sold may not be comparable to the components of cost of goods sold or similar measures of our competitors and other retailers. As a result, data in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors and other retailers. 
  The variable component of our cost of goods sold is higher in higher volume quarters because the variable component of our cost of goods sold generally increases as net sales increase. We regularly analyze the components of gross profit as well as gross margin. Any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups, a significant increase in our use of markdowns, and a significant increase in inventory shrinkage or inability to generate sufficient sales leverage on the store occupancy, distribution and buying components of cost of goods sold could have an adverse impact on our gross profit and results of operations. Changes in the mix of our products may also impact our overall cost of goods sold. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative, or SG A, expenses are composed of payroll and other compensation, marketing and advertising expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other selling and administrative expenses. SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales are usually higher in lower sales volume quarters and lower in higher sales volume quarters. 
  The components of our SG A expenses may not be comparable to those of other retailers. We expect that our SG A expenses will increase in future periods due to our continuing store growth. In addition, any increase in future share-based grants or modifications will increase our share-based compensation expense included in SG A expenses. 
  Operating Income 
  Operating income equals gross profit less SG A expenses. Operating income excludes interest expense or income, and income tax expense or benefit. We use operating income as an indicator of the productivity of our business and our ability to manage SG A expenses. Operating income percentage measures operating income as a percentage of our net sales.

Results of Consolidated Operations 
  The following tables summarize key components of our results of consolidated operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net sales.   

(1)   
    Components may not add to total due to rounding. 
               (2)   
    Only includes stores open during the full   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended   periods.  
     Thirteen Weeks Ended   October 29, 2016   Compared to the Thirteen Weeks Ended   October 31, 2015    
  Net Sales 
  Net sales   increased   to   $199.5 million   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 29, 2016   from   $169.7 million   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 31, 2015  , an   increase   of   $29.8 million  , or   17.6%  . The   increase   was the result of a non-comparable sales increase of   $30.2 million   offset by a comparable sales   decrease   of   $0.4 million  . The   increase   in non-comparable sales was primarily driven by new stores that opened in fiscal   2016   and the number of stores that opened in fiscal   2015   but have not been open for 15 full months. We plan to open   85   net new stores in fiscal   2016  . 
  Comparable sales   decreased     0.2%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     October 29, 2016   compared to the   thirteen weeks ended     October 31, 2015  . This   decrease   resulted from a   decrease   of approximately   2.1%   in the number of transactions in our stores partially offset by an   increase   of approximately   1.9%   in the average dollar value of transactions. 
  
   18 

Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
  Cost of goods sold   increased   to   $135.5 million   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 29, 2016   from   $116.9 million   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 31, 2015  , an   increase   of   $18.6 million  , or   15.9%  . The   increase   in cost of goods sold was primarily the result of an   increase   in the merchandise cost of goods resulting from the   increase   in net sales. Also contributing to the increase in cost of goods sold were an increase in store occupancy costs resulting from new store openings.  
  Gross profit   increased   to   $64.0 million   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 29, 2016   from   $52.8 million   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 31, 2015  , an   increase   of   $11.2 million  , or   21.3%  . Gross margin   increased   to   32.1%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     October 29, 2016   from   31.1%   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 31, 2015  , an   increase   of approximately   100   basis points. The   increase   in gross margin was primarily the result of decreases as a percentage of sales in merchandise cost of goods sold and distribution costs. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses   increased   to   $55.4 million   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 29, 2016   from   $45.8 million   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 31, 2015  , an   increase   of   $9.6 million  , or   21.0%  . As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses   increased   approximately   80   basis points to   27.8%   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 29, 2016   compared to   27.0%   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 31, 2015  . The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increases of   $6.6 million   in store-related expenses to support new store growth and   $3.0 million   of corporate-related expenses, which includes share-based compensation expense. 
  Income Tax Expense 
  Income tax expense   increased   to   $3.2 million   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 29, 2016   from   $2.7 million   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 31, 2015  , an   increase   of   $0.6 million  , or   21.1%  . The   increase   in income tax expense was primarily the result of a   $1.7 million   increase in pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate for the   thirteen weeks ended     October 29, 2016   was   37.4%   compared to   38.2%   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 31, 2015  . Our effective tax rate for the   thirteen weeks ended     October 29, 2016   was lower than the comparable period as a result of a change in our average state tax rate. 
  Net Income 
  As a result of the foregoing, net income   increased   to   $5.4 million   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 29, 2016   from   $4.3 million   in the   thirteen weeks ended     October 31, 2015  , an   increase   of   $1.1 million   or   25.6%  .  
  Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended     October 29, 2016   Compared to the   Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended     October 31, 2015    
  Net Sales 
  Net sales   increased   to   $612.3 million   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   from   $505.6 million   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015  , an   increase   of   $106.7 million  , or   21.1%  . The   increase   was the result of a non-comparable sales increase of   $94.8 million   and a comparable sales increase of   $11.9 million  . The   increase   in non-comparable sales was primarily driven by new stores that opened in fiscal   2016   and the number of stores that opened in fiscal   2015   but have not been open for 15 full months. We plan to open   85   net new stores in fiscal   2016  . 
  Comparable sales   increased     2.6%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   compared to the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015  . This   increase   resulted from an   increase   of approximately   3.1%   in the average dollar value of transactions partially offset by a   decrease   of approximately   0.5%   in the number of transactions in our stores. 
  Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
  Cost of goods sold   increased   to   $414.7 million   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   from   $345.9 million   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015  , an   increase   of   $68.8 million  , or   19.9%  . The   increase   in cost of goods sold was primarily the result of an   increase   in the merchandise cost of goods resulting from the   increase   in net sales. Also contributing to the increase in cost of goods sold were an increase in store occupancy costs resulting from new store openings and an increase in distribution costs, primarily due to the increase in net sales.  
  Gross profit   increased   to   $197.6 million   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   from   $159.8 million   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015  , an   increase   of   $37.9 million  , or   23.7%  . Gross margin   increased   to   32.3%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   from   31.6%   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015  , an   increase   of approximately   70   basis points. The   increase   in gross margin was primarily the result of decreases as a percentage of sales in merchandise cost of goods sold and distribution costs.

As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were consistent for the comparable period. The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increases of   $19.9 million   in store-related expenses to support new store growth and   $8.4 million   of corporate-related expenses, which includes share-based compensation expense. 
  Income Tax Expense 
  Income tax expense   increased   to   $13.3 million   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   from   $9.6 million   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015  , an   increase   of   $3.7 million  , or   38.3%  . The   increase   in income tax expense was primarily the result of a   $10.0 million   increase in pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   was   37.5%   compared to   37.9%   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015  . Our effective tax rate for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   was lower than the comparable period as a result of a change in our average state tax rate.

  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (defined in  -  Line of Credit   ). Our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures and working capital.  
  Capital expenditures typically vary depending on the timing of new store openings and infrastructure-related investments. We plan to make capital expenditures of approximately   $38 million   in   fiscal 2016  , which we expect to fund from cash generated from operations. We expect to devote approximately   $25 million   of our capital expenditure budget in   fiscal 2016   to construct and open   85   net new stores, with the remainder projected to be spent on store relocations and remodels, our distribution centers, and our corporate infrastructure.  
  Our primary working capital requirements are for the purchase of store inventory and payment of payroll, rent, other store operating costs and distribution costs. Our working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, rising in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as we take title to increasing quantities of inventory in anticipation of our peak, year-end holiday shopping season in the fourth fiscal quarter. Fluctuations in working capital are also driven by the timing of new store openings.  
  Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the fiscal year with cash on hand, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. When we have used our Revolving Credit Facility, the amount of indebtedness outstanding under it has tended to be the highest in the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Over the past three fiscal years, to the extent that we have drawn on the facility, we have paid down the borrowings before the end of the fiscal year with cash generated during our peak selling season in the fourth quarter. We did not have any direct borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016  . As of   October 29, 2016  , we had approximately $20.0 million available on the line of credit of which $19.6 million was available and $0.4 million was issued on an outstanding letter of credit obligation.  
  Based on our growth plans, we believe that our cash position, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to finance our planned capital expenditures, working capital requirements and debt service over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. If cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are not sufficient or available to meet our requirements, then we will be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future. There can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or, if available, that the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then-current shareholders.

Cash Flows 
  A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities is presented in the following table (in millions): 

(1)    Components may not add to total due to rounding. 

Cash Used in Operating Activities 
  Net cash used in operating activities for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   was   $2.9 million  , an increase of   $1.4 million   compared to the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to changes in overall working capital partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows from store performance and a decrease in income taxes paid. 
   
  Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities 
  Net cash provided by investing activities for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   was   $0.7 million  , an   increase   of   $45.5 million   compared to the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in net investment securities and a decrease in capital expenditures. The   decrease   in capital expenditures was primarily due to cash outflows related to our new distribution center in Pedricktown, New Jersey during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015  .  
   
  Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   was   $2.6 million  , an   increase   of   $1.4 million   compared to the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily the result of increases in the proceeds from the exercise of options and excess tax benefits related to exercises of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units offset by an increase in common shares withheld for taxes.   
   
  Line of Credit 
  The Company has a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") that allows maximum borrowings of $20.0 million with advances tied to a borrowing base and expires on the earliest to occur of (i) May 16, 2017 or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event of default. The Revolving Credit Facility may be increased to $30.0 million upon certain conditions. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a $5.0 million sub limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The borrowing base is 90% of eligible credit card receivables plus 90% of the net recovery percentage of eligible inventory less established reserves. 
  The Revolving Credit Facility provides for interest on borrowings, at our option, at (a) a prime rate plus a margin of (i)   0.75%     if excess availability is greater than or equal to   75%  , (ii)   1.0%   if excess availability is less than   75%     but greater than or equal to   33%   or (iii)   1.25%     if excess availability is less than   33%   or (b) a LIBOR-based rate plus a margin of (i)   1.75%   if excess availability is greater than or equal to   75%  , (ii)     2.00%   if excess availability is less than   75%   but greater than or equal to   33%   or (iii)   2.25%   if excess availability is less than   33%  . The Revolving Credit Facility further provides for a letter of credit fee equal to the LIBOR-based rate plus (i)   1.75%   if excess availability is greater than or equal to   75%  , (ii)   2.00%   if excess availability is less than 75% but greater than or equal to   33%   or (iii)   2.25%   if excess availability is less than   33%  . The Revolving Credit Facility also contains an unused credit facility fee of   0.375%   per annum and is subject to a servicing fee of   approximately $12.0 thousand   per year.  
  The Revolving Credit Facility includes a covenant which requires us to maintain minimum excess collateral availability of no less than the greater of (i)   10%     of the then effective maximum credit and (ii)     $3.0 million  . 
  The Revolving Credit Facility also includes customary negative and affirmative covenants including, among others, limitations on our ability to (i) incur additional debt; (ii) create liens; (iii) make certain investments, loans and advances; (iv) sell assets; (v) pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments; (vi) engage in mergers or consolidations; or (vii) change our business.  
  
   21 

Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to payment upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including those from the sale of certain assets, and is subject to an increase in the interest rate on borrowings and the letter of credit fee of   2.0%   upon an event of default. Amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may become due upon certain events of default including, among others, failure to comply with the Revolving Credit Facility s covenants, bankruptcy, default on certain other indebtedness or a change in control. 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had approximately $20.0 million available on the line of credit of which $19.6 million was available and $0.4 million was issued on an outstanding letter of credit obligation.  
  All obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and are guaranteed by the Company's subsidiary. As of   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to us under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the Annual Report. We believe that there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016  . 
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as disclosed in the Annual Report, other than those which occur in the ordinary course of business. 
  From   January 30, 2016   to   October 29, 2016  , we have entered into   77   new fully executed retail leases with an average term of 10 years and other lease modifications that have future minimum lease payments of approximately   $146.6 million  .  
  In September 2016, we signed a 15-year lease for a new corporate headquarters location in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to accommodate our current and anticipated future growth. We expect to initially occupy approximately 110,000 square feet of office space in early 2018 and expect to expand into approximately 20,000 square feet of additional office space by no later than 2023. The lease agreement has future minimum lease payments of approximately $54 million and expires in March 2033 with options to renew for two successive five-year periods.  
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  For the quarterly period ended     October 29, 2016  , except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, net sales, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The update outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, "Revenue from Contract with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date." ASU 2015-14 deferred the effective date of the ASU to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. In the first six months of fiscal 2016, the FASB issued guidance clarifying the interpretation of certain principles of ASU 2014-09. We may use either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU. We are currently evaluating the impact of the updated guidance on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes." ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt this guidance effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, and we retrospectively applied the change within our consolidated balance sheets.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases.  ASU 2016-02 requires that lease arrangements longer than 12 months result in an entity recognizing an asset and liability. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the updated guidance on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." ASU No. 2016-09 affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. This accounting standards update makes several modifications to the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the requirement that the excess income tax benefits or deficiencies that arise when the tax consequences of share-based compensation differ from amounts previously recognized in the statement of income be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the statement of income rather than as additional paid-in capital in the balance sheet. The guidance also clarifies the classification of components of share-based awards on the statement of cash flows such that excess income tax benefits should not be presented separately from other income taxes in the statement of cash flows and, thus, should be classified as an operating activity rather than a financing activity as they are under the current guidance. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for financial statements issued for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years. Earlier application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the updated guidance on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Our principal market risk relates to interest rate sensitivity, which is the risk that future changes in interest rates will reduce our net income or net assets. We have short-term investment securities that are interest-bearing securities and if there are changes in interest rates, those changes would affect the interest income we earn on these investments and, therefore, impact our cash flows and results of operations. However, due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe an immediate 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio, and accordingly we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates. 
  We also have a Revolving Credit Facility which includes a revolving line of credit with advances tied to a borrowing base, which bears interest at a variable rate. Because our Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates.  
  As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $20.0 million   available on the line of credit of which $19.6 million was available and $0.4 million was issued on an outstanding letter of credit obligation. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for interest on borrowings, at the Company's option, at (a) a prime rate plus a margin of (i)   0.75%     if excess availability is greater than or equal to   75%  , (ii)   1.0%   if excess availability is less than   75%     but greater than or equal to   33%   or (iii)   1.25%     if excess availability is less than   33%   or (b) a LIBOR-based rate plus a margin of (i)   1.75%   if excess availability is greater than or equal to   75%  , (ii)     2.00%   if excess availability is less than   75%   but greater than or equal to   33%   or (iii)   2.25%   if excess availability is less than   33%  . The Revolving Credit Facility further provides for a letter of credit fee equal to the LIBOR-based rate plus (i)   1.75%   if excess availability is greater than or equal to   75%  , (ii)   2.00%   if excess availability is less than 75% but  
  
   23 

greater than or equal to   33%   or (iii)   2.25%   if excess availability is less than   33%  . We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes, but this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future.  
  Impact of Inflation 
  Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our historical results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial. We cannot assure you, however, that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. While our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the   thirteen weeks ended     October 29, 2016   that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

24 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, and employment actions, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of actions brought against us. Accordingly, adverse developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and negatively impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement or resolution. If a potential loss arising from these lawsuits, claims and pending actions is probable and reasonably estimable, we record the estimated liability based on circumstances and assumptions existing at the time. Although the outcome of these and other claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  

25 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
  Risk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors  in our Annual Report and in Part II, Item 1A  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 30, 2016 ( 2   nd    Quarter 10-Q ). There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report and 2   nd    Quarter 10-Q. You should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual Report and 2   nd    Quarter 10-Q, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report and 2   nd    Quarter 10-Q are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected.
