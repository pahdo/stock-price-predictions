Notes to Financial Statements

September 30, 2016

Note 1   Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

Nature of Business and Organization 

VW Win Century, Inc. ("VW Win Century" or the "Company"), an Illinois corporation, was formed on March 3, 2013 as Cooling Technology Solutions, Inc. ("CTS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Epazz, Inc. ("Epazz"), an Illinois corporation. On September 19, 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change the name from Cooling Technology Solutions, Inc. to Z Fridge, Inc. and was renamed Flexfridge, Inc. on May 29, 2014 and further renamed on September 12, 2016 to VW Win Century, Inc.

On September 7, 2013, the sole Director, and majority shareholder, holding over two thirds of the voting power of the Corporation's Class A and Class B Common Stock of Epazz, voted to approve the spin-off and stock dividend of Z Fridge, whereby each of Epazz' shareholders of record on September 15, 2013 received 1 share of Z Fridge for each 10 shares of Epazz Class A Common Stock as distributed on November 21, 2013.

On or about August 26, 2016, Shaun Passley, our former officer and director sold an aggregate of Two Hundred Sixty Two Million Nine Hundred Nine Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Five (262,909,255) shares of the Class A Common Stock of the Company (or 525,819 shares on a post-reverse split basis) to Teik Keng Goh in a private transaction.   As a result of the purchase, Teik Keng Goh became the majority shareholder of our Company and beneficially owned stock representing 75.45% of the issued and outstanding Class A Common Shares. In addition, Mr. Passley also sold Sixty Million (60,000,000) shares of Class B Common Stock and Twenty Million (20,000,000) shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Teik Keng Goh, representing all of the issued and outstanding shares of those series and classes.

Effective as of August 31, 2016, our board of directors appointed Teik Keng Goh and See Kuy Tan to fill vacancies on the board with Teik Keng Goh serving as Chairman.  The board of directors appointed See Kuy Tan as President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer and Kathleen Mary Johnston as Secretary of the Company.  The forgoing individuals will serve in their respective positions until their earlier resignation or removal.

Basis of Accounting 

Our financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting as generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained therein.

Reclassifications 

Certain amounts in the financial statements of the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current year for comparative purposes.

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

VW Win Century maintains cash balances in non-interest-bearing transaction accounts, which do not currently exceed federally insured limits. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents on hand at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Under FASB ASC 820-10-05, the Financial Accounting Standards Board establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement reaffirms that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements as reflected herein. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses reported on the balance sheets are estimated by management to approximate fair value primarily due to the short term nature of the instruments.

Notes to Financial Statements

Patent Rights and Applications 

VW Win Century acquired a patent on the technology on December 22, 2015. The patent number is US 9,217,598 B2. On December 29, 2015, Epazz transferred ownership of this patent to VW Win Century for a promissory note of $250,000 for 10 years with a 15% interest rate. Since the transfer of the patent was a related party transaction the value of patent included in the balance sheet is at its historical cost of zero. As the fair value of the promissory note exceeded the value of the patent, the difference of $250,000 was recorded as a loss on patent acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Patent rights and applications costs include the acquisition costs and costs incurred for the filing of patents. Patent rights and applications are amortized on a straight-line basis over the legal life of the patent rights beginning at the time the patents are approved. Patent costs for unsuccessful patent applications are expensed when the application is terminated. We elected to expense our patent costs, which totaled $277,641 for the period from March 4, 2013 (Inception) through September 30, 2016.

Income Taxes 

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.

Basic and Diluted Loss per Share 

The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an "as if converted" basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the period presented, there were no outstanding potential common stock equivalents and therefore basic and diluted earnings per share result in the same figure.

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company adopted FASB guidance on stock based compensation upon inception on March 3, 2013. Under FASB ASC 718-10-30-2, all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. In January 2015, the Company issued 20,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for $70,654, 20,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for $12,076 and 60,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock for $5,827 for services rendered.

Uncertain Tax Positions 

Effective upon inception on March 3, 2013, the Company adopted new standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. These standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These standards also provide guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.

Various taxing authorities periodically audit the Company's income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding the Company's tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, the Company records allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which an allowance has been established, is audited and fully resolved. The Company has not yet undergone an examination by any taxing authorities.

The assessment of the Company's tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with the Company's various filing positions. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no uncertain tax positions.

Note 2   Going Concern

As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations resulting in an accumulated deficit of $401,509, as of September 30, 2016. The Company's current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $312,952. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements also do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Note 3   Related Parties

Note Payable 

On December 31, 2015, the Company incurred a $250,000 note payable to Epazz, Inc., a company controlled by a related party Shaun Passley, for a patent licensing agreement. Interest expense is incurred at a 15% annual rate on principal.  Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $28,125.

Accounts Payable 

The Company occasionally borrowed fund from Epazz, Inc. to fund operating activities. These borrowings of $34,827 and $34,856 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively are reflected in Accounts payable. Accrued interest of $28,125 at September 30, 2016 associated with the aforementioned $250,000 note payable to Epazz, Inc. is included in Interest payable.

Each shareholder of record on September 15, 2013 was issued one share of VW Win Century, Inc. Class A common stock for each share of Epazz, Inc. class A common stock owned by the shareholder. A total of 297,385,702 of these shares were issued to related parties representing approximately 86% of the total shares issued.

On or about August 26, 2016, Shaun Passley, our former officer and director sold an aggregate of Two Hundred Sixty Two Million Nine Hundred Nine Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Five (262,909,255) shares of the Class A Common Stock of the Company (or Five Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Eight Hundred Nineteen Thousand (525,819) shares on a post-reverse split basis) to Teik Keng Goh in a private transaction.   As a result of the purchase, Teik Keng Goh became the majority shareholder of our Company and beneficially owned stock representing 75.45% of the issued and outstanding Class A Common Shares. In addition, Mr. Passley also sold Sixty Million (60,000,000) shares of Class B Common Stock and Twenty Million (20,000,000) shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Teik Keng Goh, representing all of the issued and outstanding shares of those series and classes.

Note 4   Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Under FASB ASC 820-10-5, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Under GAAP, certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value, and FASB ASC 820-10-50 details the disclosures that are required for items measured at fair value.

The Company does not have any financial instruments that must be measured under the new fair value standard. The Company's financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows:

Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Notes to Financial Statements

September 30, 2016

The following schedule summarizes the valuation of financial instruments at fair value on a non-recurring basis in the balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively:

There were no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for the period from December 31, 2015 through September 30, 2016.

Level 2 liabilities consist of intercompany debt arrangements. No fair value adjustment was necessary during the period from December 31, 2015 through September 30, 2016.

Note 5   Stockholder's Equity (Deficit)

On November 14, 2013, the Board of Directors, consisting solely of the Company's majority shareholder at the time, amended the Article of Incorporation to change the par value and number of authorized shares of each class of common and series of preferred stock, in addition to the modification of the attributes and dividends. The disclosures herein reflect these modifications and the changes to the par value have been retroactively reflected throughout.

The Amendment was approved by the holders of the Company's capital stock as follows: Class A Common Stock with 262,909,255 votes or 76% approving, Class B Common Stock 120,000,000,000 votes or 100% approving, Series A Convertible Preferred Stock 20,000,000 votes or 100% approving and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock 20,000,000 votes or 100% approving. At the effective of August 11, 2016, each five hundred shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding was combined into a single share of Class A Common Stock with any resulting fractional shares rounded up to the next whole share and with odd lots being rounded up to 100 shares. The Company issued 10,270 shares associated with odd lots being rounded up to 100 shares. The total number of shares of Common Stock authorized and the par value under VW Win Century's Amended Articles of Incorporation was not affected.

Notes to Financial Statements

September 30, 2016

The shareholders and Board of Directors determined that the aforementioned reverse stock split would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders because it will provide the Company with an opportunity to "up list" its Class A Common Stock from a "fully reporting pink" status to "fully reporting QB" status in its primary market with OTC Markets.

On or about August 26, 2016, Shaun Passley, our former officer and director sold an aggregate of Two Hundred Sixty Two Million Nine Hundred Nine Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Five (262,909,255) shares of the Class A Common Stock of the Company (or 525,819 shares on a post-reverse split basis) to Teik Keng Goh in a private transaction.

Note 6   Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740-10, which requires use of the liability method. FASB ASC 740-10-25 provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, referred to as temporary differences.

For the period from March 3, 2013 (Inception) through September 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net operating loss and, accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been recorded. In addition, no benefit for income taxes has been recorded due to the uncertainty of the realization of any tax assets. At September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $62,905 of federal net operating losses. The net operating loss carry forwards, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2034.

The components of the Company's deferred tax asset are as follows:

Based on the available objective evidence, including the Company's history of losses, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company provided for a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2016.

A reconciliation between the amounts of income tax benefit determined by applying the applicable U.S. and State statutory income tax rate to pre-tax loss is as follows:

In accordance with FASB ASC 740, the Company has evaluated its tax positions and determined there are no uncertain tax positions.

Note 7   Subsequent Events

On October 5, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Teik Keng Goh, the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors, for the purchase of a total of 99,000,000 restricted shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock for a total purchase price of $10,000, which is a cost per share of $0.000101.

AS USED HEREIN, THE "COMPANY," "FLEXFRIDGE," "WE," "US," "OUR" AND WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING REFER TO FLEXFRIDGE, INC., UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, OR THE CONTEXT SUGGESTS OTHERWISE.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

VW Win Century, Inc., an Illinois corporation, was formerly known as " FlexFridge , Inc." (the "Company", "us" or "we"). The Company developed  a patented foldable mini-fridge  referred to as "FlexFridge".  FlexFridge was designed to allow students, campers, hotels and businesses to have a big mini-fridge in their dorm rooms, RVs, hotel rooms, or offices. FlexFridge is easy to transport and is easy to setup.

The Company contacted several mini fridge manufacturers in order to help bring the product to market. In our initial contacts, we received interest from four manufacturers. We  have held  discussions with two of the four on how to best partner to bring the product to market. The second option is to manufacture the product ourselves. The Company hired an assistant to contact offshore manufacturers. The company has been working with an engineering service company to source the parts in order to manufacture the product. Based on their estimates, the product can be manufactured in a few months. The engineering service company has already conducted tests on the product. The company has been in contact with UL (Underwriters Laboratories), which is a certification body for consumer products. We are currently exploring the requirements to be UL (Underwriters Laboratories) certified.

The Company has contacted a several hotels to get initial feedback. Based on the information from the engineering service company, we can have the fridges available to the hotels and businesses by the summer of 2016. Our business model for hotels is for them to enter into a revenue sharing agreement in order to share in the rental fees for mini-fridges. The Company will maintain ownership of the mini-fridges at each business location. The commercial version will have a tracking system to keep track of the rental.

Product Development

The concept of   FlexFridge was conceived on March 2011. The concept was that people needed a better way to transport mini-fridges. Dr. Passley believed that a flexible refrigerator would allow people to transport the mini-fridges much easier than before. Dr. Passley filed a provisional patent in August 2011. Below is the summary of the invention.

- 14 - 

The flexible refrigerator may be folded up and stored when not in use and may be inflated with air in a useable second position. The flexible refrigerator may have an interior for storing beverages and/or food while in the useable position. A separating wall within the interior of the device may allow the user to obtain two different temperature zones. A plurality of holes on the exterior surface of the device may allow the flow of air from the exterior of the refrigerator to the interior of the device.

Advantages of the present device includes providing a flexible refrigerator which is easy to transport, easy to store and environmentally friendly. Other advantages of the present device includes, providing a flexible refrigerator which can be molded to fit the contents for which the device stores as well as multiple compartments and different temperature zones.

The initial prototype was a bag at the end of a cooling device in order to store the food when it was expanded and collapse the bag when it was empty. The problem with the initial prototype, was it used a zip in order to close the bag. The initial prototype was functional, however, it was not cold enough to store milk products. Dr. Passley hired an industrial designer in order to design a better FlexFridge in September 2011. The design was completed in October 2011. Dr. Passley then hired an engineering firm in order to develop the FlexFridge. Dr. Passley filed the provisional patent for the new design in February 2013.  In March 2013, FlexFridge, Inc. previously known as Cooling Technology Solutions, Inc. as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Epazz, Inc. Epazz, Inc. filed a non-provisional patent on FlexFridge in February 26, 2014.  This filing made FlexFridge a patent technology with a serial number of 14/190683. FlexFridge has identified a manufacturing partner to produce the fridges. The company expects to sign the manufacturing agreement in the fourth quarter of 2016. The company expects to be producing the product in the fourth quarter of 2016 and first quarter of 2017. FlexFridge is currently seeking a partner to focus on market development in the consumer and industrial markets.

Business Model

The Company will solicit businesses and colleges to enter into a revenue sharing agreement in order to share in the rental fees for mini-fridges guests or students during their visit. The Company will maintain ownership of the mini-fridges at each business location. The commercial version of FlexFridge will be more durable than the consumer version. The commercial version will have a tracking system to keep track of the rental.

The consumer version will be sold outright or will be leased through the Company's website. The Company believes that many users of the fridge would only need the fridge for a short period of time, a few days or a whole school year which is about 9 months. The consumer will rent the fridge through the Company's website, providing a deposit for the fridge. The company will then ship the fridge to the consumer and at the end of the rental period, the consumer will send the fridge back. The Company will then refund the deposit minus the rental fee. The Company has already received some interest from the public.

PLAN OF OPERATION

During the next 12 months, we plan to develop our Project Flex product, which consists of a patent foldable mini-fridge that has yet to be developed, and continue to pursue growth through additional acquisitions. We believe we can satisfy our cash requirements for the next three months with our current cash on hand and revenues generated from our operations. As such, continuing operations and completion of our plan of operation are contingent on finding additional sources of capital. We cannot assure investors that adequate revenues will be generated. In the absence of our projected revenues, we may be unable to proceed with our plan of operations. Even without significant revenues or additional funding within the next several months, we still anticipate being able to continue with our present activities, but we may require financing to potentially achieve our goals of growing our operations and increasing our revenues.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (  229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a "smaller reporting company," as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a   15(c) and 15d   15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls 

Our Principal Executive Officer does not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, other than those stated above, during our most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We are not currently involved in legal proceedings that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. We may become involved in material legal proceedings in the future.
