EXPLANATORY NOTE    
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, 2016 of Life Storage, Inc., formerly known as Sovran
Self Storage, Inc. (the  Parent Company ) and Life Storage LP, formerly known as Sovran Acquisition Limited Partnership (the  Operating Partnership ). The Parent Company is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns its
assets and conducts its operations through the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, and subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. Effective August 15, 2016, the Parent Company changed its name from  Sovran Self
Storage, Inc.  to  Life Storage, Inc.  and the Operating Partnership changed its name from  Sovran Acquisition Limited Partnership  to  Life Storage LP . The Parent Company, the Operating Partnership and their
consolidated subsidiaries are collectively referred to in this report as the  Company.  In addition, terms such as  we,   us,  or  our  used in this report may refer to the Company, the Parent Company and/or
the Operating Partnership.    Life Storage Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Company ( Holdings ), is the sole general
partner of the Operating Partnership; the Parent Company is a limited partner of the Operating Partnership, and through its ownership of Holdings and its limited partnership interest, controls the operations of the Operating Partnership, holding a
99.6% ownership interest therein as of September 30, 2016. The remaining ownership interests in the Operating Partnership are held by certain former owners of assets acquired by the Operating Partnership. As the owner of the sole general
partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has full and complete authority over the Operating Partnership s day-to-day operations and management.  
 Management operates the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. The management teams of the Parent Company and the Operating
Partnership are identical.    There are few differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, which are reflected in the note
disclosures in this report. The Company believes it is important to understand the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how these entities operate as a consolidated enterprise. The Parent Company is
a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of the partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. As a result, the Parent Company does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the owner of the sole general partner of the
Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing the debt obligations of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all the assets of the Company and, directly or indirectly, holds the
ownership interests in the Company s real estate ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the Company s business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity
issuances by the Parent Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company s business through the Operating Partnership s
operations, by the Operating Partnership s direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of partnership units of the Operating Partnership.  
 The substantive difference between the Parent Company s and the Operating Partnership s filings is the fact that the Parent Company is a REIT with
public equity, while the Operating Partnership is a partnership with no publicly traded equity. In the financial statements, this difference is primarily reflected in the equity (or capital for the Operating Partnership) section of the consolidated
balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of equity (or capital). Apart from the different equity treatment, the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are nearly identical.  
      2  

The Company believes that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent Company and the
Operating Partnership into a single report will:      

facilitate a better understanding by the investors of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;

remove duplicative disclosures and provide a more straightforward presentation in light of the fact that a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership; and

create time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.    
 In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in this report for the Parent Company
and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership. In the sections that combine disclosures of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to such disclosures as those of
the Company. Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and real estate ventures and holds assets and debt, reference to the Company is appropriate because the business is one
enterprise and the Parent Company operates the business through the Operating Partnership.    As the owner of the general partner with control of the
Operating Partnership, the Parent Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets
and liabilities of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. The separate discussions of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with
each other to understand the results of the Company s operations on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company.    This report also
includes separate Item 4 Controls and Procedures sections, signature pages and Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Parent Company and the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Operating Partnership have made the requisite certifications and that the Parent Company and the Operating
Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and 18 U.S.C.  1350.

1.  
  BASIS OF PRESENTATION       The accompanying unaudited financial statements of Life Storage, Inc.,
formerly known as Sovran Self Storage, Inc., (the  Parent Company ) and Life Storage LP, formerly known as Sovran Acquisition Limited Partnership, (the  Operating Partnership ) have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnotes required by generally accepted
accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine month
period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  
   Reclassification:   Certain amounts from the 2015 financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation as
described in Note 5.      

2.  
  ORGANIZATION       Effective August 15, 2016, the Parent Company changed its name from  Sovran Self
Storage, Inc.  to  Life Storage, Inc.  and the Operating Partnership changed its name from  Sovran Acquisition Limited Partnership  to  Life Storage LP . Also, consistent with these name changes, and in connection
with the rebranding of our storage facilities from  Uncle Bob s Self Storage      to  Life Storage     , the name
of the general partner of the Operating Partnership has been changed from  Sovran Holdings, Inc.  to  Life Storage Holdings, Inc.  and the name of the Parent Company s taxable REIT subsidiary changed from  Uncle
Bob s Management, LLC  to  Life Storage Solutions, LLC .    The Parent Company operates as a self-administered and self-managed real
estate investment trust (a  REIT ) that owns and operates self-storage facilities throughout the United States. All of the Parent Company s assets are owned by, and all its operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership.
Life Storage Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Company ( Holdings ), is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership; the Parent Company is a limited partner of the Operating Partnership, and through its
ownership of Holdings and its limited partnership interest controls the operations of the Operating Partnership, holding a 99.6% ownership interest therein as of September 30, 2016. The remaining ownership interests in the Operating Partnership
(the  Units ) are held by certain former owners of assets acquired by the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company, the Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries are collectively referred to in this report as the
 Company.  In addition, terms such as  we,   us,  or  our  used in this report may refer to the Company, the Parent Company and/or the Operating Partnership.  
      12  

At September 30, 2016, we had an ownership interest in, and/or managed 657 self-storage properties in 29
states under the names Uncle Bob s Self Storage     and Life Storage    . Among our 657 self-storage properties are 39 properties that
we manage for an unconsolidated joint venture (Sovran HHF Storage Holdings LLC) of which we are a 20% owner, 30 properties that we manage for an unconsolidated joint venture (Sovran HHF Storage Holdings II LLC) of which we are a 15% owner, and 26
properties that we manage and have no ownership interest. Approximately 39.0% of the Company s revenue is derived from stores in the states of Texas and Florida. In addition, approximately 9.9% of the Company s revenue is derived from the
Houston, Texas market.    We consolidate all wholly-owned subsidiaries. Partially owned subsidiaries and joint ventures are consolidated when we control the
entity. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, Life Storage Solutions, LLC (the Parent Company s taxable REIT subsidiary), Warehouse Anywhere LLC (an entity owned 60% by
Life Storage Solutions, LLC), and all other wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Investments in joint ventures that we do not control but for which we have significant influence over are
accounted for using the equity method.    Included in the Parent Company s consolidated balance sheets are noncontrolling redeemable operating
partnership units and included in the Operating Partnership s consolidated balance sheets are limited partners  redeemable capital interest at redemption value. These interests are presented in the  mezzanine  section of the
consolidated balance sheet because they do not meet the functional definition of a liability or equity under current accounting literature. These represent the outside ownership interests of the limited partners in the Operating Partnership. At
September 30, 2016, there were 196,008 noncontrolling redeemable operating partnership Units outstanding (168,866 at December 31, 2015). These unitholders are entitled to receive distributions per unit equivalent to the dividends declared
per share on the Parent Company s common stock. The Operating Partnership is obligated to redeem each of these limited partnership Units in the Operating Partnership at the request of the holder thereof for cash equal to the fair market value
of a share of the Parent Company s common stock, at the time of such redemption, provided that the Company at its option may elect to acquire any such Unit presented for redemption for one common share or cash. The Company accounts for these
noncontrolling redeemable Operating Partnership Units under the provisions of EITF D-98,   Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities   which was codified in FASB ASC Topic 480-10-S99. The application of the FASB ASC
Topic 480-10-S99 accounting model requires the noncontrolling interest to follow normal noncontrolling interest accounting and then be marked to redemption value at the end of each reporting period if higher (but never adjusted below that normal
noncontrolling interest accounting amount). The offset to the adjustment to the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests is reflected in the Company s dividends in excess of net income and in the Operating Partnership s general
partner and limited partners capital balances. Accordingly, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, noncontrolling interests are reflected at redemption value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, equal to the number of
noncontrolling interest units outstanding multiplied by the fair market value of the Parent Company s common stock at that date. Redemption value exceeded the value determined under the Company s historical basis of accounting at those
dates.

In 2016 the Operating Partnership issued 69,005 Units with a fair market value of $7.8 million to acquire self-storage
properties. The fair value of the Units on the date of issuance was determined based upon the fair market value of the Parent Company s common stock on that date.      

3.  
  STOCK BASED COMPENSATION       The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC
Topic 718,   Compensation Stock Compensation  . The Company recognizes compensation cost in its financial statements for all share based payments granted, modified, or settled during the period. For awards with graded vesting,
compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the related vesting period.    For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
the Company recorded compensation expense (included in general and administrative expense) of $4,000 and $46,000, respectively, related to stock options and $1,758,000 and $1,552,000, respectively, related to amortization of non-vested stock grants
and performance-based awards. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded compensation expense of $85,000 and $163,000, respectively, related to stock options and $5,515,000 and $4,743,000, respectively, related
to amortization of non-vested stock grants and performance-based awards.  
      14  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, employees and directors exercised 0 and 1,900
stock options respectively, and 29,205 and 31,078 shares of non-vested stock, respectively, vested. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, employees and directors exercised 0 and 16,900 stock options respectively, and 40,086
and 42,307 shares of non-vested stock, respectively, vested.      

4.  
  INVESTMENT IN STORAGE FACILITIES AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS       The following summarizes our activity in storage
facilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.      
   On July 15, 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding partnership interests in LifeStorage, LP, a Delaware
limited partnership ( LS ). Pursuant to the acquisition, the Company acquired 83 self-storage properties throughout the country, including the following markets: Chicago, Illinois; Las Vegas, Nevada; Sacramento, California; Austin, Texas;
and Los Angeles, California. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 18, 2016 by and among LS, the Operating Partnership, Solar Lunar Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Operating Partnership, and Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as Sellers  Representative, the Company paid aggregate consideration of approximately $1.3 billion, of which $482 million was paid to discharge
existing indebtedness of LS (including prepayment penalties and defeasance costs totaling $15.5 million). The merger was funded with the existing cash that was generated primarily from the proceeds from the Company s May 2016 common stock
offering and the 2026 Senior Notes offering, and draws on the Company s line of credit totaling $482 million.  
      15  

Including the LS acquisition, the Company acquired 120 facilities during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. The acquisition of two stores that were acquired at certificate of occupancy were accounted for as asset acquisitions. The cost of these stores, including closing costs, was assigned to land, building, equipment and
improvements components based upon their relative fair values. The assets and liabilities of the other 118 storage facilities acquired in 2016, which primarily consist of tangible and intangible assets, are measured at fair value on the date of
acquisition in accordance with the principles of FASB ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   and were accounted for as business combinations in accordance with the   principles of FASB ASC Topic 805
 Business Combinations.  The purchase price of the 120 facilities acquired in 2016 has been preliminarily assigned as follows:        
   All of the properties acquired were purchased from unrelated third parties. The operating results of the facilities acquired
have been included in the Company s operations since the respective acquisition dates. The $1,783.0 million of cash paid for the properties acquired during 2016 includes payment for cash acquired of $40.8 million and $4.0 million of deposits
that were paid in 2015 when certain of these properties originally went under contract. Both of these amounts are excluded from total cash payments for the acquisition of storage facilities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.  
 Non-cash investing activities during 2016 include the issuance of $7.8 million in Operating Partnership Units, the assumption of two mortgages with
outstanding balances of $8.3 million, and the assumption of net other liabilities of $7.3 million.    The Company measures the fair value of in-place
customer lease intangible assets based on the Company s experience with customer turnover and the cost to replace the in-place leases. The Company amortizes in-place customer leases on a straight-line basis over 12 months (the estimated future
benefit period). The Company measures the value of trade names, which have an indefinite life and are not amortized, by calculating discounted cash flows utilizing the relief from royalty method.  
      16  

In-place customer leases are included in other assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheets as
follows:      
   Amortization expense related to in-place customer leases was $13.5 million and $0.7 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and was $16.5 million and $2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company expects to record $29.9 million and $24.7 million of amortization expense for
the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company acquired 120 properties.
The following pro forma information is based on the combined historical financial statements of the Company and the 120 properties acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as if the acquisitions had all occurred as of
January 1, 2015.      
   The above pro forma information includes the results of eight stores acquired by LS in 2016 and 17 stores acquired by LS in in
2015. These stores therefore were not owned by LS for the entire pro forma periods and results prior to LS ownership are not included in the above pro forma information. The above pro forma information also includes increases in amortization of
in-place customer leases totaling $13.3 million and $39.9 million for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2015, respectively. As noted above, in-place customer leases are amortized over their estimated future benefit period of
12 months. Material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combinations and included in the above pro forma financial information include reductions to interest expense related to acquisition bridge financing
totaling $7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and reductions to acquisition costs totaling $25.2 million and $29.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  
 The following table summarizes the revenues and earnings since the acquisition dates that are included in the Company s consolidated statements of
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the 120 properties acquired during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
      17  

The above net losses attributable to common shareholders were primarily due to amortization of in-place customer leases
acquired and the acquisition costs incurred in connection with the 2016 acquisitions.      Property Dispositions    
 During 2016 the Company sold eight non-strategic properties with a carrying value of $18.8 million and received cash proceeds of $34.1 million, resulting in a
$15.3 million gain on sale. During 2015 the Company sold three non-strategic properties purchased in 2014 and 2015 with a carrying value of $5.1 million and received cash proceeds of $4.6 million, resulting in a $0.5 million loss on sale. The
following table summarizes the revenues and expenses up to the dates of sale of the 11 properties sold in 2016 and 2015 that are included in the Company s consolidated statements of operations for 2016 and 2015.  
   
     Change in Signage Useful Life Estimates    
 The change in name of the Company s storage facilities from Uncle Bob s Self Storage     to
Life Storage     as discussed in Note 2 will require replacement of signage at all existing storage facilities which are currently included in investment in storage facilities, net on the
consolidated balance sheets. The replacement of this signage is being completed at various times based on market and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017. The Company has reassessed the estimated useful lives of the existing signage
which resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $4 million in the third quarter of 2016 as depreciation was accelerated over the new useful lives. The Company estimates that this change will result in additional increases in
depreciation expense of approximately $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and approximately $1 million in 2017 as a result of the replacement of this existing Uncle Bob s Self Storage
    signage.    The accelerated depreciation reduced basic earnings per share/unit by approximately
$0.10 and $0.11 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and reduced diluted earnings per share/unit by approximately $0.10 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

5.  
  UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT AND TERM NOTES       Borrowings outstanding on our unsecured line of credit and term
notes are as follows:      
   In January 2016, the Company exercised the expansion feature on its existing amended unsecured credit agreement and increased
the revolving credit limit from $300 million to $500 million. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable annual rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on the Company s credit rating (at September 30,
2016 the margin is 1.10%), and requires an annual 0.15% facility fee. The amended agreement also reduced the interest rate on the $325 million unsecured term note issued under this credit agreement maturing June 4, 2020, with the term note
bearing interest at LIBOR plus a margin based on the Company s credit rating (at September 30, 2016 the margin is 1.15%). The interest rate at September 30, 2016 on the Company s line of credit was approximately 1.62% (1.72% at
December 31, 2015). At September 30, 2016, there was $260 million available on the unsecured line of credit. The revolving line of credit has a maturity date of December 10, 2019.  
 On July 21, 2016, the Company entered into a $200 million term note maturing July 21, 2028 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 3.67%. The proceeds
from this term note were used to repay a portion of the then outstanding balance on the Company s line of credit.    On April 8, 2014, the Company
entered into a $175 million term note maturing April 8, 2024 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 4.533%. The interest rate on the term note increases to 6.283% if the Company is not rated by at least one rating agency or if the Company s
credit rating is downgraded. The proceeds from this term note were used to repay the $115 million outstanding on the Company s line of credit at April 8, 2014, with the excess proceeds used for acquisitions.  
 In 2011, the Company entered into a $100 million term note maturing August 5, 2021 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.54%. The interest rate on
the term note increases to 7.29% if the notes are not rated by at least one rating agency, the credit rating on the notes is downgraded or if the Company s credit rating is downgraded. The proceeds from this term note were used to fund
acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.  
      19  

The Company has maintained a $150 million unsecured term note maturing April 26, 2016 bearing interest at
6.38%. The Company used a draw on the line of credit to pay off the balance of this note on April 26, 2016.    The line of credit and term notes
require the Company to meet certain financial covenants, measured on a quarterly basis, including prescribed leverage, fixed charge coverage, minimum net worth, limitations on additional indebtedness and limitations on dividend payouts. At
September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants.    We believe that if operating results remain consistent with historical
levels and levels of other debt and liabilities remain consistent with amounts outstanding at September 30, 2016 the entire availability on the line of credit could be drawn without violating our debt covenants.  
 On May 17, 2016, the Company entered into two senior unsecured acquisition bridge facilities (the  Bridge Facilities ) totaling $1,675 million
with the Company s third-party advisors to the LS acquisition (see Note 4). In consideration for the bridge financing commitments, the Company paid fees totaling $7.3 million which are included as interest expense   acquisition bridge
financing commitment fee in the consolidated statements of operations for the nine month period ending September 30, 2016. The Bridge Facilities commitments were terminated on June 29, 2016.  
 On June 20, 2016, the Operating Partnership issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.50% unsecured senior notes due July 1, 2026 (the
 2026 Senior Notes ). The 2026 Senior Notes were issued at a 0.553% discount to par value. Interest on the 2026 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1, beginning on January 1, 2017. The 2026
Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company. Proceeds received upon issuance, net of discount to par of $3.3 million and underwriting discount and other offering expenses of $5.5 million, totaled $591.2 million. The
indenture under which the 2026 Senior Notes were issued restricts the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur debt unless the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries comply with a leverage ratio not to exceed 60% and an interest
coverage ratio of more than 1.5:1 on all outstanding debt, after giving effect to the incurrence of the debt. The indenture also restricts the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur secured debt unless the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries comply with a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 40% after giving effect to the incurrence of the debt. The indenture also contains other financial and customary covenants, including a covenant not to own unencumbered assets with
a value less than 150% of the unsecured indebtedness of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the 2026 Senior Notes.  
 During April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs, which amends the requirements for the presentation of debt issuance costs and requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that
debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU No. 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with retrospective application required. Consistent with the
guidance in ASU No. 2015-03 there are $3.4 million of debt issuance costs that have been presented as a reduction of term notes in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015 that were previously classified in other
assets prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2015-03. The implementation of this accounting standards update had no effect on our results of operations or cash flows.  
      20  

In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-15,  Imputation of Interest (Subtopic
835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  ( ASU 2015-15 ). ASU 2015-15 codifies an SEC staff announcement that entities are permitted to defer and present debt
issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as assets. ASU No. 2015-15 is effective for fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The implementation of this update did not
result in any changes to our consolidated financial statements.    The Company s fixed rate term notes contain a provision that allows for the
noteholders to call the debt upon a change of control of the Company at an amount that includes a make whole premium based on rates in effect on the date of the change of control. At this time no change in control is planned or anticipated.  

6.  
  MORTGAGES PAYABLE AND DEBT MATURITIES       Mortgages payable at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 consist of the following:      
   The table below summarizes the Company s debt obligations and interest rate derivatives at September 30, 2016. The
estimated fair value of financial instruments is subjective in nature and is dependent on a number of important assumptions, including discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument. The fair
value of the fixed rate term notes and mortgage notes were estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.
These assumptions are considered Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 8. The carrying values of our variable rate debt instruments approximate their fair values as these debt instruments bear interest at current market
rates that approximate market participant rates. This is considered a Level 2 input within the fair value hierarchy. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value
amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange.  
      21  

7.  
  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS       Interest rate swaps are used to adjust the proportion of total debt
that is subject to variable interest rates. The interest rate swaps require the Company to pay an amount equal to a specific fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in return an amount equal to a variable rate of
interest times the same notional amount. The notional amounts are not exchanged. Forward starting interest rate swaps are also used by the Company to hedge the risk of changes in the interest-related cash outflows associated with the potential
issuance of long-term debt. No other cash payments are made unless the contract is terminated prior to its maturity, in which case the contract would likely be settled for an amount equal to its fair value. The Company enters into interest rate
swaps with a number of major financial institutions to minimize counterparty credit risk.    The interest rate swaps qualify and are designated as hedges of
the amount of future cash flows related to interest payments on variable rate debt. Therefore, the interest rate swaps are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and the related gains or losses are deferred in shareholders 
equity or partners  capital as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ( AOCL ). These deferred gains and losses are recognized in interest expense during the period or periods in which the related interest payments affect earnings.
However, to the extent that the interest rate swaps are not perfectly effective in offsetting the change in value of the interest payments being hedged, the ineffective portion of these contracts is recognized in earnings immediately.
Ineffectiveness was de minimis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015.    The Company has interest rate swap agreements in
effect at September 30, 2016 as detailed below to effectively convert a total of $325 million of variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt.      
 
      22  

In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a
total notional value of $50 million. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company entered into additional forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of $100 million. These forward starting interest rate swap agreements
were entered into to hedge the risk of changes in the interest-related cash flows associated with the potential issuance of fixed rate long-term debt. In conjunction with the issuance of the $600 million 2026 Senior Notes (see Note 5), the Company
settled the forward starting swap agreements for a loss of approximately $9.2 million. The loss was recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized as additional interest expense over the ten-year term of the $600 million
2026 Senior Notes. Consistent with the Company s accounting policy, the cash outflow related to the settlement of the forward starting swap agreements is reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  
 The interest rate swap agreements are the only derivative instruments, as defined by FASB ASC Topic 815   Derivatives and Hedging  , held by
the Company. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net reclassification from AOCL to interest expense was $1.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively, based on payments made under the swap agreements. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net reclassification from AOCL to interest expense was $3.5 million and $3.9 million, respectively, based on payments made under the swap agreements. Reclassification of amounts included in AOCL at
September 30, 2016 to interest expense will be approximately $4.3 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017. Payments made under the interest rate swap agreements will be reclassified to interest expense as settlements occur or as
payments under the 2026 Senior Notes are made. The fair value of the swap agreements, including accrued interest, was a liability of $19.2 million at September 30, 2016, and an asset of $550,000 and a liability of $15.3 million at
December 31, 2015.    The Company s agreements with its interest rate swap counterparties contain provisions pursuant to which the Company could
be declared in default of its derivative obligations if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender. The interest rate swap agreements also incorporate
other loan covenants of the Company. Failure to comply with the loan covenant provisions would result in the Company being in default on the interest rate swap agreements. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not posted any collateral
related to the interest rate swap agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions as of September 30, 2016, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their net termination cost of $19.2
million.  
      23  

The changes in AOCL for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 are
summarized as follows:      

8.  
  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS       The Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 820   Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures   in determining the fair value of its financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities. ASC Topic 820 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This
hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A
financial asset or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  
 Refer to Note 6 for presentation of the fair values of debt obligations which are disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis.  
 The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 (in thousands):      
   Interest rate swaps are over the counter securities with no quoted readily available Level 1 inputs, and therefore are
measured at fair value using inputs that are directly observable in active markets and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, using the income approach.  
      24  

During 2016, assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis included the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of 120 storage facilities (see note 4), including the LS acquisition. To determine the fair value of land, the Company used prices per acre derived from observed transactions involving
comparable land in similar locations, which is considered a Level 2 input. To determine the fair value of buildings, equipment and improvements, the Company used current replacement cost based on information derived from construction industry data
by geographic region which is considered a Level 2 input. The replacement cost is then adjusted for the age, condition, and economic obsolescence associated with these assets, which are considered Level 3 inputs. The fair value of in-place customer
leases is based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers and the cost to replace in-place tenants which are based on the Company s historical experience with turnover at its facilities and on market
rental rates and estimated downtime required to replace the in-place leases, all of which are Level 3 inputs. The average downtime is based upon estimated demand information including the number of potential customers exhibited in historical
property interest data. The fair value of trade names is based on royalty payments avoided had the trade name been owned by a third party which is determined using market royalty rates. Other assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the
acquisitions consist primarily of prepaid or accrued real estate taxes and deferred revenues from advance monthly rentals paid by customers. The fair values of these assets and liabilities are based on their carrying values as they typically turn
over within one year from the acquisition date and these are Level 3 inputs.

  EARNINGS PER SHARE AND EARNINGS PER UNIT       The Company reports earnings per share and earnings per unit
data in accordance ASC Topic 260,   Earnings Per Share .  Effective January 1, 2009, FASB ASC Topic 260 was updated for the issuance of FASB Staff Position ( FSP ) EITF 03-6-1,   Determining Whether
Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities  , or FSP EITF 03-6-1, with transition guidance included in FASB ASC Topic 260-10-65-2. Under FSP EITF 03-6-1, unvested share-based payment awards that
contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings-per-share pursuant to the two-class method. The Parent Company and the
Operating Partnership have calculated their basic and diluted earnings per share/unit using the two-class method.  
      28  

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share utilizing the
two-class method.     (Loss) Earnings Per Share

  SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY       The following is a reconciliation of the changes in the Parent Company s
total shareholders  equity for the period:      
   On January 20, 2016, the Company completed the public offering of 2,645,000 shares of its common stock at $105.75 per
share. Net proceeds to the Company after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were approximately $269.7 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of the indebtedness then
outstanding on the Company s unsecured line of credit.    On May 25, 2016, the Company completed the public offering of 6,900,000 shares of its
common stock at $100.00 per share. Net proceeds to the Company after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were approximately $665.4 million. The Company initially used the net proceeds from the offering to repay the
indebtedness then outstanding on the Company s unsecured line of credit. The proceeds from this offering and the proceeds from the 2026 Senior Notes (see Note 5) were used, along with draws on the Company s revolving line of credit, to
fund the purchase of LS on July 15, 2016 (see Note 4).    On May 12, 2014, the Company entered into a continuous equity offering program
( Equity Program ) with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ( Wells Fargo ), Jefferies LLC ( Jefferies ), SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. ( SunTrust ), Piper Jaffray   Co. ( Piper ), HSBC
Securities (USA) Inc. ( HSBC ), and BB T Capital Markets, a division of BB T Securities, LLC ( BB T ), pursuant to which the Company may sell from time to time up to $225 million in aggregate offering price of shares
of the Company s common stock. Actual sales under the Equity Program will depend on a variety of factors and conditions, including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of the Company s common stock, and determinations
of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company. The Company expects to continue to offer, sell, and issue shares of common stock under the Equity Program from time to time based on various factors and conditions, although the Company is under
no obligation to sell any shares under the Equity Program.  
      30  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not issue any shares of common stock under
the Equity Program. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $59.3 million available for issuance under the Equity Program.    During the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, the Company issued 499,911 shares of common stock under the Equity Program at a weighted average issue price of $94.29 per share, generating net proceeds of $46.5 million after deducting $0.6 million of sales
commissions paid to Jefferies and Piper.    In 2013, the Company implemented a Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The Company issued 94,050 and 105,876 shares
under the plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.      
   The following is a reconciliation of the changes in total partners  capital
for the period:      

14.  
  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS       In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers,  which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605),  and requires an entity to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15,
2017. The Company has the option to apply the provisions of ASU 2014-09 either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of
initial application. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
      31  

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12,  Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award
Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period,  which requires a reporting entity to treat a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a
performance condition. ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2014-12 may be adopted either prospectively for share-based
payment awards granted or modified on or after the effective date, or retrospectively, using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach would apply to share-based payment awards outstanding as of the beginning of the
earliest annual period presented in the financial statements on adoption, and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 by the Company did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis . This ASU is effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 including interim periods within that reporting period. ASU 2015-02 amends the current consolidation model specifically as it relates to variable interest entities
( VIE s ) and provides reporting entities with a revised consolidation analysis procedure. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 by the Company did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments .
ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years,
and interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 by the Company did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . This guidance revises existing practice related to accounting for leases under
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840  Leases  (ASC 840) for both lessees and lessors. The new guidance in ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their leases (other than
leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments and the right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment such as for initial direct costs.
For income statement purposes, the new standard retains a dual model similar to ASC 840, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. For lessees, operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current
accounting by lessees for operating leases under ASC 840) while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current accounting by lessees for capital leases under ASC 840). While the new standard maintains similar
accounting for lessors as under ASC 840, the new standard reflects updates to, among other things, align with certain changes to the lessee model. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods, within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
      32  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call
Options in Debt Instruments . ASU 2016-06 simplifies the embedded derivative analysis for debt instruments containing contingent call or put options by removing the requirement to assess whether a contingent event is related to interest rates
or credit risks. The new standard will be effective for us on January 1, 2017. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-06 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,  Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity
Method of Accounting . ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an adjustment must be made to the
investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The new standard will be effective for us on
January 1, 2017. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-07 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  as part of its simplification initiative,
which involves several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in
this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on its
consolidated financial statements.    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash
Receipts and Cash Payments (a Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)  in an effort to reduce existing diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statements of cash flows. The
guidance addresses the classification of cash flows related to, among other things, distributions received from equity method investees. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and
interim periods within those annual periods. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

15.  
  COMMITMENT AND CONTINGENCIES       At September 30, 2016, the Company was under contract to acquire
seven self-storage facilities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $85.6 million. The purchase of these facilities is subject to customary conditions to closing, and there is no assurance that these facilities will be acquired.  
 On or about August 25, 2014, a putative class action was filed against the Company in the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division Burlington County.
The action seeks to obtain declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief for a class of consumers based upon alleged violations by the Company of the New Jersey Truth in Customer Contract, Warranty and Notice Act, the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and
the New Jersey Insurance Producer Licensing Act. On October 17, 2014, the action was removed from the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division Burlington County to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company
brought a motion to partially dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, and on July 16, 2015, the Company s motion was granted in part and denied in part. On October 20, 2016, the complaint was amended to add a claim that the
Company s insurance program violates New Jersey consumer protection laws. The Company intends to vigorously defend the action, and the possibility of any adverse outcome cannot be determined at this time.  
      33  

On October 4, 2016, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.95 per
common share. The dividend was paid on October 26, 2016 to shareholders of record on October 14, 2016. The total dividend paid amounted to $43.9 million.

Item 2.  
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       The
following discussion and analysis of the Company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.  
  DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS     When
used in this discussion and elsewhere in this document, the words  intends,   believes,   expects,   anticipates,  and similar expressions are intended to identify  forward-looking statements  within
the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may
cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of competition from new
self-storage facilities, which would cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; the Company s ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired businesses into the Company s existing business and operations; the Company s ability
to effectively compete in the industry in which it does business; the Company s existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment, preventing refinancing or forcing refinancing of the indebtedness on terms that are not as
favorable as the existing terms; interest rates may fluctuate, impacting costs associated with the Company s outstanding floating rate debt; the Company s ability to comply with debt covenants; any future ratings on the Company s debt
instruments; regional concentration of the Company s business may subject it to economic downturns in the states of Florida and Texas; the Company s reliance on its call center; the Company s cash flow may be insufficient to meet
required payments of operating expenses, principal, interest and dividends; and tax law changes that may change the taxability of future income.  
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     FOR THE PERIOD JULY 1, 2016
THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, COMPARED TO THE PERIOD JULY 1, 2015 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2015    We recorded rental revenues of $118.3 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $30.2 million or 34.4% when compared to rental revenues of $88.1 million for the same period in 2015. Of the increase in rental revenue, $3.6 million resulted from a 4.3% increase in rental
revenues at the 417 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2015, excluding the properties we sold in 2015 and 2016, and excluding stores not yet
stabilized and three stores significantly impacted by flooding in 2016). The increase in same store rental revenues was a result of a 30 basis point increase in average occupancy and a 3.7% increase in rental income per square foot. The remaining
increase in rental revenue of $26.6 million resulted from the revenues from the acquisition of properties completed since January 1, 2015 and stores not yet stabilized. Other operating income, which includes merchandise sales, insurance
administrative fees, truck rentals, management fees and acquisition fees, increased by $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of increased administrative fees earned
on customer insurance.  
      35  

Property operations and maintenance expenses increased $7.4 million or 35.4% in the three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The 417 core properties considered in the same store pool experienced a $0.2 million or 0.8% increase in operating expenses as a result of higher payroll and benefit costs and increased
repairs and maintenance expense. In addition to the same store operating expense increase, operating expenses increased $7.2 million from the acquisition of properties completed since January 1, 2015 and stores not yet stabilized. Real estate
tax expense increased $3.9 million as a result of a 3.8% increase in property taxes on the 417 same store pool and the inclusion of taxes on the properties acquired in 2016 and 2015.  
 Net operating income increased $21.1 million or 32.3% as a result of a 5.8% increase in our same store net operating income and the acquisitions completed
since January 1, 2015.    Net operating income or  NOI  is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that we
define as total continuing revenues less continuing property operating expenses. NOI also can be calculated by adding back to net (loss) income: interest expense, impairment and casualty losses, operating lease expense, depreciation and amortization
expense, acquisition related costs, general and administrative expense, and deducting from net (loss) income: income from discontinued operations, interest income, gain on sale of real estate, and equity in income of joint ventures. We believe that
NOI is a meaningful measure to investors in evaluating our operating performance because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, and in comparing period-to-period and
market-to-market property operating results. Additionally, NOI is widely used in the real estate industry and the self-storage industry to measure the performance and value of real estate assets without regard to various items included in net income
that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending on accounting methods and the book value of assets. NOI should be considered in addition to, but not as a
substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, operating income and net (loss) income. There are material limitations to using a measure such as NOI, including the difficulty
associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net (loss) income. We compensate for these limitations
by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net (loss) income. The following table reconciles NOI generated by our self-storage facilities to our net (loss) income
presented in the consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      
 
      36  

Our 2016 same store results consist of only those properties that were included in our consolidated results since
January 1, 2015, excluding three stores purchased prior to January 1, 2015 that have not yet stabilized and three stores significantly impacted by flooding in 2016. The following table sets forth operating data for our 417 same store
properties. These results provide information relating to property operating changes without the effects of acquisitions.    Same Store Summary  
   
   We believe the increase in same store move ins was a byproduct of additional move in incentives. We believe the decrease in
same store move outs was a result of customers increasing their length of stay.    General and administrative expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 increased $1.5 million or 16.5% compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015. The key drivers of the increase were a $0.6 million increase in professional fees and a $0.3 million increase in salaries and
benefits.    Acquisition related costs were $25.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the acquisition of 86 stores
during that period. This amount includes $15.5 million of prepayment penalties and defeasance costs to retire LS s debt upon closing of the acquisition of LS. Acquisition related costs for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were
$1.0 million for the 11 stores acquired during that period.    Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $41.4 million in the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $14.7 million in the same period of 2015, primarily as a result of depreciation on the properties acquired in 2015 and 2016 and accelerated depreciation on existing signage that is being replaced as a result of the
change in name of the Company s storage facilities from Uncle Bob s Self Storage     to Life Storage    .  
 Total interest expense increased $5.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result
of the $600 million 3.5% senior notes issued in June 2016 and the $200 million 3.67% term loan entered into in July 2016, partially offset by reduced interest costs as a result of the payoff of the $150 million 6.38% term loan in April 2016 with a
draw on our line of credit which carries a lower interest rate.  
      37  

FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2016 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, COMPARED TO THE PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2015 THROUGH
SEPTEMBER 30, 2015    We recorded rental revenues of $308.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $58.3 million or 23.2%
when compared to rental revenues of $250.4 million for the same period in 2015. Of the increase in rental revenue, $13.1 million resulted from a 5.4% increase in rental revenues at the 417 core properties considered in same store sales (those
properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2015, excluding the properties we sold in 2015 and 2016, and excluding stores not yet stabilized and three stores significantly impacted by flooding in 2016). The
increase in same store rental revenues was a result of a 50 basis point increase in average occupancy and a 4.8% increase in rental income per square foot. The remaining increase in rental revenue of $45.2 million resulted from the revenues from the
acquisition of properties completed since January 1, 2015 and stores not yet stabilized. Other operating income, which includes merchandise sales, insurance administrative fees, truck rentals, management fees and acquisition fees, increased by
$4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of increased administrative fees earned on customer insurance and as a result of the impact of properties acquired in 2015 and
2016.    Property operations and maintenance expenses increased $13.4 million or 22.0% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same
period in 2015. The 417 core properties considered in the same store pool experienced a $0.2 million or 0.3% increase in operating expenses as a result of higher payroll and benefit costs, increased bank charges and increased internet marketing
costs, partially offset by decreases in utilities, insurance and snow removal costs. In addition to the same store operating expense increase, operating expenses increased $13.2 million from the acquisition of properties completed since
January 1, 2015 and stores not yet stabilized. Real estate tax expense increased $7.4 million as a result of a 5.3% increase in property taxes on the 417 same store pool and the inclusion of taxes on the properties acquired in 2016 and 2015.
   Net operating income increased $41.6 million or 22.7% as a result of a 7.4% increase in our same store net operating income and the acquisitions
completed since January 1, 2015.    The following table reconciles NOI generated by our self-storage facilities to our net income presented in the
consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      
 
      38  

Our 2016 same store results consist of only those properties that were included in our consolidated results since
January 1, 2015, excluding three stores purchased prior to January 1, 2015 that have not yet stabilized and three stores significantly impacted by flooding in 2016. The following table sets forth operating data for our 417 same store
properties. These results provide information relating to property operating changes without the effects of acquisitions.    Same Store Summary  
   
   We believe the decrease in same store move ins was a byproduct of our increased occupancy, leaving fewer spaces to rent. We
believe the decrease in same store move outs was a result of customers increasing their length of stay.    General and administrative expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 increased $3.0 million or 10.6% compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The key drivers of the increase were a $1.3 million increase in professional fees and a $0.9 million increase in
salaries and benefits.    Acquisition related costs were $29.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the acquisition of
120 stores during that period. This amount includes $15.5 million of prepayment penalties and defeasance costs to retire LS s debt upon closing of the acquisition of LS. Acquisition related costs for the nine months ended September 30,
2015 were $2.4 million for the 19 stores acquired during that period.    The operating lease expense for storage facilities in 2015 relates to leases which
commenced in November 2013 with respect to four self-storage facilities in New York (2) and Connecticut (2). We completed the purchase of these four facilities on February 2, 2015, which eliminated the lease payment at that time.  
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $76.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $43.4 million in the same period of
2015, primarily as a result of depreciation on the properties acquired in 2015 and 2016 and accelerated depreciation on existing signage that will be replaced as a result of the change in name of the Company s storage facilities from Uncle
Bob s Self Storage     to Life Storage    .  
      39  

Total interest expense increased $11.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the same period in 2015 as a result of a $7.3 million bridge loan commitment fee that was incurred related to the LS acquisition bid, coupled with an increase as a result of the $600 million 3.5% senior notes issued in June 2016 and the $200 million
3.67% term loan entered into in July 2016. The bridge loan was not drawn on by the Company and the related fees were recorded as interest expense.    During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we sold eight storage facilities in Alabama (1), Georgia (1), Mississippi (1), Texas (1), and Virginia (4) for net proceeds of approximately $34.1 million, resulting in a $15.3 million gain on sale.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we sold one storage facility in Missouri for net proceeds of approximately $691,000, resulting in a loss on sale of $7,000.  
  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS     We believe that Funds from
Operations ( FFO ) provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net (loss) earnings and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. FFO adds back historical
cost depreciation, which assumes the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably in the future. In fact, real estate asset values increase or decrease with market conditions. Consequently, we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure in
evaluating our operating performance by disregarding (or adding back) historical cost depreciation.    FFO is defined by the National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ( NAREIT ) as net income available to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, plus
impairment of real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance FFO should be compared
with our reported net (loss) income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.    In October and
November of 2011, NAREIT issued guidance for reporting FFO that reaffirmed NAREIT s view that impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate should be excluded from the computation of FFO. This view is based on the fact that impairment
write-downs are akin to and effectively reflect the early recognition of losses on prospective sales of depreciable property or represent adjustments of previously charged depreciation. Since depreciation of real estate and gains/losses from sales
are excluded from FFO, it is NAREIT s view that it is consistent and appropriate for write-downs of depreciable real estate to also be excluded. Our calculation of FFO excludes impairment write-downs of investments in storage facilities.  
 Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the
current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net (loss)
income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to
make cash distributions.  
      40  

Reconciliation of Net (Loss) Income to Funds From Operations (unaudited)    
   
    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
 Our line of credit and term notes require us to meet certain financial covenants measured on a quarterly basis, including prescribed leverage, fixed charge
coverage, minimum net worth, limitations on additional indebtedness, and limitations on dividend payouts. At September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. In the event that the Company violates its debt covenants in
the future, the amounts due under the agreements could be callable by the lenders and could adversely affect our credit rating requiring us to pay higher interest and other debt-related costs. We believe that if operating results remain consistent
with historical levels and levels of other debt and liabilities remain consistent with amounts outstanding at September 30, 2016, the entire availability under our line of credit could be drawn without violating our debt covenants.  
 Our ability to retain cash flow is limited because we operate as a REIT. In order to maintain our REIT status, a substantial portion of our operating cash
flow must be used to pay dividends to our shareholders. We believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities and the availability on our line of credit will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations, capital
improvements, dividends and debt service requirements.    Cash flows from operating activities were $149.4 million and $138.1 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in operating cash flows in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period was primarily due to the increase in net income after adjusting for non-cash items.  
 Cash used in investing activities was $1,755.0 million and $298.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
increase in cash used in investing activities in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period was primarily due to the increased volume of acquisitions in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  
      41  

Cash provided by financing activities was $1,614.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to $158.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On January 20, 2016, the Company completed the public offering of 2,645,000 shares of its common stock at $105.75 per share. Net proceeds to the Company after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were approximately $269.7 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of the indebtedness then outstanding on the Company s unsecured
line of credit which had been used to fund acquisitions in the first quarter of 2016. Also on May 25, 2016, the Company completed the public offering of 6,900,000 shares of its common stock at $100.00 per share. Net proceeds to the Company
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were approximately $665.4 million. The Company initially used the net proceeds from the offering to repay the indebtedness then outstanding on the Company s unsecured
line of credit, with a portion held in cash at June 30, 2016. The proceeds from the May offering, the proceeds from the Company s June 2016 unsecured senior notes offering, and draws on the line of credit were used to fund the purchase of
LS in July 2016 for approximately $1.3 billion.    On March 3, 2015, the Company completed the public offering of 1,380,000 shares of its common stock
at $90.40 per share. Net proceeds to the Company after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were approximately $119.5 million, and when combined with the exercise of stock options, and the sale of common stock
through our dividend reinvestment plan, resulted in net cash proceeds from the sale of common stock of $145.0 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of the indebtedness outstanding on the Company s
unsecured line of credit.    In January 2016, the Company exercised the expansion feature of its existing amended unsecured credit agreement and increased
the revolving credit limit from $300 million to $500 million. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on the Company s credit rating (at September 30, 2016 the
margin is 1.10%), and requires a 0.15% facility fee. The amended agreement also reduced the interest rate on the $325 million unsecured term note maturing June 4, 2020, with the term note bearing interest at LIBOR plus a margin based on the
Company s credit rating (at September 30, 2016 the margin is 1.15%). The interest rate at September 30, 2016 on the Company s line of credit was approximately 1.62% (1.72% at December 31, 2015). At September 30, 2016,
there was $260 million available on the unsecured line of credit. The revolving line of credit has a maturity date of December 10, 2019.    On
July 21, 2016, the Company entered into a $200 million term note maturing July 21, 2028 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 3.67%. The proceeds from this term note were used to repay a portion of the then outstanding balance on the
Company s line of credit.    The Company had maintained a $150 million unsecured term note that matured on April 26, 2016 bearing interest at
6.38%. The Company used a draw on the line of credit to pay off the balance of this note on April 26, 2016.    On June 20, 2016, the Company
issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.50% unsecured senior notes due July 1, 2026 (the  2026 Senior Notes ). Net proceeds to the Company after original issue discount, underwriting discounts and commissions and
offering expenses were approximately $591.2 million. On July 15, 2016, the proceeds from the 2026 Senior Notes, the proceeds from the Company s common stock offering in May 2016, and draws on the Company s line of credit were used to
fund the acquisiton of LS. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2026 Senior Notes, the Company settled its $150 million notional forward starting swap agreements for cash of approximately $9.2 million.  
 Our line of credit facility and term notes have an investment grade rating from Standard and Poor s and Fitch Ratings (BBB), as well as Moody s
(Baa2).  
      42  

In addition to the unsecured financing mentioned above, our consolidated financial statements also include $10.1
million of mortgages payable that are secured by three storage facilities. The increase in mortgages payable from 2015 to 2016 was a result of two mortgages that were assumed in connection with the acquisition of two properties in 2016.  
 On May 12, 2014, the Company entered into a continuous equity offering program ( Equity Program ) with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ( Wells
Fargo ), Jefferies LLC ( Jefferies ), SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. ( SunTrust ), Piper Jaffray   Co. ( Piper ), HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. ( HSBC ), and BB T Capital Markets, a division
of BB T Securities, LLC ( BB T ), pursuant to which the Company may sell from time to time up to $225 million in aggregate offering price of shares of the Company s common stock. Actual sales under the Equity Program will
depend on a variety of factors and conditions, including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of the Company s common stock, and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company. The Company expects to
continue to offer, sell, and issue shares of common stock under the Equity Program from time to time based on various factors and conditions, although the Company is under no obligation to sell any shares under the Equity Program.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not issue any shares of common stock under the Equity Program. As of September 30,
2016, the Company had $59.3 million available for issuance under the Equity Program.    In 2013, the Company implemented a Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The
Company issued 94,050 shares under the plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    Future acquisitions, our expansion and enhancement
program, and share repurchases are expected to be funded with draws on our line of credit, issuance of common and preferred stock, the issuance of unsecured term notes, sale of properties, and private placement solicitation of joint venture equity.
Should the capital markets deteriorate, we may have to curtail acquisitions, our expansion and enhancement program and share repurchases.     ACQUISITION
AND DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES     In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company acquired 120 self-storage facilities comprising
9.3 million square feet in Arizona (1), California (22), Colorado (6), Connecticut (2), Florida (10), Illinois (24), Massachusetts (1), Mississippi (1), New Hampshire (5), Nevada (17), New York (4), Pennsylvania (1), South Carolina (1), Texas
(23), Utah (1), and Wisconsin (1) for a total purchase price of $1,765.5 million. Based on the trailing financial information of the entities from which the properties were acquired, the weighted average capitalization rate was 3.6% on these
purchases and ranged from 0% on recently constructed facilities to 6.7% on mature facilities.    In 2015, we acquired 27 self-storage facilities comprising
2.0 million square feet in Arizona (1), Connecticut (2), Florida (6), Illinois (2), Massachusetts (1), New York (6), North Carolina (1), Pennsylvania (1), South Carolina (6) and Texas (1) for a total purchase price of $281.2 million.
Based on the trailing financial information of the entities from which the properties were acquired, the weighted average capitalization rate was 5.3% on these purchases and ranged from 0% on recently constructed facilities to 6.4% on mature
facilities. Four facilities acquired in Connecticut and New York in 2015 had been leased by the Company since November 1, 2013 and the operating results of these four facilities have been included in the Company s operations since that
date.  
      43  

During 2016 the Company sold eight non-strategic properties with a carrying value of $18.8 million and received
cash proceeds of $34.1 million, resulting in a $15.3 million gain on sale. During 2015 the Company sold three non-strategic properties purchased in 2014 and 2015 with a carrying value of $5.1 million and received cash proceeds of $4.6 million,
resulting in a $0.5 million loss on sale.    We may seek to sell additional properties to third parties or joint venture partners in 2016.  
  FUTURE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS     Our external
growth strategy is to increase the number of facilities we own by acquiring suitable facilities in markets in which we already have operations, or to expand into new markets by acquiring several facilities at once in those new markets. We are
actively pursuing acquisitions in 2016, and at September 30, 2016, we were under contract to acquire seven self-storage facilities for aggregate consideration of approximately $85.6 million.  
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we added 299,656 square feet to existing properties for a total cost of approximately $18.3 million. We plan
to complete an additional $8.7 million of expansions and enhancements to our existing facilities in 2016.    We also expect to continue making capital
expenditures on our properties. This includes roofing, paving, remodeling of store offices, and replacement of Uncle Bob s Self Storage     signage with Life Storage     signage. For the first nine months of 2016 we spent approximately $19.9 million on such improvements and we expect to spend approximately $14.6 million for the remainder of 2016.  
  REIT QUALIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS     As a
REIT, we are not required to pay federal income tax on income that we distribute to our shareholders, provided that we satisfy certain requirements, including distributing at least 90% of our REIT taxable income for a taxable year. These
distributions must be made in the year to which they relate, or in the following year if declared before we file our federal income tax return, and if they are paid not later than the date of the first regular dividend of the following year. As a
REIT, we must derive at least 95% of our total gross income from income related to real property, interest and dividends.    Although we currently intend to
operate in a manner designed to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause our Board of Directors to revoke our REIT election.  
      44  

UMBRELLA PARTNERSHIP REIT   
 We are formed as an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust ( UPREIT ) and, as such, have the ability to issue Operating Partnership Units
in exchange for properties sold by independent owners. By utilizing such Units as currency in facility acquisitions, we may obtain more favorable pricing or terms due to the seller s ability to partially defer their income tax liability. As of
September 30, 2016, 196,008 Units are outstanding. These Units had been issued in exchange for self-storage properties at the request of the sellers.  
  INTEREST RATE RISK     The primary market risk to which we
believe we are exposed is interest rate risk, which may result from many factors, including government monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors that are beyond our control.  
 We have entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt. The LIBOR
base rates have been contractually fixed on $325 million of our debt through the interest rate swap termination dates. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  
 Based on our outstanding unsecured floating rate debt of $565 million at September 30, 2016, and taking into account our interest rate swap agreements, a
100 basis point increase in interest rates would have a $2.4 million effect on our annual interest expense. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest rate swap
agreements in effect on September 30, 2016. These analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we
would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital
structure.     INFLATION     We do not believe that
inflation has had or will have a direct effect on our operations. Substantially all of the leases at the facilities are on a month-to-month basis which provides us with the opportunity to increase rental rates as each lease matures.  
  SEASONALITY     Our revenues typically have been higher in
the third and fourth quarters, primarily because self-storage facilities tend to experience greater occupancy during the late spring, summer and early fall months due to the greater incidence of residential moves and college student activity during
these periods. However, we believe that our customer mix, diverse geographic locations, rental structure and expense structure provide adequate protection against undue fluctuations in cash flows and net revenues during off-peak seasons. Thus, we do
not expect seasonality to affect materially distributions to shareholders.     RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

PART II.  
  Other Information         

Item 1.  
  Legal Proceedings       On or about August 25, 2014, a putative class action was filed against the
Company in the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division Burlington County. The action seeks to obtain declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief for a class of consumers based upon alleged violations by the Company of the New Jersey Truth in
Customer Contract, Warranty and Notice Act, the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and the New Jersey Insurance Producer Licensing Act. On October 17, 2014, the action was removed from the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division Burlington County
to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company brought a motion to partially dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, and on July 16, 2015, the Company s motion was granted in part and denied in
part. On October 20, 2016, the complaint was amended to add a claim that the Company s insurance program violates New Jersey consumer protection laws. The Company intends to vigorously defend the action, and the possibility of any adverse
outcome cannot be determined at this time.      

Item 1A.  
  Risk Factors       In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully
