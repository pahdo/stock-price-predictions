  (unaudited)     The unaudited
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Barnes   Noble, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Barnes   Noble or the Company).  
 In the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company contain all
adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly its consolidated financial position as of October 29, 2016 and the results of its operations for the 13 and 26 weeks and its cash flows for the 26 weeks
then ended. These consolidated financial statements are condensed and therefore do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles. The consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2016 (fiscal 2016).    Due to the
seasonal nature of the business, the results of operations for the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 are not indicative of the results expected for the 52 weeks ending April 29, 2017 (fiscal 2017).  

1.  
  Separation of Barnes   Noble Education, Inc.       On February 26, 2015,
Barnes   Noble announced plans for the legal and structural separation of Barnes   Noble Education, Inc. (Barnes   Noble Education or B N Education) (formerly known as NOOK Media Inc.) from Barnes   Noble into
an independent public company (the Spin-Off).    On July 14, 2015, the Barnes   Noble board of directors (the Board) approved
the final distribution ratio and declared a pro rata dividend of the outstanding shares of B N Education common stock, which resulted in the complete legal and structural separation of the two companies. The distribution was subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as set forth in B N Education s Registration Statement on Form S-1, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 26, 2015 and was amended on April 29,
2015, June 4, 2015, June 29, 2015, July 13, 2015, July 14, 2015 and July 15, 2015.    On
August 2, 2015, Barnes   Noble completed the Spin-Off of Barnes   Noble Education and distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of B N Education common stock to the Company s stockholders of record as of
July 27, 2015. These Barnes   Noble stockholders of record as of July 27, 2015 received a distribution of 0.632 shares of B N Education common stock for each share of Barnes   Noble common stock held as of the record
date. Immediately following the completion of the Spin-Off, the Company s stockholders owned 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of B N Education. Following the Spin-Off, B N Education operates as an independent public
company and as the parent of Barnes   Noble College, trading on New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol  BNED .  
 In connection with the separation of B N Education, the Company and B N Education entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement
on July 14, 2015 and several other ancillary agreements on August 2, 2015. These agreements govern the relationship between the Company and B N Education after the separation and allocate between the Company and B N Education
various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations following the separation, including employee benefits, intellectual property, information technology, insurance and tax-related assets and liabilities. The agreements also describe the
Company s future commitments to provide B N Education with certain transition services.    This Spin-Off is expected to be a
non-taxable event for Barnes   Noble and its shareholders, and Barnes   Noble s U.S. shareholders (other than those subject to special rules) generally will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the distribution of B N
Education shares.      

2.  
  History of Barnes   Noble Education, Inc.       On September 30, 2009,
Barnes   Noble acquired Barnes   Noble College Booksellers, LLC (B N College) from Leonard and Louise Riggio. From that date until October 4, 2012, B N College was wholly owned by Barnes   Noble Booksellers,
Inc. B N Education was initially incorporated under the name NOOK Media Inc. in July 2012 to hold Barnes   Noble s B N College and NOOK digital businesses. On October 4, 2012, Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) acquired a
17.6% non-controlling preferred membership interest in B N Education s subsidiary B N Education, LLC (formerly NOOK Media LLC) (the LLC), and through B N Education, Barnes   Noble maintained an 82.4% controlling interest of
the B N College and NOOK digital businesses.  
      9  

Table of Contents  

  On January 22, 2013, Pearson Education, Inc. (Pearson) acquired a 5% non-controlling
preferred membership interest in the LLC, entered into a commercial agreement with the LLC relating to the B N College business and received warrants to purchase an additional preferred membership interest in the LLC.  
 On December 4, 2014, B N Education re-acquired Microsoft s interest in the LLC in exchange for cash and common stock of
Barnes   Noble and the Microsoft commercial agreement was terminated effective as of such date. On December 22, 2014, B N Education also re-acquired Pearson s interest in the LLC and certain related warrants previously issued
to Pearson. In connection with these transactions, Barnes   Noble entered into contingent payment agreements with Microsoft and Pearson providing for additional payments upon the occurrence of certain events, including upon a sale of the
NOOK digital business. As a result of these transactions, Barnes   Noble owned, prior to the Spin-Off, 100% of B N Education.  
 On May 1, 2015, B N Education distributed to Barnes   Noble all of the membership interests in B N Education s NOOK
digital business. As a result, B N Education ceased to own any interest in the NOOK digital business, which remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Barnes   Noble.      

3.  
  Discontinued Operations of Barnes   Noble Education, Inc.       The Company has
recognized the separation of B N Education in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-20,  Discontinued Operations . As such, the historical results of Barnes   Noble Education have been adjusted to include
separation-related costs and exclude corporate allocations with B N Retail, and have been classified as discontinued operations.  
 Discontinued operations in the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015 primarily consisted of investment banking fees (as it directly related to
the Spin-Off) and separation-related costs.    Discontinued operations in the 26 weeks ended October 31, 2015 primarily consisted of
pre-spin B N Education results, investment banking fees (as it directly related to the Spin-Off), separation-related costs and excluded corporate allocation adjustments with B N Retail.  
 The following unaudited financial information presents the discontinued operations for the 13 and 26 weeks ended October 31, 2015:

4.  
  EBook Settlement       The Company provided credits to eligible customers resulting from the
settlement reached with Apple Inc. (Apple) in an antitrust lawsuit filed by various State Attorneys General and private class plaintiffs regarding the price of digital books. The Company s customers were entitled to $95,707 in total credits as
a result of the settlement, which is funded by Apple. If a customer s credit is not used to make a purchase within one year, the entire credit will expire. The Company recorded estimated redemptions of $56,527 during fiscal 2016 as a receivable
from the Apple settlement fund and a liability to its customers with a deadline of June 2017 for the activation of all credits. As of October 29, 2016, the Company s customers had activated $50,610 in credits, of which $39,771 were
redeemed. Total receivables from the Apple settlement fund were $7,616 as of October 29, 2016.      

5.  
  Merchandise Inventories       Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is determined primarily by the retail inventory method under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. NOOK merchandise inventories are recorded based on the average cost method.  
 Market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value, which is generally the selling price. Reserves for non-returnable inventory
are based on the Company s history of liquidating non-returnable inventory.    The Company also estimates and accrues shortage for the
period between the last physical count of inventory and the balance sheet date. Shortage rates are estimated and accrued based on historical rates and can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends.  

6.  
  Revenue Recognition       Revenue from sales of the Company s products is recognized at
the time of sale or shipment, other than those with multiple elements and Free On Board (FOB) destination point shipping terms. The Company accrues for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related revenue is recognized based on
historical experience. ECommerce revenue from sales of products ordered through the Company s websites is recognized upon estimated delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers. Freight costs are included within the Company s cost
of sales and occupancy. Sales taxes collected from retail customers are excluded from reported revenues. All of the Company s sales are recognized as revenue on a  net  basis, including sales in connection with any periodic promotions
offered to customers. The Company does not treat any promotional offers as expenses.    In accordance with ASC 605-25,  Revenue
Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements,  and Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) 2009-13 and 2009-14, for multiple-element arrangements that involve tangible products that contain software that is essential to the tangible product s
functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software and other separable elements, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables using the relative selling-price method. Under this method,
revenue is allocated at the time of sale to all deliverables based on their relative selling price using a specific hierarchy. The hierarchy is as follows: vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence of selling price, or best estimate
of selling price. NOOK    device revenue is recognized at the segment point of sale.  
 The Company includes post-service customer support (PCS) in the form of software updates and potential increased functionality on a
when-and-if-available basis with the purchase of a NOOK    from the Company. Using the relative selling-price method described above, the Company allocates revenue based on the best estimate of
selling price for the deliverables as no vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence exists for any of the elements. Revenue allocated to NOOK    and the software essential to its
functionality is recognized at the time of sale, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition are met. Revenue allocated to the PCS is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 2-year estimated life of a NOOK    device.    The average percentage of a NOOK    s sales price that is deferred for undelivered items and recognized over its 2-year estimated life ranges between 0% and 5%, depending on the type of device sold. The amount of NOOK   -related deferred revenue as of October 29, 2016, October 31, 2015 and April 30, 2016 was $354, $675 and $160, respectively. These amounts are classified on the Company s
balance sheet in accrued liabilities for the portion that is subject to deferral for one year or less and other long-term liabilities for the portion that is subject to deferral for more than one year.  
 The Company also pays certain vendors who distributed NOOK    a commission on the
content sales sold through that device. The Company accounted for these transactions as a reduction in the sales price of the NOOK    based on historical trends of content sales and a liability
was established for the estimated commission expected to be paid over the life of the product. The Company recognizes revenue of the content at the point of sale of the content. The Company records revenue from sales of digital content, sales of
third-party extended warranties, service contracts and other products, for which the Company is not obligated to perform, and for which the Company does not meet the criteria for gross revenue recognition under ASC 605-45-45,  Reporting Revenue
Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent , on a net basis. All other revenue is recognized on a gross basis.  
      11

  The Company rents physical textbooks. Revenue from the rental of physical textbooks is deferred
and recognized over the rental period commencing at point of sale. The Company offers a buyout option to allow the purchase of a rented book at the end of the semester. The Company records the buyout purchase when the customer exercises and
pays the buyout option price. In these instances, the Company would accelerate any remaining deferred rental revenue at the point of sale.  
 NOOK acquires the rights to distribute digital content from publishers and distributes the content on www.barnesandnoble.com, NOOK    devices and other eBookstore platforms. Certain digital content is distributed under an agency pricing model, in which the publishers set prices for eBooks and NOOK receives a commission on
content sold through the eBookstore. The majority of the Company s eBooks are sold under the agency model.    The Barnes  
Noble Member Program offers members greater discounts and other benefits for products and services, as well as exclusive offers and promotions via e-mail or direct mail, for an annual fee of $25.00, which is non-refundable after the first 30 days.
Revenue is recognized over the 12-month period based upon historical spending patterns for Barnes   Noble Members.    In May 2014,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (ASU 2014-09). The standard provides companies with a single model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with
customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The core principle of the model is to recognize revenue when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer, as opposed to
recognizing revenue when the risks and rewards transfer to the customer under the existing revenue guidance. ASU 2014-09, as amended by ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The guidance permits companies to either apply the requirements
retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the impact of adoption on its
consolidated financial statements.      

7.  
  Research and Development Costs for Software Products       The Company follows the guidance
in ASC 985-20,  Cost of Software to Be Sold, Leased or Marketed , regarding research and development costs for software products to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. Capitalization of software development costs begins upon the
establishment of technological feasibility and is discontinued when the product is available for sale. A certain amount of judgment and estimation is required to assess when technological feasibility is established, as well as for the ongoing
assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs. The Company s products reach technological feasibility shortly before the products are released and, therefore, research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred.  

8.  
  Internal-Use Software and Website Development Costs       Direct costs incurred to develop
software for internal use and website development costs are capitalized and amortized over an estimated useful life of three to seven years. The Company capitalized costs, primarily related to labor, consulting, hardware and software, of $10,622 and
$17,221 during the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $6,154 and $8,156 during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015,
respectively, and $12,749 and $15,242 during the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. Costs related to the design or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are expensed as incurred.  

9.  
  Net Earnings (Loss) per Share       In accordance with ASC 260-10-45,  Share-Based Payment
Arrangements and Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method , unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends are considered participating securities. The Company s unvested restricted
shares and unvested restricted stock units granted prior to July 15, 2015 and shares issuable under the Company s deferred compensation plan are considered participating securities. Cash dividends to restricted stock units and
performance-based stock units granted on or after July 15, 2015 are not distributed until and except to the extent that the restricted stock units vest, and in the case of performance-based stock units, until and except to the extent that the
performance metrics are achieved or are otherwise deemed satisfied. Stock options do not receive cash dividends. As such, these awards are not considered participating securities.  
      12  

Table of Contents  

  Basic earnings per common share are calculated by dividing the net income, adjusted for preferred
dividends and income allocated to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share reflects the dilution that would occur if any potentially dilutive
instruments were exercised or converted into common shares. The dilutive effect of participating securities is calculated using the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or two-class method. Other potentially dilutive securities include
preferred stock, stock options, restricted stock units granted after July 15, 2015, and performance-based stock units and are included in diluted shares to the extent they are dilutive under the treasury stock method for the applicable periods.
   During periods of net loss, no effect is given to the participating securities because they do not share in the losses of the Company.
Due to the net loss during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 and the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, participating securities in the amounts of 1,224,579, 2,330,973, 1,305,303 and
2,512,070, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of loss per share using the two-class method because the effect would be antidilutive. The Company s outstanding non-participating securities consisting of dilutive stock options of
75,438, 198,596, 81,338 and 170,247 for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, and the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively, and accretion/payments of dividends on preferred shares
were also excluded from the calculation of loss per share using the two-class method because the effect would be antidilutive.    The
following is a reconciliation of the Company s basic and diluted loss per share calculation:

www.barnesandnoble.com, on NOOK    devices and at B N Education stores. The Company does not charge administrative or dormancy fees on gift cards and gift cards have no expiration dates.
Upon the purchase of a gift card, a liability is established for its cash value. Revenue associated with gift cards is deferred until redemption of the gift card. Gift cards redeemed at B N Education are funded by the gift card liability at the
Company. Over time, a portion of the gift cards issued is typically not redeemed. The Company estimates the portion of the gift card liability for which the likelihood of redemption is remote based upon the Company s historical redemption
patterns. The Company records this amount in income on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period beginning in the 13 th  month after the month the gift card was originally sold. The Company does
not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize revenue associated with gift cards. Additional breakage may be required if gift card redemptions continue to run
lower than historical patterns.    The Company recognized gift card breakage of $4,835 and $5,198 during the 13 weeks ended October 29,
2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively, and $9,756 and $10,588 during the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. The Company had gift card liabilities of $344,044 and $330,474 as of October 29, 2016
and October 31, 2015, respectively.      

13.  
  Other Long-Term Liabilities       Other long-term liabilities consist primarily of deferred
rent, tax liabilities and reserves, long-term insurance liabilities and asset retirement obligations. The Company provides for minimum rent expense over the lease terms (including the build-out period) on a straight-line basis. The excess of
such rent expense over actual lease payments (net of tenant allowances) is classified as deferred rent. Other long-term liabilities also include store closing expenses and long-term deferred revenues. The Company had the following other
long-term liabilities at October 29, 2016, October 31, 2015 and April 30, 2016:

The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $10,817 on a pre-tax loss of
$31,226 during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, which represented an effective income tax rate of 34.6%. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $30,694 on pre-tax loss of $57,897 during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015, which
represented an effective income tax rate of 53.0%.    The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $19,419 on a pre-tax loss of $54,244
during the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016, which represented an effective income tax rate of 35.8%. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $31,547 on pre-tax loss of $66,501 during the 26 weeks ended October 31, 2015, which
represented an effective income tax rate of 47.4%.    The income tax benefits for the 13 and 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and
October 31, 2015, respectively, differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of permanent items such as meals and entertainment, non-deductible executive compensation, tax credits, changes in uncertain tax positions and the impact of
return to provision adjustments and state income taxes, net of federal benefit. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance against certain state items.

  Fair Values of Financial Instruments       In accordance with ASC 820,  Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures  (ASC 820), the fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties. A liability s fair value is
defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair
value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include:      

Level 1 

Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets  

Level 2 

Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  

Level 3 

Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions  
   The Company s financial instruments include cash, receivables, gift cards, accrued liabilities, accounts
payable and its credit facility. The fair values of cash, receivables, gift cards, accrued liabilities and accounts payable approximate carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company believes that its credit
facility approximates fair value since interest rates are adjusted to reflect current rates.      
   Prior to August 3, 2015, the Company was party to an amended and
restated credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent and swing line lender, and other lenders, dated as of April 29, 2011 (as amended and modified through August 3, 2015, the
Prior Credit Facility), consisting of up to $1,000,000 in aggregate commitments under a five-year asset-backed revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire on April 29, 2016.  
 On August 3, 2015, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (New Credit Agreement) with Bank of
America, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent and swing line lender, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto, under which the lenders committed to provide a five-year asset-backed revolving credit facility in an aggregate
committed principal amount of up to $700,000 (Revolving Credit Facility). On September 30, 2016, the Company amended the New Credit Agreement to provide for a new  first-in, last-out  revolving credit facility (the FILO Credit
Facility and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the New Credit Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50,000, which supplements availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company generally must draw down the FILO
Credit Facility before making any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.

  Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. are the joint lead arrangers for the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility replaced the Prior Credit Facility. Proceeds from the New Credit Facility are used for general corporate
purposes, including seasonal working capital needs.    The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the New
Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the inventory, accounts receivable and related assets of the borrowers under the New Credit Facility (collectively, the Loan Parties), but excluding the equity interests in
the Company and its subsidiaries, intellectual property, equipment and certain other property. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility are limited to a specified percentage of eligible collateral. The Company has the option to request an increase
in commitments under the New Credit Facility of up to $250,000, subject to certain restrictions.    Interest under the Revolving Credit
Facility accrues, at the election of the Company, at a LIBOR or alternate base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable interest rate margin, which is determined by reference to the level of excess availability under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Through the end of the fiscal quarter during which the closing of the Revolving Credit Facility occurred, loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.750% per annum, in the case of LIBOR borrowings, or at the
alternate base rate plus 0.750% per annum, in the alternative, and thereafter the interest rate began to fluctuate between LIBOR plus 2.000% per annum and LIBOR plus 1.500% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus
1.000% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 0.500% per annum), based upon the average daily availability under the Revolving Credit Facility for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. Interest under the FILO Credit Facility
accrues, at the election of the Company, at a LIBOR or alternate base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable interest rate margin, which is also determined by reference to the level of excess availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. Loans
under the FILO Credit Facility bear interest at 1.000% per annum more than loans under the Revolving Credit Facility.    The New Credit
Agreement contains customary negative covenants, which limit the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make investments, make restricted payments or specified payments and merge or acquire assets, among other things.
In addition, if excess availability under the New Credit Facility were to fall below certain specified levels, certain additional covenants (including fixed charge coverage ratio requirements) would be triggered, and the lenders would assume
dominion and control over the Loan Parties  cash.    The New Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including payment
defaults, material breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, default on other material indebtedness, customary ERISA events of default, bankruptcy and insolvency, material judgments, invalidity of liens on collateral, change of
control or cessation of business. The New Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative covenants and representations and warranties.  
 The Company wrote off $460 of deferred financing fees related to the Prior Credit Facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and the
remaining unamortized deferred financing fees of $3,542 were deferred and are being amortized over the five-year term of the New Credit Facility. The Company also incurred $5,701 of fees to secure the New Credit Facility, which are being amortized
over the five-year term accordingly. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company incurred $474 of fees to secure the FILO Credit Facility, which are being amortized over the same term as the New Credit Facility.  
 The Company had $191,423 and $192,000 of outstanding debt under the New Credit Facility as of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015,
respectively. The Company had $46,895 and $48,318 of outstanding letters of credit under its New Credit Facility as of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.

  Stock-Based Compensation       For the 13 and 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and
October 31, 2015, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses as follows:      
     
   On October 26, 2016, the Company entered into a release agreement
(the Release Agreement) with its former Chief Executive Officer, Ronald D. Boire. Under the Release Agreement, Mr. Boire and the Company agreed to release claims against each other in connection with Mr. Boire s termination of
employment in exchange for a cash payment contemplated by his employment agreement. In connection with the execution of the Release Agreement, Mr. Boire also agreed to forfeit all equity awards that were granted to him by the Company.  
 The cash payment in connection with the Release Agreement totals $4,826. The Company has previously recognized $1,933 in expense relating to
the equity awards granted to Mr. Boire during his employment. Taking into account the reversal of those expenses, the Company recorded a net charge related to the cash payment to Mr. Boire in connection with the Release Agreement of $2,892
within selling and administrative expenses during the second quarter ending October 29, 2016.

  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans       As of December 31, 1999,
substantially all employees of the Company were covered under a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the Pension Plan). As of January 1, 2000, the Pension Plan was amended so that employees no longer earn benefits for subsequent
service. Effective December 31, 2004, the Barnes   Noble.com Employees  Retirement Plan (the B N.com Retirement Plan) was merged with the Pension Plan. Substantially all employees of Barnes   Noble.com were covered
under the B N.com Retirement Plan. As of July 1, 2000, the B N.com Retirement Plan was amended so that employees no longer earn benefits for subsequent service. Subsequent service continued to be the basis for vesting of benefits not
yet vested at December 31, 1999 and June 30, 2000 for the Pension Plan and the B N.com Retirement Plan, respectively.    On
June 18, 2014, the Company s Board of Directors approved a resolution to terminate the Pension Plan. The Pension Plan termination was effective November 1, 2014 and the accrued benefit for active participants was vested as of such
date. As a result of the Pension Plan termination, pension liability and other comprehensive loss increased by $15,747, before tax, during the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2014. The pension liability was settled in either a lump-sum payment or a
purchased annuity. A special lump-sum opportunity was offered to the terminated vested participants in the Pension Plan during the 13 weeks ended November 1, 2014, which triggered settlement accounting in the period ended January 31,
2015. The settlement represented 735 participants who elected to receive a lump sum of their benefit, totaling $15,190. The distributions primarily took place in December 2014 and resulted in a settlement charge of $7,317, which was
reclassified from other comprehensive income to selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2015. In addition, the Pension Plan received a favorable determination letter, dated October 15, 2015, from the Internal Revenue Service. This
determination letter rules that the termination of the Pension Plan, as amended, does not affect its tax-qualified status.    The net impact
of the Pension Plan termination, special lump-sum opportunity, settlement accounting and remeasurement and regular plan experience, was an increase in pension liability of $3,062 and a decrease in other comprehensive income of $6,503, before tax, in
fiscal 2015.    In fiscal 2016, there was a final Pension Plan termination lump-sum opportunity offered to the remaining 2,300 active and
terminated vested participants at the final Pension Plan termination distribution date. To effectuate the full plan liquidation, lump-sum payments totaling approximately $18,100 were distributed in March 2016 to about 1,800 participants who elected
to receive an immediate distribution of their benefit as part of the plan termination lump-sum window. Benefits for the remaining plan population were transferred to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company for an annuity purchase premium of
$34,500, which was paid on March 28, 2016.

  Pension expense was $450 and $1,435 for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and
October 31, 2015, respectively, and $450 and $2,682 for the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. There were no pension liabilities recorded at October 29, 2016. Pension liabilities were $11,799 at
October 31, 2015 and recorded within accrued liabilities.    The Company maintains a defined contribution plan (the Savings Plan) for
the benefit of substantially all employees. Total Company contributions charged to employee benefit expenses for the Savings Plan were $2,774 and $2,661 for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively, and $6,161
and $6,173 for the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.

  Samsung Commercial Agreement       On June 4, 2014, NOOK Digital, LLC (NOOK Digital)
(formerly NOOK Media Sub and barnesandnoble.com llc), a wholly owned subsidiary of B N Education as of such date and a subsidiary of Barnes   Noble, entered into a commercial agreement (Agreement) with Samsung Electronics America, Inc.
(Samsung) relating to tablets.    Pursuant to the Agreement, NOOK Digital, after good faith consultations with Samsung and subject to
Samsung s agreement, selected Samsung tablet devices under development to be customized and co-branded by NOOK Digital. Such devices are produced by Samsung. The co-branded NOOK   
tablet devices are sold by NOOK Digital through Barnes   Noble retail stores, www.barnesandnoble.com and www.nook.com.   Under the
Agreement, NOOK Digital committed to purchase a minimum of 1,000,000 NOOK   -Samsung co-branded devices from Samsung within 12 months after the launch of the initial co-branded device, which
occurred on August 20, 2014. The 12-month period was automatically extended by three months due to the quantity of sales of such co-branded devices through December 31, 2014, and the period was further extended until June 30, 2016 by
an amendment executed by the parties on March 7, 2015.    NOOK Digital and Samsung have agreed to coordinate customer service for the
co-branded NOOK    devices and have both agreed to a license of intellectual property to promote and market the devices. Additionally, Samsung has agreed to fund a marketing fund for the
co-branded NOOK    devices at the initial launch and for the duration of the Agreement.  
 The Agreement had a two-year term, with certain termination rights, including termination (i) by NOOK Digital for a Samsung material
default; (ii) by Samsung for a NOOK Digital material default; (iii) by NOOK Digital if Samsung fails to meet its shipping and delivery obligations in any material respect on a timely basis; and (iv) by either party upon insolvency or
bankruptcy of the other party.    On May 17, 2016, NOOK Digital and Samsung amended the Agreement, pursuant to which NOOK Digital
agreed to a minimum purchase commitment during the first 12 months after launch of any co-branded NOOK    tablet device of total devices with a total retail value equal to $10,000. The amended
minimum purchase commitment replaces all prior purchase commitments contained in the Agreement by NOOK Digital and Samsung.

  Series J Preferred Stock       On August 18, 2011, the Company entered into an
investment agreement between the Company and Liberty GIC, Inc. (Liberty), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to Liberty, and Liberty purchased, 204,000 shares of the Company s Series J Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share
(Preferred Stock), for an aggregate purchase price of $204,000 in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act. The shares of Preferred Stock were convertible, at the option of the holders, into shares of Common
Stock representing 16.6% of the Common Stock outstanding as of August 29, 2011 (after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Preferred Stock) based on the initial conversion rate. The initial conversion rate reflected an initial
conversion price of $17.00 and was subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The initial dividend rate for the Preferred Stock was equal to 7.75% per annum of the initial liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock paid quarterly and
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.    On April 8, 2014, Liberty sold the majority of its shares to qualified institutional
buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and had retained an approximate 10% stake of its initial investment. As a result, Liberty no longer had the right to elect two preferred stock directors to the Company s Board.
Additionally, the consent rights and pre-emptive rights, to which Liberty was previously entitled, ceased to apply.    On June 5, 2015,
the Company entered into conversion agreements with five beneficial owners (Series J Holders) of its Preferred Stock, pursuant to which each of the Series J Holders had agreed to convert (Conversion) shares of Preferred Stock it beneficially owned
into shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (Company Common Stock), and additionally received a cash payment from the Company in connection with the Conversion.  
      20  

Table of Contents  

  On July 9, 2015, the Company completed the Conversion. Pursuant to the terms of the
Conversion Agreements, the Series J Holders converted an aggregate of 103,995 shares of Preferred Stock into 6,117,342 shares of Company Common Stock, and made an aggregate cash payment to the Series J Holders of $3,657 plus cash in lieu of
fractional shares in connection with the Conversion.    The number of shares of Company Common Stock issued was determined based on a
conversion ratio of 58.8235 shares of Company Common Stock per share of Preferred Stock converted, which was the conversion rate in the Certificate of the Designations with respect to the Preferred Stock, dated as of August 18, 2011.  
 On July 10, 2015, the Company gave notice of its exercise of the right to force conversion of all outstanding shares of its Senior
Convertible Redeemable Series J Preferred Stock into Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 9 of the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Relative Participating, Optional and Other Special Rights and Qualifications, Limitations and
Restrictions of Series J Preferred Stock, dated as of August 18, 2011 (the Forced Conversion). The effective date of the Forced Conversion was July 24, 2015. On the date of the Forced Conversion, each share of Series J Preferred
Stock was automatically converted into 59.8727 shares of Company Common Stock, which included shares of Company Common Stock reflecting accrued and unpaid dividends on Series J Preferred Stock. Each holder of Series J Preferred Stock received
whole shares of Company Common Stock and a cash amount in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock.    As a result of the
transactions described above, all shares of Series J Preferred Stock were retired by the Company and are no longer outstanding.

  Shareholders  Equity       On October 20, 2015, the Company s Board of
Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to $50,000 of its common shares. Stock repurchases under this program may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions from time to time and in such amounts as
management deems appropriate. The repurchase program has no expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company s repurchase plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the 13 and 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016, the Company repurchased 878,195 shares at a cost of $10,045 and 1,708,778 shares at a cost of $19,788, respectively, under this plan. The
Company had remaining capacity of approximately $3,494 under this program as of October 29, 2016. As of October 29, 2016, the Company has repurchased 39,741,262 shares at a cost of approximately $1,084,812 since the inception of the
Company s stock repurchase programs. The repurchased shares are held in treasury.      
   The Company is involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations
and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, including actions with respect to contracts, intellectual property, taxation, employment, benefits, securities, personal injuries and other matters. The results of
these proceedings in the ordinary course of business are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.  
 The Company records a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates, at least quarterly, developments in its legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and makes adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to
determine both probability and the estimated amount of a loss or potential loss. The Company may be unable to reasonably estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for a particular legal contingency for various reasons, including, among
others: (i) if the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) if proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) if there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending proceedings (including motions and appeals); (iv) if there is
uncertainty as to the likelihood of settlement and the outcome of any negotiations with respect thereto; (v) if there are significant factual issues to be determined or resolved; (vi) if the proceedings involve a large number of parties;
(vii) if relevant law is unsettled or novel or untested legal theories are presented; or (viii) if the proceedings are taking place in jurisdictions where the laws are complex or unclear. In such instances, there is considerable
uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss, if any.    Legal matters are inherently
unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company s control. As such, there can be no assurance that the final outcome of these matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company s
business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

  Except as otherwise described below with respect to the Adrea LLC (Adrea) matter, the Company has
determined that a loss is reasonably possible with respect to the matters described below. Based on its current knowledge, the Company has determined that the amount of loss or range of loss that is reasonably possible (or, in the case of Adrea,
probable), including any reasonably possible (or, in the case of Adrea, probable) losses in excess of amounts already accrued, is not estimable.  
 The following is a discussion of the material legal matters involving the Company.  
   PIN Pad Litigation    
 As previously disclosed, the Company discovered that PIN pads in certain of its stores had been tampered with to allow criminal access to card
data and PIN numbers on credit and debit cards swiped through the terminals. Following public disclosure of this matter on October 24, 2012, the Company was served with four putative class action complaints (three in federal district court
in the Northern District of Illinois and one in the Northern District of California), each of which alleged on behalf of national and other classes of customers who swiped credit and debit cards in Barnes   Noble Retail stores common law
claims such as negligence, breach of contract and invasion of privacy, as well as statutory claims such as violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, state data breach notification statutes, and state unfair and deceptive practices
statutes. The actions sought various forms of relief including damages, injunctive or equitable relief, multiple or punitive damages, attorneys  fees, costs, and interest. All four cases were transferred and/or assigned to a single
judge in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and a single consolidated amended complaint was filed. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint in its entirety, and in September
2013, the Court granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice. The Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint, and the Company filed a second motion to dismiss. On October 3, 2016, the Court granted the second motion to dismiss, and
dismissed the case without prejudice; in doing so, the Court permitted plaintiffs to file a second amended complaint by October 31, 2016. On October 31, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The Court set the
following schedule; motion to dismiss brief due on November 30, 2016, opposition brief due January 6, 2017, and reply brief due January 31, 2017. A status hearing is scheduled for March 14, 2017.  
   Cassandra Carag individually and on behalf of others similarly situated v. Barnes   Noble, Inc., Barnes   Noble
Booksellers, Inc. and DOES 1 through 100 inclusive      On November 27, 2013, former Associate Store Manager Cassandra Carag
(Carag) brought suit in Sacramento County Superior Court, asserting claims on behalf of herself and all other hourly (non-exempt) Barnes   Noble employees in California in the preceding four years for unpaid regular and overtime wages based
on alleged off-the-clock work, penalties and pay based on missed meal and rest breaks, and for improper wage statements, payroll records, and untimely pay at separation as a result of the alleged pay errors during employment. Via the complaint,
Carag seeks to recover unpaid wages and statutory penalties for all hourly Barnes   Noble employees within California from November 27, 2009 to present. On February 13, 2014, the Company filed an Answer in the state court and
concurrently requested removal of the action to federal court. On May 30, 2014, the federal court granted Plaintiff s motion to remand the case to state court and denied Plaintiff s motion to strike portions of the Answer to the
Complaint (referring the latter motion to the lower court for future consideration).      Adrea LLC v. Barnes   Noble, Inc.,
barnesandnoble.com llc and NOOK Media LLC      With respect to the Adrea matter described herein, the Company has determined, based on
its current knowledge, that a loss is probable. On June 14, 2013, Adrea filed a complaint against Barnes   Noble, Inc., NOOK Digital, LLC (formerly barnesandnoble.com llc) and B N Education, LLC (formerly NOOK Media LLC)
(collectively, B N) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that various B N NOOK products and related online services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,298,851 ( 851 patent), 7,299,501 ( 501
patent) and 7,620,703 ( 703 patent). B N filed its Answer on August 9, 2013, denying infringement and asserting several affirmative defenses. At the same time, B N filed counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments of
non-infringement and invalidity with respect to each of the patents-in-suit. On July 1, 2014, the Court issued a decision granting partial summary judgment in B N s favor, and in particular granting B N s motion to dismiss one
of Adrea s infringement claims, and granting B N s motion to limit any damages award with respect to another of Adrea s infringement claims.  
 Beginning October 7, 2014, through and including October 22, 2014, the case was tried to a jury in the Southern District of New
York. The jury returned its verdict on October 27, 2014. The jury found no infringement with respect to the  851 patent, and infringement with respect to the  501 and  703 patents. It awarded damages in the amount of $1,330. The
jury further found no willful infringement with respect to any patent.    On July 24, 2015, the Court granted B N s post-trial
application to invalidate one of the two patents (the  501 patent) the jury found to have been infringed. On September 28, 2015, the Court heard post-trial motions on the jury s infringement

and validity determinations, and on February 24, 2016, it issued a decision upholding the jury s determination of infringement and validity with respect to the  703 patent. Since
the original damages award was a total award for infringement of both patents, the Court held a new trial to determine damages for infringement of the  703 patent, which trial concluded on July 15, 2016. In a post-trial brief, Adrea asked
the Court to award damages of $1,059 for infringement of the  703 patent alone (calculated by applying a 20.2 cent per unit royalty rate to accused sales for the period November 2009, when the  703 patent first issued, through
June 30, 2014), and requested enhanced damages. B N responded to Adrea s damages claims, asking the Court to award damages of $105 for infringement of the  703 patent (calculated by applying a 0.2 cent per unit royalty rate
to accused sales for the period November 2009 through the date of the first trial verdict, October 22, 2014), and further responded that no enhanced damages were available as a matter of law. Adrea filed its replies to B N s
submissions on September 8, 2016.     Caf  Manager Class Actions    
 Two former Caf  Managers have filed separate actions alleging similar claims of entitlement to unpaid compensation for
overtime. In each action, the plaintiff seeks to represent a class of allegedly similarly situated employees who performed the same position (Caf  Manager). Specifically, Christine Hartpence filed a complaint against Barnes  
Noble, Inc. (Barnes   Noble) in Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas on May 26, 2015 (Case No.: 160503426), alleging that she is entitled to unpaid compensation for overtime under Pennsylvania law and seeking to represent a class
of allegedly similarly situated employees who performed the same position (Caf  Manager). On July 14, 2016, Ms. Hartpence amended her complaint to assert a purported collective action for alleged unpaid overtime compensation under
the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), by which she sought to act as a class representative for similarly situated Caf  Managers throughout the United States. On July 27, 2016, Barnes   Noble removed the case to the U.S.
District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Case No.: 16-4034). Ms. Hartpence then voluntarily dismissed her complaint and subsequently re-filed a similar complaint in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas (Case No.:
161003213), where it is currently pending. The re-filed complaint alleges only claims of unpaid overtime under Pennsylvania law and alleges class claims under Pennsylvania law that are limited to current and former Caf  Managers within
Pennsylvania.   On September 20, 2016, Kelly Brown filed a complaint against Barnes   Noble in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York (Case No.: 16-7333) in which she also alleges that she is entitled to unpaid compensation under the FLSA and Illinois law. Ms. Brown seeks to represent a national class of all similarly situated
Caf  Managers under the FLSA, as well as an Illinois-based class under Illinois law. On November 9, 2016, Ms. Brown filed an amended complaint to add an additional plaintiff named Tiffany Stewart, who is a former Caf 
Manager who also alleges unpaid overtime compensation in violation of New York law and seeks to represent a class of similarly situated New York-based Caf  Managers under New York law.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements       In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,
 Income Taxes (Topic 740)   Intra- Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  (ASU 2016-16). This standard requires that an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than
inventory when the transfer occurs. Consequently, the amendments in this standard eliminate the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. The amendments in this standard do not include new disclosure requirements;
however, existing disclosure requirements might be applicable. ASU 2016-16 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting
periods. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.    In August
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  (ASU 2016-15). The amendments in this update clarifies the classification of certain cash receipts and
cash payments in the statement of cash flows, including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of contingent consideration arising from a business combination, insurance settlement proceeds, and distributions from certain equity method
investees. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard
on its consolidated financial statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic
718)   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 includes provisions to simplify certain aspects related to the accounting for share-based awards and the related financial statement presentation.
This ASU includes a requirement that the tax effect related to the settlement of share-based awards be recorded in income tax benefit or expense in the statements of earnings. This change is required to be adopted prospectively in the period of
adoption. In addition, the ASU modifies the classification of certain share-based payment activities within the statements of cash flows and these changes are required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, or in certain cases
prospectively, beginning in the period of adoption. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  (ASU 2016-02), in order
to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. ASU
2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 requires
expanded disclosures about the nature and terms of lease agreements and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements, but expects that it will result in a significant increase to its long-term assets and liabilities.  
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  (ASU 2015-11), modifying the accounting for
inventory. Under ASU 2015-11, the measurement principle for inventory will change from lower of cost or market value to lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is applicable to inventory that is accounted for under the first-in, first-out method and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In June 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-10,  Technical Corrections and Improvements . The amendments in this update cover a wide range of
Topics in the Codification. The amendments in this update represent changes to make minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant
administrative cost to most entities. This update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2014-240,  Technical Corrections and Improvements , which has been deleted. The adoption did not have a material effect on the
Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  (ASU 2015-03). ASU 2015-03 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by ASU 2015-03. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-15,  Presentation and
Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  (ASU 2015-15). ASU 2015-15 clarifies the presentation and measuring of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements given
the lack of guidance on this topic in ASU 2015-03. For line-of-credit arrangements, an entity can continue to present debt issuance costs as an asset and amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit
arrangement. ASU 2015-03, as amended, is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within such annual reporting periods with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-03 is to be
retrospectively adopted to each prior reporting period presented. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter ended July 30, 2016. The Company made a policy election to continue recording the debt issuance costs as an asset, as allowed
for revolving credit agreements. As the Company only has a line-of-credit arrangement, the adoption of this ASU did not result in a change in the Company s accounting for debt issuance costs related to such line of credit and had no impact on
the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09. The standard provides companies with a
single model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The core principle of the model is to recognize revenue when
control of the goods or services transfers to the customer, as opposed to recognizing revenue when the risks and rewards transfer to the customer under the existing revenue guidance. ASU 2014-09, as amended by ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10
and ASU 2016-12, is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016. The guidance permits companies to either apply the requirements retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment. The Company has not yet
selected a transition method nor has it determined the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

Item 2:   
   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations      
    Separation of Barnes   Noble Education, Inc.     
 On February 26, 2015, Barnes   Noble announced plans for the legal and structural separation of Barnes   Noble
Education, Inc. (Barnes   Noble Education or B N Education) (formerly known as NOOK Media Inc.) from Barnes   Noble into an independent public company (the Spin-Off).  
 On July 14, 2015, the Barnes   Noble board of directors (the Board) approved the final distribution ratio and declared a pro
rata dividend of the outstanding shares of B N Education common stock, which resulted in the complete legal and structural separation of the two companies. The distribution was subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as set
forth in B N Education s Registration Statement on Form S-1, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 26, 2015 and was amended on April 29, 2015, June 4, 2015, June 29,
2015, July 13, 2015, July 14, 2015 and July 15, 2015.    On August 2, 2015, Barnes   Noble completed
the Spin-Off of Barnes   Noble Education and distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of B N Education common stock to the Company s stockholders of record as of July 27, 2015. These Barnes   Noble
stockholders of record as of July 27, 2015 received a distribution of 0.632 shares of B N Education common stock for each share of Barnes   Noble common stock held as of the record date. Immediately following the completion of the
Spin-Off, the Company s stockholders owned 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of B N Education. Following the Spin-Off, B N Education operates as an independent public company and as the parent of Barnes   Noble
College, trading on New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol  BNED .    In connection with the separation of B N
Education, the Company and B N Education entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement on July 14, 2015 and several other ancillary agreements on August 2, 2015. These agreements govern the relationship between the Company and
B N Education after the separation and allocate between the Company and B N Education various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations following the separation, including employee benefits, intellectual property, information technology,
insurance and tax-related assets and liabilities. The agreements also describe the Company s future commitments to provide B N Education with certain transition services.  
 This Spin-Off is expected to be a non-taxable event for Barnes   Noble and its shareholders, and Barnes   Noble s U.S.
shareholders (other than those subject to special rules) generally will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the distribution of B N Education shares.  
    History of Barnes   Noble Education, Inc.     
 On September 30, 2009, Barnes   Noble acquired Barnes   Noble College Booksellers, LLC (B N College) from Leonard
and Louise Riggio. From that date until October 4, 2012, B N College was wholly owned by Barnes   Noble Booksellers, Inc. B N Education was initially incorporated under the name NOOK Media Inc. in July 2012 to hold
Barnes   Noble s B N College and NOOK digital businesses. On October 4, 2012, Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) acquired a 17.6% non-controlling preferred membership interest in B N Education s subsidiary B N
Education, LLC (formerly NOOK Media LLC) (the LLC), and through B N Education, Barnes   Noble maintained an 82.4% controlling interest of the B N College and NOOK digital businesses.  
 On January 22, 2013, Pearson Education, Inc. (Pearson) acquired a 5% non-controlling preferred membership interest in the LLC, entered
into a commercial agreement with the LLC relating to the B N College business and received warrants to purchase an additional preferred membership interest in the LLC.  
 On December 4, 2014, B N Education re-acquired Microsoft s interest in the LLC in exchange for cash and common stock of
Barnes   Noble and the Microsoft commercial agreement was terminated effective as of such date. On December 22, 2014, B N Education also re-acquired Pearson s interest in the LLC and certain related warrants previously issued
to Pearson. In connection with these transactions, Barnes   Noble entered into contingent payment agreements with Microsoft and Pearson providing for additional payments upon the occurrence of certain events, including upon a sale of the
NOOK digital business. As a result of these transactions, Barnes   Noble owned, prior to the Spin-Off, 100% of B N Education.  
 On May 1, 2015, B N Education distributed to Barnes   Noble all of the membership interests in B N Education s NOOK
digital business. As a result, B N Education ceased to own any interest in the NOOK digital business, which remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Barnes   Noble.

     Discontinued Operations of Barnes   Noble Education, Inc.     
 The Company has recognized the separation of B N Education in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-20,
 Discontinued Operations . As such, the historical results of Barnes   Noble Education have been adjusted to include separation-related costs and exclude corporate allocations with B N Retail and have been classified as
discontinued operations.    Discontinued operations in the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015 primarily consisted of investment banking
fees (as it directly related to the Spin-Off) and separation-related costs.    Discontinued operations in the 26 weeks ended
October 31, 2015 primarily consisted of pre-spin B N Education results, investment banking fees (as it directly related to the Spin-Off), separation-related costs and excluded corporate allocation adjustments with B N Retail.  
    Liquidity and Capital Resources     
 The primary sources of Barnes   Noble s cash are net cash flows from operating activities, funds available under its credit
facility and short-term vendor financing.     Credit Facility   
 Prior to August 3, 2015, the Company was party to an amended and restated credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative
agent, collateral agent and swing line lender, and other lenders, dated as of April 29, 2011 (as amended and modified through August 3, 2015, the Prior Credit Facility), consisting of up to $1.0 billion in aggregate
commitments under a five-year asset-backed revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire on April 29, 2016.    On
August 3, 2015, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (New Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent and swing line lender, and the other lenders from time to
time party thereto, under which the lenders committed to provide a five-year asset-backed revolving credit facility in an aggregate committed principal amount of up to $700.0 million (Revolving Credit Facility). On September 30, 2016, the
Company amended the New Credit Agreement to provide for a new  first-in, last-out  revolving credit facility (the FILO Credit Facility and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the New Credit Facility) in an aggregate principal
amount of up to $50.0 million, which supplements availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company generally must draw down the FILO Credit Facility before making any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
 Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and SunTrust Robinson
Humphrey, Inc. are the joint lead arrangers for the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility replaced the Prior Credit Facility. Proceeds from the New Credit Facility are used for general corporate purposes, including seasonal working capital
needs.    The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility is
secured by substantially all of the inventory, accounts receivable and related assets of the borrowers under the New Credit Facility (collectively, the Loan Parties), but excluding the equity interests in the Company and its subsidiaries,
intellectual property, equipment and certain other property. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility are limited to a specified percentage of eligible collateral. The Company has the option to request an increase in commitments under the New Credit
Facility of up to $250.0 million, subject to certain restrictions.    Interest under the Revolving Credit Facility accrues, at the election
of the Company, at a LIBOR or alternate base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable interest rate margin, which is determined by reference to the level of excess availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. Through the end of the fiscal
quarter during which the closing of the Revolving Credit Facility occurred, loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.750% per annum, in the case of LIBOR borrowings, or at the alternate base rate plus
0.750% per annum, in the alternative, and thereafter the interest rate began to fluctuate between LIBOR plus 2.000% per annum and LIBOR plus 1.500% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 1.000% per annum and the
alternate base rate plus 0.500% per annum), based upon the average daily availability under the Revolving Credit Facility for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. Interest under the FILO Credit Facility accrues, at the election of the
Company, at a LIBOR or alternate base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable interest rate margin, which is also determined by reference to the level of excess availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. Loans under the FILO Credit Facility
bear interest at 1.000% per annum more than loans under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
      26  

Table of Contents  

  The New Credit Agreement contains customary negative covenants, which limit the Company s
ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make investments, make restricted payments or specified payments and merge or acquire assets, among other things. In addition, if excess availability under the New Credit Facility were to fall
below certain specified levels, certain additional covenants (including fixed charge coverage ratio requirements) would be triggered, and the lenders would assume dominion and control over the Loan Parties  cash.  
 The New Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, material breaches of representations and
warranties, covenant defaults, default on other material indebtedness, customary ERISA events of default, bankruptcy and insolvency, material judgments, invalidity of liens on collateral, change of control or cessation of business. The New Credit
Agreement also contains customary affirmative covenants and representations and warranties.    The Company wrote off $0.5 million of
deferred financing fees related to the Prior Credit Facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and the remaining unamortized deferred financing fees of $3.5 million were deferred and are being amortized over the five-year term of the New
Credit Facility. The Company also incurred $5.7 million of fees to secure the New Credit Facility, which are being amortized over the five-year term accordingly. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company incurred $0.5 million of fees to secure
the FILO Credit Facility, which are being amortized over the same term as the New Credit Facility.    The Company had $191.4 million and
$192.0 million of outstanding debt under the New Credit Facility as of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. The Company had $46.9 million and $48.3 million of outstanding letters of credit under its New Credit Facility as
of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.     Cash Flows   
 The Company s cash and cash equivalents were $11.4 million as of October 29, 2016, compared with $13.4 million as of October 31,
2015. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $2.0 million versus the prior year period were due to changes in working capital and cash flows as outlined below.  
 Net cash flows used in operating activities for the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 were $51.8 million, as compared to net cash flows
used in operating activities of $43.7 million for the 26 weeks ended October 31, 2015. The unfavorable year-over-year comparison was primarily attributable to changes in working capital.  
 Net cash flows used in investing activities for the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 were $51.7 million, as compared to net cash flows
used in investing activities of $50.7 million for the 26 weeks ended October 31, 2015. The Company s investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures for the maintenance of existing stores, merchandising initiatives and
enhancements to systems and the website.    Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016
were $101.0 million, as compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $147.6 million for the 26 weeks ended October 31, 2015. The Company s financing activities during the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 consisted
primarily of net proceeds from the credit facility, offset by common dividends and share repurchases. Financing activities during the 26 weeks ended October 31, 2015 consisted primarily of net proceeds from the credit facility, offset by common
and preferred dividends, cash settlement of an equity award, fees incurred to enter into the New Credit Facility and an inducement fee on the conversion of preferred stock.  
 Since July 2015, the Company has returned $114.7 million in cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  
 Additional year-over-year balance sheet changes include the following:

Table of Contents  

Accrued liabilities decreased $14.2 million, or 4.4%, to $311.2 million as of October 29, 2016, compared to $325.4 million as of October 31, 2015. Accrued liabilities include the eBook settlement, deferred
income, compensation, occupancy related, legal and other selling and administrative miscellaneous accruals.        

Gift card liabilities increased $13.6 million, or 4.1%, to $344.0 million as of October 29, 2016, compared to $330.5 million as of October 31, 2015. This increase was due to the activation of gift cards in
connection with the eBook settlement. The Company estimates the portion of the gift card liability for which the likelihood of redemption is remote based upon the Company s historical redemption patterns. The Company recognized gift card
breakage of $4.8 million and $5.2 million during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively, and $9.8 million and $10.6 million during the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015,
respectively. Additional breakage may be required if gift card redemptions continue to run lower than historical patterns.        
     
   The Company has arrangements with third-party manufacturers to produce certain NOOK    products. These manufacturers procure and assemble unfinished parts and components from third-party suppliers based on forecasts provided by the Company. Given production lead times, commitments
are generally made far in advance of finished product delivery. Based on current purchase commitments and product development plans, the Company did not record any provision for purchase commitments. Future charges may be required based on changes
in forecasted sales or strategic direction.     EBook Settlement   
 The Company provided credits to eligible customers resulting from the settlement reached with Apple Inc. (Apple) in an antitrust lawsuit filed
by various State Attorneys General and private class plaintiffs regarding the price of digital books. The Company s customers were entitled to $95.7 million in total credits as a result of the settlement, which is funded by Apple. If a
customer s credit is not used to make a purchase within one year, the entire credit will expire. The Company recorded estimated redemptions of $56.5 million during fiscal 2016 as a receivable from Apple settlement fund and a liability to its
customers with a deadline of June 2017 for the activation of all credits. As of October 29, 2016, the Company s customers had activated $50.6 million in credits, of which $39.8 million were redeemed. Total receivables from the Apple
settlement fund were $7.6 million as of October 29, 2016.     Samsung Agreement   
 On June 4, 2014, NOOK Digital, LLC (NOOK Digital) (formerly NOOK Media Sub and barnesandnoble.com llc), a wholly owned subsidiary of
B N Education as of such date and a subsidiary of Barnes   Noble, entered into a commercial agreement (Agreement) with Samsung Electronics America, Inc. (Samsung) relating to tablets.  
 Pursuant to the Agreement, NOOK Digital, after good faith consultations with Samsung and subject to Samsung s agreement, selected Samsung
tablet devices under development to be customized and co-branded by NOOK Digital. Such devices are produced by Samsung. The co-branded NOOK    tablet devices are sold by NOOK Digital
through Barnes   Noble retail stores, www.barnesandnoble.com and www.nook.com.   Under the Agreement, NOOK Digital committed to
purchase a minimum of 1,000,000 NOOK   -Samsung co-branded devices from Samsung within 12 months after the launch of the initial co-branded device, which occurred on August 20, 2014. The
12-month period was automatically extended by three months due to the quantity of sales of such co-branded devices through December 31, 2014, and the period was further extended until June 30, 2016 by an amendment executed by the parties
on March 7, 2015.  
      28  

Table of Contents  

  NOOK Digital and Samsung have agreed to coordinate customer service for the co-branded NOOK    devices and have both agreed to a license of intellectual property to promote and market the devices. Additionally, Samsung has agreed to fund a marketing fund for the co-branded NOOK    devices at the initial launch and for the duration of the Agreement.    The Agreement
had a two-year term, with certain termination rights, including termination (i) by NOOK Digital for a Samsung material default; (ii) by Samsung for a NOOK Digital material default; (iii) by NOOK Digital if Samsung fails to meet its
shipping and delivery obligations in any material respect on a timely basis; and (iv) by either party upon insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.  
 On May 17, 2016, NOOK Digital and Samsung amended the Agreement, pursuant to which NOOK Digital agreed to a minimum purchase commitment
during the first 12 months after launch of any co-branded NOOK    tablet device of total devices with a total retail value equal to $10.0 million. The amended minimum purchase commitment
replaces all prior purchase commitments contained in the Agreement by NOOK Digital and Samsung.     Series J Preferred Stock   
 On August 18, 2011, the Company entered into an investment agreement between the Company and Liberty GIC, Inc. (Liberty), pursuant to
which the Company issued and sold to Liberty, and Liberty purchased, 204,000 shares of the Company s Series J Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (Preferred Stock), for an aggregate purchase price of $204.0 million in a private
placement exempt from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act. The shares of Preferred Stock were convertible, at the option of the holders, into shares of Common Stock representing 16.6% of the Common Stock outstanding as of August 29,
2011 (after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Preferred Stock) based on the initial conversion rate. The initial conversion rate reflected an initial conversion price of $17.00 and was subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The
initial dividend rate for the Preferred Stock was equal to 7.75% per annum of the initial liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock paid quarterly and subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.  
 On April 8, 2014, Liberty sold the majority of its shares to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities
Act and had retained an approximate 10% stake of its initial investment. As a result, Liberty no longer had the right to elect two preferred stock directors to the Company s Board. Additionally, the consent rights and pre-emptive rights, to
which Liberty was previously entitled, ceased to apply.    On June 5, 2015, the Company entered into conversion agreements with five
beneficial owners (Series J Holders) of its Preferred Stock, pursuant to which each of the Series J Holders had agreed to convert (Conversion) shares of Preferred Stock it beneficially owned into shares of the Company s common stock, par value
$0.001 per share (Company Common Stock), and additionally received a cash payment from the Company in connection with the Conversion.    On
July 9, 2015, the Company completed the Conversion. Pursuant to the terms of the Conversion Agreements, the Series J Holders converted an aggregate of 103,995 shares of Preferred Stock into 6,117,342 shares of Company Common Stock, and made an
aggregate cash payment to the Series J Holders of $3.7 million plus cash in lieu of fractional shares in connection with the Conversion.  
 On July 10, 2015, the Company gave notice of its exercise of the right to force conversion of all outstanding shares of its Senior
Convertible Redeemable Series J Preferred Stock into Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 9 of the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Relative Participating, Optional and Other Special Rights and Qualifications, Limitations and
Restrictions of Series J Preferred Stock, dated as of August 18, 2011 (the Forced Conversion). The effective date of the Forced Conversion was July 24, 2015. On the date of the Forced Conversion, each share of Series J Preferred
Stock was automatically converted into 59.8727 shares of Company Common Stock, which included shares of Company Common Stock reflecting accrued and unpaid dividends on Series J Preferred Stock. Each holder of Series J Preferred Stock received
whole shares of Company Common Stock and a cash amount in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock.    As a result of the
transactions described above, all shares of Series J Preferred Stock were retired by the Company and are no longer outstanding.    Based
upon the Company s current operating levels and capital expenditures for fiscal 2017, management believes cash and cash equivalents on hand, funds available under its credit facility and short-term vendor financing will be sufficient to meet
the Company s normal working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next 12 months. The Company regularly evaluates its capital structure and conditions in the financing markets to ensure it maintains adequate flexibility to
successfully execute its business plan.

     Segments     
 The Company identifies its operating segments based on the way the business is managed (focusing on the financial information distributed) and
the manner in which the chief operating decision maker interacts with other members of management and makes decisions on the allocation of resources. The Company s two operating segments are B N Retail and NOOK.  
    Seasonality       The B N
Retail business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating income realized during its third fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season.  
 The NOOK business, like that of many technology companies, is impacted by the launch of new products and the promotional efforts to support
those new products, as well as the traditional retail holiday selling seasonality.       Business Overview      
 In recent years, Barnes   Noble has experienced declining sales trends due to lower comparable store sales, decreased online and
digital sales, and store closures. The Company also experienced expense deleverage as a result of the declining sales trends. To combat these trends, the Company has implemented a number of merchandising initiatives to improve traffic and
conversion. These initiatives include increasing the size and scope of its in-store events, which now include nationwide campaigns, such as Get Pop-Cultured and Maker Faire that increase traffic and sales and further reinforce Barnes  
Noble as a community center. The Company is also improving the navigation and discovery of titles that takes place in its stores to make books easier to find amongst its vast selection, which it believes will improve performance. 
 Since launching its new website in June 2015, the Company has implemented a number of website fixes to address post-launch issues that reduced
website traffic and conversion, as well as to improve the overall user experience. BN.com is an important component of the Company s omni-channel strategy, and it believes that in the long term, the new platform will enable it to be more
competitive in the marketplace.    Through its omni-channel offering, the Company believes that it is well positioned to improve results and
is focused on executing four key objectives to achieve success, including: significantly reducing NOOK losses; growing online and bookstore sales; reducing B N Retail s cost structure; and growing its Membership program.  
 The Company has taken a number of actions that will help further reduce NOOK losses, including the exit of its Apps and Video businesses, as
well as the exit of the U.K. eBook market. Additionally, the Company outsourced certain NOOK functions, including cloud management and development support for NOOK    software, which enabled it
to close its Santa Clara, CA and Taipei offices. The Company continues to bring new co-branded devices to market through its partnership with Samsung.  
 To grow online and bookstore sales, the Company will utilize the strong Barnes   Noble brand and retail footprint to attract
customers to its omni-channel offerings. The Company has created individual bookstore social media accounts, which enable its booksellers to communicate directly with customers at the local level to inform them of all the great events and
merchandise available at their local Barnes   Noble stores. The Company is also focused on increasing traffic through store events, and conversion through improved navigation and discovery throughout the store, including a customer friendly
and more intuitive organization of books and improved signage for easier browsing within and across sections.    To reduce B N
Retail s cost structure, the Company plans to increase productivity, streamline back office operations and eliminate non-productive spend.  
 The Company s Membership program provides the Company with valuable data and insights into its customer base, enabling the Company to
have deeper relationships and more meaningful communications with its Members. The Company plans to leverage its unique assets to increase the appeal of the program and the loyalty of its Members.

   During the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, the Company s sales decreased $36.1 million, or 4.0%, to $858.5 million
from $894.7 million during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. The changes by segment are as follows:      

B N Retail sales for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 decreased $30.0 million, or 3.5%, to $830.7 million from $860.7 million during the same period one year ago, and accounted for 96.8% of total Company
sales. Comparable store sales decreased $23.7 million, or 3.2%, as compared to the prior year. Closed stores decreased sales by $11.0 million. B N Retail also includes third-party sales of Sterling Publishing Co., Inc., which decreased by
$3.3 million, or 23.1%, versus the prior year on lower coloring book sales. Online sales increased $7.8 million, or 12.5%, versus the prior year period on benefits from the eBook settlement, site improvements and increased promotional activity.
     Of the $23.7 million decrease in comparable store sales, core comparable store sales, which exclude sales of NOOK    products, decreased $20.1 million, or 2.8%, as compared to the prior year due primarily to lower traffic. Book categories decreased sales by $14.4 million, or 3.0%, due primarily to declines in
Trade book and Bargain sales (primarily coloring books), partially offset by higher Juvenile sales ( Harry Potter and the Cursed Child ). Non-book core categories decreased sales by $5.7 million, or 2.4%, for the quarter as declines in the
Newsstand, DVD and Caf  businesses were partially mitigated by increases in Toys   Games and Gift products. Comparable sales of NOOK    products at B N Retail stores
decreased $3.6 million, or 31.9%, primarily on lower device unit volume and lower average selling prices.

sales.      During the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, B N Retail had no store openings and no store closings.

  Of the $72.4 million decrease in comparable store sales, core comparable store sales, which
exclude sales of NOOK    products, decreased $61.5 million, or 4.0%, as compared to the prior year due in large part to lower traffic and the challenging retail environment. Book categories
decreased sales by $53.0 million, or 5.1%, on lower sales of Trade and Bargain titles (primarily coloring books), partially offset by higher Juvenile sales ( Harry Potter and the Cursed Child ). Non-book core categories decreased sales by $8.5
million, or 1.7%, as declines in DVD, Newsstand and Caf  businesses were partially mitigated by increases in Toys   Games and Gift products. Comparable sales of NOOK    products
at B N Retail stores decreased $10.9 million, or 39.5%, primarily on lower device unit volume.      

Elimination sales, which represent sales from NOOK to B N Retail on a sell-through basis, decreased $8.2 million, or 33.8%, versus the prior year. NOOK sales, net of elimination, accounted for 3.4% of total Company
sales.      During the 26 weeks ended October 29, 2016, B N Retail had no store openings and two store closings.

   The Company s cost of sales and occupancy includes costs such as merchandise costs, distribution center costs (including
payroll, freight, supplies, depreciation and other operating expenses), rental expense, common area maintenance and real estate taxes, partially offset by landlord tenant allowances amortized over the life of the lease.  
 During the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, cost of sales and occupancy decreased $21.7 million, or 3.5%, to $603.2 million from $624.9 million during

Child  (90 basis points), occupancy deleverage (40 basis points) and lower eCommerce margins on higher promotional activity to increase site traffic (25 basis points), partially offset by timing of vendor settlements (55 basis points). The
remaining variance was comprised of product mix and general timing differences.        

NOOK cost of sales and occupancy decreased as a percentage of sales to 53.1% from 61.9% during the same period one year ago. This decrease was primarily due to sales mix.

The remaining variance was attributable to product mix and general timing differences.        

NOOK cost of sales and occupancy decreased as a percentage of sales to 53.1% from 64.3% during the same period one year ago. This decrease was primarily due to sales mix, improved device margins and a favorable channel
partner settlement.       Gross Profit       
   The Company s consolidated gross profit decreased $14.4 million, or 5.3%, to $255.4 million during the 13 weeks ended
October 29, 2016 from $269.8 million during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. This decrease was due to the matters discussed above.    The

are as follows:      

B N Retail selling and administrative expenses decreased $17.0 million as compared to prior year, or 100 basis points as a percentage of sales to 28.3% from 29.3% for the quarter. This decrease was primarily due to
a prior year separation-related net severance charge of $10.5 million (120 basis points).      Favorable variances to the prior
year also include lower website expenses (25 basis points), as the prior year included fixes to stabilize the site and improve traffic and customer experience, and lower pension expense (10 basis points) on the prior year plan termination. The
current year includes a severance charge net of reversal of expense relating to equity awards of $3.0 million resulting from the CEO departure (35 basis points) (see Note 18 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Unfavorable variances to the prior
year also include increased severance costs (30 basis points) primarily resulting from a cost reduction program, and higher store payroll (10 basis points on store sales) as sales deleverage and wage increases offset productivity gains. The
remaining variance was attributable to expense deleverage and the general timing of expenses.      

NOOK selling and administrative expenses decreased $18.7 million as compared to prior year, decreasing as a percentage of sales to 68.9% from 111.5% for the quarter. This decrease was primarily due to continued cost
rationalization efforts, including lower compensation and lower severance, as well as lower variable costs on the sales decline.

separation-related net severance charge of $10.5 million (60 basis points). Favorable variances to the prior year also include lower pension expense (10 basis points) on the prior year plan termination. The remaining variance was attributable to

critical accounting policies. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  found in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 for
additional information relating to the Company s use of estimates and other critical accounting policies.       Disclosure Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements       This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements (within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and information relating to Barnes   Noble that are based on the beliefs of the management of
Barnes   Noble as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to the management of Barnes   Noble. When used in this communication, the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate, 
 expect,   intend,   plan,   will,   forecasts,   projections,  and similar expressions, as they relate to Barnes   Noble or the management of Barnes   Noble,
identify forward-looking statements.    Such statements reflect the current views of Barnes   Noble with respect to future events,
the outcome of which is subject to certain risks, including, among others, the general economic environment and consumer spending patterns, decreased consumer demand for Barnes   Noble s products, low growth or declining sales and net
income due to various factors, including store closings, higher-than-anticipated or increasing costs, including with respect to store closings, relocation, occupancy (including in connection with lease renewals) and labor costs, the effects of
competition, the risk of insufficient access to financing to implement future business initiatives, risks associated with data privacy and information security, risks associated with Barnes   Noble s supply chain, including possible
delays and disruptions and increases in shipping rates, various risks associated with the digital business, including the possible loss of customers, declines in digital content sales, risks and costs associated with ongoing

efforts to rationalize the digital business and the digital business not being able to perform its obligations under the Samsung commercial agreement and the consequences thereof, the risk that
financial and operational forecasts and projections are not achieved, the performance of Barnes   Noble s initiatives including but not limited to its new store concept and eCommerce initiatives, unanticipated adverse litigation
results or effects, potential infringement of Barnes   Noble s intellectual property by third parties or by Barnes   Noble of the intellectual property of third parties, and other factors, including those factors discussed in
detail in Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  in Barnes   Noble s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, and in Barnes   Noble s other filings made hereafter from time to time with
the SEC.    Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results
or outcomes may vary materially from those described as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or planned. Subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Barnes   Noble or persons acting on its behalf
are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph. Barnes   Noble undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise after the date of this Form 10-Q.      

Item 3:   
   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk        The Company limits
its interest rate risks by investing certain of its excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with an original maturity of one year or less. The Company does not expect any material losses from its invested cash balances and the
Company believes that its interest rate exposure is modest. As of October 29, 2016, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $11.4 million. A 50 basis point increase in annual interest rates would have increased the
Company s interest income by $0.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in annual interest rates would have reduced interest income by $0.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  
 Additionally, the Company may from time to time borrow money under its credit facility at various interest rate options based on the Base Rate
or LIBO Rate (each term as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement described in the Quarterly Report under the section titled  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ) depending upon certain financial tests. Accordingly,
the Company may be exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under its credit facility. The Company had $191.4 million in borrowings under its New Credit Facility at October 29, 2016 and $192.0 million borrowings at October 31, 2015. A
50 basis point increase in annual interest rates would have increased the Company s interest expense by $0.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in annual interest rates would have reduced
interest expense by $0.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.    The Company does not have any material foreign currency exposure
as nearly all of its business is transacted in United States currency.      

Item 4:   
   Controls and Procedures           Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
      The management of the Company established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
material information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s management conducted an evaluation (as required under Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act), under the supervision and with the participation of the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures  (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). A control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports.  
 Based on management s evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the
period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

     PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1.   
   Legal Proceedings        The Company is involved in a variety of claims, suits,
investigations and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, including actions with respect to contracts, intellectual property, taxation, employment, benefits, securities, personal injuries and other matters.
The results of these proceedings in the ordinary course of business are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.  
 The Company records a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates, at least quarterly, developments in its legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and makes adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to
determine both probability and the estimated amount of a loss or potential loss. The Company may be unable to reasonably estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for a particular legal contingency for various reasons, including, among
others: (i) if the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) if proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) if there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending proceedings (including motions and appeals); (iv) if there is
uncertainty as to the likelihood of settlement and the outcome of any negotiations with respect thereto; (v) if there are significant factual issues to be determined or resolved; (vi) if the proceedings involve a large number of parties;
(vii) if relevant law is unsettled or novel or untested legal theories are presented; or (viii) if the proceedings are taking place in jurisdictions where the laws are complex or unclear. In such instances, there is considerable
uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss, if any.    Legal matters are inherently
unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company s control. As such, there can be no assurance that the final outcome of these matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company s
business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.    Except as otherwise described below with respect to the Adrea LLC
(Adrea) matter, the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible with respect to the matters described below. Based on its current knowledge, the Company has determined that the amount of loss or range of loss that is reasonably
possible (or, in the case of Adrea, probable), including any reasonably possible (or, in the case of Adrea, probable) losses in excess of amounts already accrued, is not estimable.  
 The following is a discussion of the material legal matters involving the Company.  
   PIN Pad Litigation    
 As previously disclosed, the Company discovered that PIN pads in certain of its stores had been tampered with to allow criminal access to card
data and PIN numbers on credit and debit cards swiped through the terminals. Following public disclosure of this matter on October 24, 2012, the Company was served with four putative class action complaints (three in federal district court
in the Northern District of Illinois and one in the Northern District of California), each of which alleged on behalf of national and other classes of customers who swiped credit and debit cards in Barnes   Noble Retail stores common law
claims such as negligence, breach of contract and invasion of privacy, as well as statutory claims such as violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, state data breach notification statutes, and state unfair and deceptive practices
statutes. The actions sought various forms of relief including damages, injunctive or equitable relief, multiple or punitive damages, attorneys  fees, costs, and interest. All four cases were transferred and/or assigned to a single
judge in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and a single consolidated amended complaint was filed. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint in its entirety, and in September
2013, the Court granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice. The Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint, and the Company filed a second motion to dismiss. On October 3, 2016, the Court granted the second motion to dismiss, and
dismissed the case without prejudice; in doing so, the Court permitted plaintiffs to file a second amended complaint by October 31, 2016. On October 31, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The Court set the
following schedule; motion to dismiss brief due on November 30, 2016, opposition brief due January 6, 2017, and reply brief due January 31, 2017. A status hearing is scheduled for March 14, 2017.  
   Cassandra Carag individually and on behalf of others similarly situated v. Barnes   Noble, Inc., Barnes   Noble
Booksellers, Inc. and DOES 1 through 100 inclusive      On November 27, 2013, former Associate Store Manager Cassandra Carag
(Carag) brought suit in Sacramento County Superior Court, asserting claims on behalf of herself and all other hourly (non-exempt) Barnes   Noble employees in California in the preceding four years for unpaid regular and overtime wages based
on alleged off-the-clock work, penalties and pay based on missed meal and rest breaks, and for improper wage statements, payroll records, and untimely pay at separation as a result  
      38

of the alleged pay errors during employment. Via the complaint, Carag seeks to recover unpaid wages and statutory penalties for all hourly Barnes   Noble employees within California from
November 27, 2009 to present. On February 13, 2014, the Company filed an Answer in the state court and concurrently requested removal of the action to federal court. On May 30, 2014, the federal court granted Plaintiff s motion
to remand the case to state court and denied Plaintiff s motion to strike portions of the Answer to the Complaint (referring the latter motion to the lower court for future consideration).  
   Adrea LLC v. Barnes   Noble, Inc., barnesandnoble.com llc and NOOK Media LLC    
 With respect to the Adrea matter described herein, the Company has determined, based on its current knowledge, that a loss is probable. On
June 14, 2013, Adrea filed a complaint against Barnes   Noble, Inc., NOOK Digital, LLC (formerly barnesandnoble.com llc) and B N Education, LLC (formerly NOOK Media LLC) (collectively, B N) in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York alleging that various B N NOOK products and related online services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,298,851 ( 851 patent), 7,299,501 ( 501 patent) and 7,620,703 ( 703 patent). B N filed its
Answer on August 9, 2013, denying infringement and asserting several affirmative defenses. At the same time, B N filed counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments of non-infringement and invalidity with respect to each of the
patents-in-suit. On July 1, 2014, the Court issued a decision granting partial summary judgment in B N s favor, and in particular granting B N s motion to dismiss one of Adrea s infringement claims, and granting
B N s motion to limit any damages award with respect to another of Adrea s infringement claims.    Beginning October 7,
2014, through and including October 22, 2014, the case was tried to a jury in the Southern District of New York. The jury returned its verdict on October 27, 2014. The jury found no infringement with respect to the  851 patent, and
infringement with respect to the  501 and  703 patents. It awarded damages in the amount of $1.3 million. The jury further found no willful infringement with respect to any patent.  
 On July 24, 2015, the Court granted B N s post-trial application to invalidate one of the two patents (the  501 patent) the
jury found to have been infringed. On September 28, 2015, the Court heard post-trial motions on the jury s infringement and validity determinations, and on February 24, 2016, it issued a decision upholding the jury s
determination of infringement and validity with respect to the  703 patent. Since the original damages award was a total award for infringement of both patents, the Court held a new trial to determine damages for infringement of the  703
patent, which trial concluded on July 15, 2016. In a post-trial brief, Adrea asked the Court to award damages of $1.1 million for infringement of the  703 patent alone (calculated by applying a 20.2 cent per unit royalty rate to accused
sales for the period November 2009, when the  703 patent first issued, through June 30, 2014), and requested enhanced damages. B N responded to Adrea s damages claims, asking the Court to award damages of $0.1 million for
infringement of the  703 patent (calculated by applying a 0.2 cent per unit royalty rate to accused sales for the period November 2009 through the date of the first trial verdict, October 22, 2014), and further responded that no enhanced
damages were available as a matter of law. Adrea filed its replies to B N s submissions on September 8, 2016. 
   Caf  Manager Class Actions    
 Two former Caf  Managers have filed separate actions alleging similar claims of entitlement to unpaid compensation for
overtime. In each action, the plaintiff seeks to represent a class of allegedly similarly situated employees who performed the same position (Caf  Manager). Specifically, Christine Hartpence filed a complaint against Barnes  
Noble, Inc. (Barnes   Noble) in Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas on May 26, 2015 (Case No.: 160503426), alleging that she is entitled to unpaid compensation for overtime under Pennsylvania law and seeking to represent a class
of allegedly similarly situated employees who performed the same position (Caf  Manager). On July 14, 2016, Ms. Hartpence amended her complaint to assert a purported collective action for alleged unpaid overtime compensation under
the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), by which she sought to act as a class representative for similarly situated Caf  Managers throughout the United States. On July 27, 2016, Barnes   Noble removed the case to the U.S.
District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Case No.: 16-4034). Ms. Hartpence then voluntarily dismissed her complaint and subsequently re-filed a similar complaint in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas (Case No.:
161003213), where it is currently pending. The re-filed complaint alleges only claims of unpaid overtime under Pennsylvania law and alleges class claims under Pennsylvania law that are limited to current and former Caf  Managers within
Pennsylvania.   On September 20, 2016, Kelly Brown filed a complaint against Barnes   Noble in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York (Case No.: 16-7333) in which she also alleges that she is entitled to unpaid compensation under the FLSA and Illinois law. Ms. Brown seeks to represent a national class of all similarly situated
Caf  Managers under the FLSA, as well as an Illinois-based class under Illinois law. On November 9, 2016, Ms. Brown filed an amended complaint to add an additional plaintiff named Tiffany Stewart, who is a former Caf 
Manager who also alleges unpaid overtime compensation in violation of New York law and seeks to represent a class of similarly situated New York-based Caf  Managers under New York law.

   Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds            Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities       The following table provides information with respect to purchases by the Company of shares of its common stock:

(a) 
 The shares on this table above include 878,195 shares repurchased under the Company s stock repurchase program, as well as 18,208 shares relinquished by employees in exchange for the Company s agreement to pay
federal and state withholding obligations resulting from the vesting of the Company s restricted stock and restricted stock units, which are not drawn against the Company s stock repurchase program. All of the restricted stock and
restricted stock units vested during these periods were originally granted pursuant to the Company s 2009 Amended and Restated Incentive Plan. This Incentive Plan provides for the withholding of shares to satisfy tax obligations due upon the
vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units.      On October 20, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors
authorized a new stock repurchase program for the purchase of up to $50.0 million of its common shares. Stock repurchases under this program may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions from time to time and in such
amounts as management deems appropriate. The repurchase program has no expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company s repurchase plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule
10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company had remaining capacity of approximately $3.5 million under this program as of October 29, 2016. As of October 29, 2016, the Company has repurchased 39,741,262 shares
at a cost of approximately $1.08 billion since the inception of the Company s stock repurchase programs. The repurchased shares are held in treasury.
