SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

General  

The
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 should be read in conjunction with the Company s
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, contained in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on February 18,
2016. As contemplated by the SEC under Article 8 of Regulation S-X, the accompanying financial statements and footnotes have been
condensed and therefore do not contain all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. The interim financial
data are unaudited, however in the opinion of IEG Holdings Corporation ( we,  our ,  us ) the interim
data includes all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of results for
the interim periods. Results of interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those to be expected for the full year.  

Nature
of Business  

The
principal business activity of the Company is providing unsecured $5,000 and $10,000 consumer loans over a five-year term through
its subsidiaries Investment Evolution Corporation and IEC SPV, LLC. The loans are offered under the consumer brand  Mr.
Amazing Loans . The Company is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada and originates consumer loans in the states of Alabama,
Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Texas, Utah, and Virginia via its online platform and distribution network. The Company is a licensed direct lender with state
licenses and/or certificates of authority to lend in these 17 states and offers all loans within the prevailing statutory rates.  

Basis
of Accounting  

These
consolidated financial statements include the operations of IEG Holdings Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Investment
Evolution Corporation and IEC SPV, LLC (collectively, the  Company ). All inter-company transactions and balances
have been eliminated in consolidation.  

The
Company s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and conform
to general practices within the consumer finance industry.  

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect any possible future
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities.  

Liquidity 

The principal conditions/events that raise
substantial doubt of the company s ability to meet its obligations are i) the Company has reported recurring losses and
ii) the Company has not yet generated positive net cash flows from operations. However, the Company has increased its revenue,
management s plans for the next 12 months alleviate the substantial doubt and management evaluates that as a result of these
plans the Company can meet all its obligations through October 2017. Without raising additional debt or equity capital, management s
plans include reducing advertising costs to significantly reduce loan originations and related loan processing costs. There would
also be a significant reduction in consulting and professional fees without additional capital being raised. Management s
plans also include utilizing the funds received from loan principal repayments for operating expenses rather than investing in
loan origination.  In addition, significant core operating
costs have been cut from the Company in 2016 including reducing the number of employees from 12 to 7 due to increased automation
of loan origination processes and reducing the number of office leases from 4 to 1 in the past quarter as old leases expired.
While the Company has sufficient cash on hand at September 30, 2016 combined with anticipated cash flow from loan repayments to
continue operations for at least 12 months, the Company intends, over the next 12 months, to seek additional capital via unsecured
notes to expand operations and the Company has shown the capacity to raise substantial equity capital over the past few years
and, although not the current plan, could seek additional equity capital if required.

Use
of Estimates  

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Management
uses its historical records and knowledge of its business in making these estimates. Accordingly, actual results may differ from
these estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents  

For
the purpose of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers cash equivalents to include short-term, highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less.  

Loans
Receivable and Interest Income  

The
Company is licensed to originate consumer loans in the states of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. During the nine months ended
September 30 2016 and 2015, the Company originated $5,000 and $10,000 loans over a five year term. The Company offers its loans
at or below the prevailing statutory rates. Loans are carried at the unpaid principal amount outstanding, net of an allowance
for credit losses.  

The
Company calculates interest revenue using the interest yield method. Charges for late payments are credited to income when collected.  

Accrual
of interest income on loans receivable is suspended when no payment has been received on account for 91 days or more on a contractual
basis, at which time a loan is considered delinquent. Payments received on nonaccrual financing loans are first applied to the
unpaid accrued interest and then principal. Loans are returned to active status and accrual of interest income is resumed when
all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current; at which time management believes future payments
are reasonably assured. At September 30, 2016, 97 loans with a total balance of $433,781 were delinquent or in default.  

Allowance
for Credit Losses  

The
Company maintains an allowance for credit losses due to the fact that it is probable that a portion of the loans receivable will
not be collected. The allowance is estimated by management based on various factors, including specific circumstances of the individual
loans, management s knowledge of the industry, and the experience and trends of other companies in the same industry.  

Our
portfolio of loans receivable consists of a large number of relatively small, homogenous accounts. The allowance for credit losses
is determined using a systematic methodology, based on a combination of historical bad debt of comparable companies. Impaired
loans are considered separately and 100% charged off.  

The
allowance for credit losses is primarily based upon models that analyze specific portfolio statistics and also reflect, management s
judgment regarding overall accuracy. We take into account several factors, including the customer s transaction history,
specifically the timeliness of customer payments, the remaining contractual term of the loan, and the outstanding balance of the
loan.  

Impaired
Loans  

The
Company assesses loans for impairment individually when a loan is 91 days past due. The Company defines impaired loans as bankrupt
accounts and accounts that are 184 days or more past due. In accordance with the Company s charge-off policy, once a loan
is deemed uncollectible, 100% of the remaining balance is charged-off. Loans can also be charged off when deemed uncollectable
due to consumer specific circumstances.  

The
Company does not accrue interest on impaired loans and any recoveries of impaired loans are recorded to the allowance for credit
losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying statement of operations.  

Property
and Equipment  

Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are being provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets as follows:  

Classification

  NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  SEPTEMBER
30, 2016  

The
Company amortizes its leasehold improvements over the shorter of their economic lives, which are generally five years, or the
lease term that considers renewal periods that are reasonably assured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
as incurred, while renewals and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.  

Operating
Lease  

The
Company s office lease in Las Vegas expires (unless renewed) on September 30, 2017.  

Income
Taxes  

We
account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
740  Income Taxes . To date, no current income tax liability has been recorded due to our accumulated net losses.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities and the amounts that are reported in the income tax returns. Our net deferred income tax assets have
been fully reserved by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize future taxable income and to recover
our net deferred income tax assets.  

Advertising
Costs  

Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to $313,902 and $527,452 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. Advertising costs amounted to $92,593 and $211,828 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  

Earnings
and Loss per Share  

The
Company computes net earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10 that establishes standards for computing and presenting
net earnings (loss) per shares. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) attributed to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed
similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares
that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares, if any, had been issued and if the additional common shares were
dilutive. Basic and diluted loss per share has been adjusted retroactively for the 100-for-1 reverse split that occurred on June
17, 2015 and for the net 10-for-1 reverse split that occurred on October 27, 2016.  

Reclassifications  

Certain
numbers from the prior period have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments  

The
Company has adopted guidance issued by the FASB that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance
with existing generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Assets and liabilities
recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the
inputs used to measure their fair value. The categories are as follows:  

Level
    I   Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.   

Level
    II   Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level I that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration
    with market data at the measurement date.   

Level
    III   Unobservable inputs that reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing
    the asset or liability at the measurement date.   

At
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the only financial instruments that are subject to these classifications are cash and cash equivalents,
which are considered Level I assets.  

Carrying
amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for other receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate
fair value because of their immediate or short-term nature. The fair value of borrowings is not considered to be significantly
different than its carrying amount because the stated rates for such debt reflect current market rates and conditions.

SENIOR DEBT  

The
Company had a credit facility that provided for borrowings of up to $10 million with $0 and $0 outstanding at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively, subject to a borrowing base formula. The Company could borrow, at its option, at the rate
of 18% with a minimum advance of $25,000. Proceeds from this credit facility were used to fund loans to consumers. In July 2015,
the credit facility was converted to a term loan, to be repaid monthly, with payments equal to 100% of the consumer loan proceeds,
with the balance due June 1, 2016. The credit facility was repaid in full on August 21, 2015.  

The
credit facility remains subject to a net profit interest under which the Company will pay BFG Loan Holdings, LLC, 20% of its subsidiary
IEC SPV, LLC s  Net Profit  until 10 years from the date the loan is repaid in full (August 2015). Net Profit
is defined as the gross revenue less (i) interest paid on the loan, (ii) payments on any other debt incurred as a result of an
approved Refinance Event, (iii) any costs, fees or commissions paid on the existing credit facility, and (iv) charge-offs to bad
debt resulting from consumer loans and reduced by servicing fee. If the Refinance event shall be approved by BFG Loan Holdings,
LLC and occur as set forth in the agreement, the net profit percentage shall be reduced to 10%. The Net Profit arrangement can
be terminated by the Company upon a payment of $3,000,000. Net profit interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

Overview   

We
are a consumer finance company providing responsible online personal loan products to customers in 17 states via our website and
online application portal. We provide unsecured loans to individuals. Our $5,000 and $10,000 online personal loans range from
19.9% to 29.9% APR and all are unsecured over a five-year term. We have a 6-year track record of high quality origination, underwriting
and servicing of personal loans to underbanked consumers. We leverage our experience and knowledge in the consumer finance industry
to achieve a meaningful return on our investment in the loan portfolio.  

We
have the ability to finance our businesses from a diversified source of capital and funding, including financings in the capital
markets. During 2015 and the first nine months of 2016, we demonstrated the ability to attract capital markets funding for our
core personal loans by completing private placements of common stock and preferred stock.  

We
operate in one business segment: Consumer Loans.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Interest
Revenue   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, interest revenue increased to $1,586,723, compared to $1,298,112 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. This increase was due to the growth in our interest-earning loan book of consumer receivables. We expect
our interest revenue to grow significantly in future periods as we continue to grow our loan book.  

Other
Revenue   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other revenue increased to $41,156, compared to $29,217 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Other revenue consisted of decline lead revenue, late/dishonor fees, loss recovery and stock application/processing
fees. The increase was attributable to an increase in loss recovery.  

Salaries
and Compensation Expenses   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, salaries and compensation expenses decreased to $1,207,124, compared to $1,551,382 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to the cessation of employment for our VP Corporate
Finance and zero payment of bonuses in Q3 2016 compared to payments in Q3 2015.  

Other
Operating Expenses   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other operating expenses increased to $1,134,836, compared to $905,721 for the nine

filings in the period.  

Consulting
Fees   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, consulting fees decreased to $867,723, compared to $905,002 for the nine months ended

in the period.  

Provision
for Credit Losses   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the provision for credit losses expense increased to $1,000,344, compared to $793,619
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We carry a provision for credit losses which is estimated collectively based on
our loan portfolio and general economic conditions. The increase in provision for credit losses from prior year was due to the
larger loans receivable outstanding balance at September 30, 2016 compared to loans receivable outstanding at September 30, 2015
and an increase in loans charged off during the first quarter of 2016.  

Advertising   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, advertising expenses decreased to $313,902, compared to $527,452 for the nine months

book, including online advertising, direct mail, and lead generation costs.  

Rent
Expense   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, rent expense decreased to $154,838, compared to $187,975 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease was due to reduced relocation costs and termination of Florida, Illinois and Arizona leases.  

Travel,
Meals and Entertainment   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, travel, meals and entertainment expenses increased to $139,253, compared to $101,628
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Travel, meals and entertainment expenses include corporate travel for meetings and
investor presentations, as well as other investor related expenses. The increase was due to the significant increase in investor

and Amortization   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, depreciation and amortization decreased to $7,045, compared to $12,207 for the nine

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense decreased to $0, compared to $596,452 for the nine months ended September

Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Interest
Revenue

Revenue   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, other revenue increased to $10,000, compared to $9,894 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The minimal movement was in line with expectations.  

Salaries
and Compensation Expenses   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, salaries and compensation expenses decreased to $397,795, compared to $718,532 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to the cessation of employment for our VP Corporate
Finance and zero payment of bonuses in Q3 2016 compared to payments in Q3 2015.  

Other
Operating Expenses   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, other operating expenses decreased to $315,368, compared to $329,441 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was attributable to the lower legal and accounting costs associated with our SEC
filings.  

Consulting
Fees   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, consulting fees increased to $414,443, compared to $282,189 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase was attributable to timing of capital raising fees incurred with increased new equity being raised
in the period.  

Provision
for Credit Losses   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the provision for credit losses expense increased to $257,907, compared to $213,611
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We carry a provision for credit losses which is estimated collectively based on
our loan portfolio and general economic conditions. The increase in provision for credit losses from prior year was due to larger
net loan receivables in the period.  

Advertising   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, advertising expenses decreased to $92,593, compared to $211,828 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was attributable to the reduction in customer acquisition costs incurred to grow the loan
book, including online advertising, direct mail, and lead generation costs.  

Rent
Expense   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, rent expense decreased to $47,373, compared to $57,372 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease was due to termination of Florida, Illinois and Arizona leases.  

Travel,
Meals and Entertainment   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, travel, meals and entertainment expenses decreased to $13,085, compared to $25,718
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Travel, meals and entertainment expenses include corporate travel for meetings
and investor presentations, as well as other investor related expenses. The decrease was due to the decrease in investor roadshows
conducted by the CEO in the period compared to the previous period.  

Depreciation
and Amortization   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, depreciation and amortization marginally decreased to $3,212, compared to $4,192 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The minimal movement was in line with expectations.  

Interest
Expense   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense decreased to $0, compared to $122,225 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease is due to repayment of BFG loan facility in August 2015.  

Financial
Position   

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

We
had cash and cash equivalents of $924,552 as of September 30, 2016, compared to $485,559 as of December 31, 2015. The increase
was due to increased equity capital raised in the period.  

Loans
Receivable   

We
had net loan receivables of $7,250,691 as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $7,124,702 as of December 31, 2015. The increase
was due to greater loan originations in the period versus repayment of loan principal by customers.  

Other
Receivables   

We
had other receivables of $141,325 as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $76,262 as of December 31, 2015. Other receivables
comprised outstanding invoices for decline lead revenue due from marketing partners and accrued interest receivable on our consumer
loans at September 30, 2016. The increase in other receivables is primarily due to the refund of unused research services and
increase in accrued interest receivable.  

Property
and Equipment   

We
had net property and equipment of $20,895 as of September 30, 2016 as compared to $28,511 as of December 31, 2015. The minimal
movement was in line with expectations and a direct result of recording depreciation expense for the period plus a loss of $571
on disposal of assets.  

Accounts
Payable and Accrued Expenses   

We
had accounts payable and accrued expenses of $66,119 as of September 30, 2016, compared to $96,441 as of December 31, 2015. The
decrease was due to management s decision to pay a number of September expenses in full in the current period so accrual
was not required for those expenses.  

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources   

We
continue to incur operating expenses in excess of net revenue but cash flow from our existing loan receivables repayments plus
net revenue exceed budgeted cash operating expenses for the next 12 months. To expand operations we will require capital infusions
until operating results improve. We may not be able to obtain such capital in a timely manner and as a result may incur liquidity
imbalances.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We
used cash in operations of $2,095,725 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,948,727 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, and this decrease is in line with expectations due to the continued growth of our revenue. We
used cash in investing activities of $1,126,332 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3,256,639 of cash
used during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to a
decrease in loans receivable originated.  

We
were provided $3,661,050 of net cash from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $7,469,636
during the same period in 2015. The funds were attributable to proceeds from preferred stock and common stock received and was
a decrease from the corresponding period in 2015.  

At
September 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $924,552, which when added to budgeted cash inflows from loans receivable repaid and
budgeted cash inflows from revenues, is sufficient to meet our operating needs for the next 12 months.  

The
principal conditions/events that raise substantial doubt of the company s ability to meet its obligations are i)
the Company has reported recurring losses and ii) the Company has not yet generated positive net cash flows from operations. However,
the Company has increased its revenue, management s plans for the next 12 months alleviate the substantial doubt and management
evaluates that as a result of these plans the Company can meet all its obligations through October 2017. Without raising
additional debt or equity capital, management s plans include reducing advertising costs to significantly reduce
loan originations and related loan processing costs. There would also be a significant reduction in consulting and professional
fees without additional capital being raised. Management s plans also include utilizing the funds received
from loan principal repayments for operating expenses rather than investing in loan origination. In addition, significant
core operating costs have been cut from the Company in 2016 including reducing the number of employees from 12 to 7 due to increased
automation of loan origination processes and reducing the number of office leases from 4 to 1 in the past quarter as old leases
expired. While the Company has sufficient cash on hand at September 30, 2016 combined with anticipated cash flow from loan
repayments to continue operations for at least 12 months, the Company intends, over the next 12 months, to seek additional
capital via unsecured notes to expand operations and the Company has shown the capacity to raise substantial equity capital over
the past few years and, although not the current plan, could seek additional equity capital if required.  

On
August 21, 2015, we, through certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries, paid an aggregate of $1,676,954, representing all principal
and accrued interest under the Loan and Security Agreement, as amended (the  Loan Agreement ), among BFG and certain
of our wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, there is currently no outstanding balance under the Loan Agreement. However, the
Loan Agreement continues in effect and we are subject to a net profit interest under which we are required to pay BFG 20% of the
 Net Profit  of its subsidiary, IEC SPV, LLC, until 10 years from the date the loan is repaid in full (August 2015).
Net Profit is defined as the gross revenue less (i) interest paid on the loan, (ii) payments on any other debt incurred as a result
of refinancing the loan through a third party, as provided in the Loan Agreement, (iii) any costs, fees or commissions paid on
the existing credit facility, and (iv) charge-offs to bad debt resulting from consumer loans and reduced by servicing fee. The
Net Profit arrangement can be terminated by us upon a payment of $3,000,000 to BFG. Net profit interest for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $96,083 and $69,297, respectively. All loans receivable of the Company were pledged as collateral
at September 30, 2016 for the fulfillment of the Net Profit calculation. As of September 30, 2016, $58,885 has been paid and $37,198
was fully accrued for.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term  off-balance sheet arrangement 
generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party,
under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained
or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market
risk support for such assets.  

Basis
of Accounting   

These
consolidated financial statements include the operations of IEG Holdings Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Investment
Evolution Corporation and IEC SPV, LLC (collectively, the  Company ). All inter-company transactions and balances
have been eliminated in consolidation.  

The
Company s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and conform
to general practices within the consumer finance industry.  

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect any possible future
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities.  

The
principal conditions/events that raise substantial doubt of the company s ability to meet its obligations are i)
the Company has reported recurring losses and ii) the Company has not yet generated positive net cash flows from operations. However,
the Company has increased its revenue, management s plans for the next 12 months alleviate the substantial doubt and management
evaluates that as a result of these plans the Company can meet all its obligations through October 2017. Without raising
additional debt or equity capital, management s plans include reducing advertising costs to significantly reduce
loan originations and related loan processing costs. There would also be a significant reduction in consulting and professional
fees without additional capital being raised. Management s plans also include utilizing the funds received
from loan principal repayments for operating expenses rather than investing in loan origination. In addition, significant
core operating costs have been cut from the Company in 2016 including reducing the number of employees from 12 to 7 due to increased
automation of loan origination processes and reducing the number of office leases from 4 to 1 in the past quarter as old leases
expired. While the Company has sufficient cash on hand at September 30, 2016 combined with anticipated cash flow from loan repayments
to continue operations for at least 12 months, the Company intends, over the next 12 months, to seek additional capital via
unsecured notes to expand operations and the Company has shown the capacity to raise substantial equity capital over the
past few years and, although not the current plan, could seek additional equity capital if required.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

We
have identified the following policies below as critical to our business and results of operations. Our reported results are impacted
by the application of the following accounting policies, certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments.
These judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact
quarterly or annual results of operations. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly
as expected, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies
are described in the following paragraphs.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Management
uses its historical records and knowledge of its business in making these estimates. Accordingly, actual results may differ from
these estimates.  

Loans
Receivable and Interest Income   

The
Company offers its loans at or below the prevailing statutory rates. Loans are carried at the unpaid principal amount outstanding,
net of an allowance for credit losses.  

The
Company calculates interest revenue using the interest yield method. Charges for late payments are credited to income when collected.  

Accrual
of interest income on loans receivable is suspended when no payment has been received on account for 91 days or more on a contractual
basis, at which time a loan is considered delinquent. Payments received on nonaccrual financing loans are first applied to the
unpaid accrued interest and then principal. Loans are returned to active status and accrual of interest income is resumed when
all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current; at which time management believes future payments
are reasonably assured. At September 30, 2016, 97 loans with a total balance of $433,781 were delinquent or in default.  

Allowance
for Credit Losses   

The
Company maintains an allowance for credit losses due to the fact that it is probable that a portion of the loans receivable will
not be collected. The allowance is estimated by management based on various factors, including specific circumstances of the individual
loans, management s knowledge of the industry, and the experience and trends of other companies in the same industry.  

Our
portfolio of loans receivable consists of a large number of relatively small, homogenous accounts. The allowance for credit losses
is determined using a systematic methodology, based on a combination of historical bad debt of comparable companies and industry
index. Impaired loans are considered separately and 100% charged off.  

The
allowance for credit losses is primarily based upon models that analyze specific portfolio statistics and also reflect, management s
judgment regarding overall accuracy. We take into account several factors, including the customer s transaction history,
specifically the timeliness of customer payments, the remaining contractual term of the loan, and the outstanding balance of the
loan.  

Impaired
Loans   

The
Company assesses loans for impairment individually when a loan is 91 days past due. The Company defines impaired loans as bankrupt
accounts and accounts that are 184 days or more past due. In accordance with the Company s charge-off policy, once a loan
is deemed uncollectible, 100% of the remaining balance is charged-off. Loans can also be charged off when deemed uncollectable
due to consumer specific circumstances.  

The
Company does not accrue interest on impaired loans and any recoveries of impaired loans are recorded to the allowance for credit
losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying statement of operations.  

Income
Taxes   

We
account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
740  Income Taxes . To date, no current income tax liability has been recorded due to our accumulated net losses.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities and the amounts that are reported in the income tax returns. Our net deferred income tax assets have
been fully reserved by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize future taxable income and to recover
our net deferred income tax assets.  

Earnings
and loss per Share   

The
Company computes net earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10 that establishes standards for computing and presenting
net earnings (loss) per shares. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share
except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if
the potential common shares, if any, had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Basic and diluted loss
per share has been adjusted retroactively for the 100-for-1 reverse split that occurred on June 17, 2015 and for the net 10-for-1
reverse split that occurred on October 27, 2016.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Carrying
amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value
because of their immediate or short-term nature. The fair value of borrowings is not considered to be significantly different
than its carrying amount because the stated rates for such debt reflect current market rates and conditions.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
recent accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require
adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has reviewed
and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on such
review and evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that
it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting.

with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida to effect a 1-for-1,000
reverse stock split (the  Reverse Split ) of the Company s common stock. Upon the completion of the Reverse
Split, stockholders holding only fractional shares will receive a payment for such fractional shares equal to the fair value of
each share of common stock. The fair value of each share of common stock will be determined by the average closing price of the
Company s common stock over the 30 calendar days ending on (and including) the effective date. The foregoing description
is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by the Articles of Amendment attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein
by reference.  

On
October 12, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to the amended and restated articles of incorporation of the Company
with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida to effect, one minute after the Reverse Split, (i) a 100-for-1 forward
stock split of the common stock (the  Forward Split,  and together with the Reverse Split, the  Reverse/Forward
Split ) and (ii) a reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 200,000,000 to 40,000,000 ( Reduction
in Authorized Shares of Common Stock ). The foregoing description is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by the Articles
of Amendment attached as Exhibit 3.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Reverse/Forward Split and Reduction in Authorized Shares of Common Stock was approved by the Company s Board of Directors
and the holder of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company, as required, on August
26, 2016.  

The Reverse/Forward Split
was effective on October 27, 2016 when it was approved by FINRA, as required.

(Forward

hereby amends ( Articles of Amendment ) its amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended ( Articles ),

1. Authorized Capital Stock. The aggregate number of shares which the Corporation shall have the authority to issue is 90,000,000
shares, of which 40,000,000 shares shall be common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shall be preferred stock,
par value $0.001 per share.  

C.       Amendment
of Series H Preferred Stock Terms. The terms of the Series H preferred stock shall be replaced in their entirety with Series H
preferred stock bearing the attributes set forth below, in order to amend the conversion ratio of the Series H Preferred Stock
from two shares of Common Stock per share of Series H Preferred Stock to 0.2 shares of Common Stock per share of Series H Preferred
Stock. The Series H preferred stock terms are hereby replaced in their entirety to read as follows:  

series
h preferred stock    

1.         Designation,
Amounts and Stated Value  . The designation of this series, which consists of Ten Million (10,000,000) shares of
Preferred Stock, is the Series H Preferred Stock (the   Series H Preferred Stock  ). The   Stated
Value   of the Series H Preferred Stock shall be $1 per share, being the per share value of the consideration
received by the Corporation for the issuance of such shares. In the event of a liquidation or winding up of the Corporation,
holders of the Series H Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive the Stated Value per share of Series H Preferred Stock
then outstanding.  

2.         Dividends  .
The Series H Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive 8% per annum dividends paid quarterly.  

3.         Rank  .
The Series H Preferred Stock shall rank  pari passu  with any other series of preferred stock hereafter designated by the
Corporation and not designated as senior securities or subordinate to the Series H Preferred Stock.  

4.         Voting
Rights  . On all matters to come before the shareholder of the Corporation, the holder of Series H Preferred shall have
that number of votes per share (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Series
H Preferred held on the record date for the determination of the holders of the shares entitled to vote (the   Record
Date  ), or, if no Record Date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of shareholders
is first solicited, and (b) 13/100. Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Certificate or by applicable law, the holders
of Series H Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of the outstanding shares of all other capital stock of the Corporation
(including and any other series of preferred stock then outstanding), and not as a separate class, series or voting group.  

5.         Redemption
and Call Rights  . Any time after December 31, 2016, the Corporation shall have the right, but not the obligation, to redeem,
out of funds legally available, all of the unconverted outstanding shares of the Series H Preferred Stock (the   Redemption  ).
The Company shall redeem the Series H Preferred Stock by paying in cash an amount per share equal to $1.00 (the   Redemption
Price  ). In the event that the Corporation elects to redeem the shares of the Series H Preferred Stock, the Corporation
shall give notice of such election by delivering an executed and completed notice of Redemption (  Notice of Redemption  )
to the Holder setting forth the number of shares being redeemed along with the Redemption Price. In the case of the exercise of
the Redemption rights set forth herein, the Redemption privilege shall be deemed to have been exercised upon the date of receipt
by the Holder of the Notice of Redemption.  

6.         Holder
Conversion Rights  . The holders of the Series H Preferred Stock shall have the following rights with respect to the conversion
of the Series H Preferred Stock into shares of the Corporation s Common Stock:  

A.       On
December 31, 2016, and upon notice provided by the holder to the Corporation, a holder shall have the right to convert, at face
value per share, all or any portion of their Series H Preferred Stock into shares of the Corporation s Common Stock on the
basis of 2/10 (0.2) shares of Common Stock for each share of Series H Preferred Stock so converted (the   Conversion Ratio  ).
The Conversion Ratio has been adjusted for (i) the Corporation s rights offering to existing stockholders commenced in August
2015, (ii) the Corporation s rights offering to existing stockholders commenced in December 2015, (iii) the Corporation s
rights offering to existing stockholders commenced in January 2016, (iv) the Corporation s rights offering to existing stockholders
commenced in March 2016, and (v) the Corporation s October 2016 Reverse/Forward Split.  

B.       If
at any time after the date of issuance of the Series H Preferred Stock, in the event the Corporation shall (i) make or issue a
dividend or other distribution payable in Common Stock (other than with respect to the Series H Preferred Stock); (ii) subdivide
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares; or (iii) combine outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
smaller number of shares.  

C.       If
the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series H Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or different number
of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision
or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for elsewhere in this Section 6), then in each such event, the holder of each
share of Series H Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of
stock and other securities and property receivable upon such capital reorganization, reclassification or other change by holders
of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series H Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately
prior to such capital reorganization, reclassification or other change.  

D.       In
each case of an adjustment or readjustment of the conversion ratio, the Corporation, at its expense, will seek to furnish each
holder of Series H Preferred Stock with a certificate, showing such adjustment or readjustment, and stating in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.  

E.       Promptly
after the Corporation s receipt of a conversion notice, and upon surrender of the Series H Preferred Stock certificate for
cancellation, the Corporation shall deliver to the holder a certificate representing the number of the Corporation s shares
of Common Stock into which such Series H Preferred Stock is converted. No fractional shares shall be issued, and, in lieu of any
such fractional securities, each holder of Series H Preferred Stock who will otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share upon
surrender shall receive the next highest whole share.  

7.         Consolidation,
Merger, Exchange, Etc  . In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination, statutory share
exchange or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities,
money and/or any other property, then in any such case the Series H Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged
or changed into preferred shares of the surviving entity providing the holders of such preferred shares with (to the extent possible)
the same relative rights and preferences as the Series H Preferred Stock.  

8.         Designation
of Additional Series  . The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall have the right to designate other shares of Preferred
Stock having:  

a.       dividend,
liquidation, or other preferences equal to, subordinate to, or superior to the rights of holders of the Series H Preferred Stock.
Such preferences shall be determined in the resolutions creating such subsequent series.  

9.         Vote
to Change the Terms of Series H Preferred Stock  . The affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the
written consent without a meeting, of the holders of not less than fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding Series H Preferred
Stock, shall be required for any change to the Corporation s Articles of Incorporation which would amend, alter, change
or repeal any of the powers, designations, preferences and rights of the Series H Preferred Stock.  

10.         Lost
or Stolen Certificates  . Upon receipt by the Corporation of evidence satisfactory to the Corporation of the loss, theft,
destruction or mutilation of any Series H Preferred Stock certificates, and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of any
indemnification undertaking by the holder to the Corporation and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of
the Series H Preferred Stock certificate(s), the Corporation shall execute and deliver new preferred stock certificate(s) of like
tenor and date;  provided, however , the Corporation shall not be obligated to re-issue preferred stock certificates if the
holder contemporaneously requests the Corporation to convert such Series H Preferred Stock into Common Stock in which case such
Series H Preferred Stock shall be converted pursuant to the terms of the Corporation s Articles of Incorporation and a preferred
stock certificate shall only be issued if required pursuant to the terms hereof.  

11.         Failure
or Indulgence Not Waiver  . No failure or delay on the part of a holder of Series H Preferred Stock in the exercise of any
power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power,
right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege.  

12.         Status
of Converted Stock  . In case any shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall be converted, the shares so converted, or reacquired
shall resume the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and shall no longer be designated as Series H Preferred
Stock.  

E.
Authority to Amend. These Articles of Amendment were adopted by the unanimous consent of the Corporation s Board of Directors
on August 26, 2016 and duly approved by the Corporation s stockholders on August 26, 2016 as required by law and the Corporation s
Articles. The number of votes cast for the Articles of Amendment by the stockholders was sufficient for approval.  

D.
Effective Time. The foregoing amendment will become effective on October 17, 2016, at 6:01 p.m. ( Effective Time ).  

IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed these Articles of Amendment as of October 11, 2016.
