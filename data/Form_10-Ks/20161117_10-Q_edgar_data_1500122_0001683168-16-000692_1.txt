NOTE  
1       BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with both accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ( GAAP ), and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and note disclosures
normally included in audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate
to make the information not misleading. 

In the opinion of management, the consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 which has been derived from audited financial statements and these unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary to state fairly the results for the periods
presented. The results for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for
the entire fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 or for any future period. 

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Management s Discussion and the audited financial statements
and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

NOTE
   3       GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES   

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

From its inception, the Company has suffered
from continuous losses with an accumulated deficit of $540,818 as of September 30, 2016 and experienced negative cash flows from
operations. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through September 30, 2017 is dependent upon the continued financial
support from its stockholders. Management believes the Company is currently pursuing additional financing for its operations. However,
there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations. 

These and other factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that
may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE
   4       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements and notes. 

Basis of presentation 

These accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( US
GAAP ). 

Use
of estimates  

In preparing these condensed consolidated financial
statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance
sheets and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Basis
of consolidation  

The condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of GOLU and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and the accounts of PPGCT, which represent substantially all of
the Company s consolidated assets and liabilities. Although the Company legally owns 48% equity interest in PPGCT, there
is an effective control of PPGCT by the common shareholders of the Company and PPGCT, and whose financial statements are required
to be consolidated. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions were eliminated in consolidation. 

Cash and cash equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost
and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. 

Land under development 

Land under development relating to freehold
farmland, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated
on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational. 

Long-lived assets primarily include freehold
farmland held for development. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360,   Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets  , the Company generally conducts its annual impairment evaluation to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth
quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business
climate. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the reporting unit level. If the total of the expected undiscounted
future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value
and carrying amount of the asset. There has been no impairment charge for the periods presented.

  (Unaudited)  

Policy for Capitalizing
Development Cost   

The cost of land includes the purchase price
of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to planning, developing, initial leasing and constructing
a property are capitalized and classified as Land under Development in the balance sheets. Capitalized development costs include
interest, and other direct project costs incurred during the period of development. As of September 30, 2016, there was no such
capitalized interest and capitalized development cost. 

A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition,
development and construction of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component
of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease
involves a degree of judgment. The Company adopts the capitalization policy on development properties, which is guided by ASC Topic
835-20   Interest   Capitalization of Interest   and ASC Topic 970   Real Estate - General  .
The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction
costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, salaries and related
costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company considers a construction project as substantially
completed and held available for occupancy upon the receipt of certificates of occupancy, but no later than one year from cessation
of major construction activity. The Company ceases capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or
held available for occupancy, and the Company capitalized only those costs associated with the portion under construction. No cost
was capitalized during the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Income taxes 

The provision for income taxes is determined
in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ). Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. 

ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for
how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected
to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more
likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently
be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement
with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions. 

Net loss per share 

The Company calculates net loss per share in
accordance with ASC Topic 260,   Earnings per Share.   Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net income
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic
loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been
outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. 

There were no potentially outstanding dilutive
shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Related parties 

The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.

STATEMENTS  

  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER

  (Currency expressed in United States Dollars
( US$ ), except for number of shares)  

  (Unaudited)  

Pursuant to section 850-10-20 the related parties
include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent
the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825 10 15, to be accounted
for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and Income-sharing
trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the
Company; f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management
or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its
own separate interests; and g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the
transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other
to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. 

The financial statements shall include disclosures
of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the
ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined
financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a) the nature of the relationship(s)
involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for
each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding
of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods
for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used
in the preceding period; and d) amount due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and,
if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement. 

Commitments and contingencies 

The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the
financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future
events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise
of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims
that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims
as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. 

If the assessment of a contingency indicates
that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated
liability would be accrued in the Company s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material
loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent
liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. 

Loss contingencies considered remote are generally
not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based
upon information available at this time, that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and
adversely affect the Company s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows. 

Fair
value of financial instruments  

The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph
820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to measure the fair value of
its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a framework for measuring
fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase
consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value
hierarchy defined by paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are described below: 

Level 1  
       
      Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   

Level 2  
       
      Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.   

Level 3  
       
      Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

GOLD UNION INC.  

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER
30, 2016  

  (Currency expressed in United States Dollars
( US$ ), except for number of shares)  

  (Unaudited)  

Financial assets are considered Level 3 when
their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one
significant model assumption or input is unobservable. 

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the
categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. 

The carrying amounts of the Company s
financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because
of the short maturity of these instruments. 

Transactions involving related parties cannot
be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not
exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were
consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated. 

Recent accounting pronouncements 

The Company has reviewed all recently issued,
but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected
to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations. 

NOTE
   5       LAND UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Currency and exchange
rate  

Unless otherwise noted,
all currency figures quoted as  U.S. dollars ,  dollars  or  $  refer to the legal currency
of the United States. Throughout this report, assets and liabilities of the Company s subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during

Overview  

We were incorporated under
the laws of the State of Delaware on July 6, 2010 under the name  Advanced Ventures Corp.  and are a development stage
company. Effective January 6, 2014, we changed our name to  Gold Union Inc.  

On July 27, 2010, we entered
into an exclusive worldwide patent sale agreement (the  Patent Transfer and Sales Agreement ) with Ilanit Appelfeld
(the  Seller ), in relation to a patented technology, U.S. Patent Number: 6,743,209 (the  Patent ), for
a catheter with a integral anchoring mechanism. The patent and technology were transferred to us in exchange of payment to Ilanit
Appelfeld of $17,500 (seventeen thousand five hundred United States Dollars), according to the terms and conditions specified in
the Patent Transfer and Sales Agreement related to U.S. Patent Number: 6,743,209. 

During the second quarter
of 2011 the Company raised gross proceeds of $75,000 pursuant to an effective Form S-1 Registration Statement and issued 37,500,000
post forward stock split shares of common stock that were registered pursuant to the Form S-1 Registration Statement. 

During our second fiscal
quarter of 2014, we elected to discontinue our business of exploiting the Patent and to consider other business opportunities that
may bring quicker and greater value to our stockholders. We initially intended to engage in the business of trading precious metal
bullion primarily in the Asia Pacific region. Therefore, effective January 6, 2014, we changed our name to  Gold Union Inc. 
to more adequately reflect our intended business operations. 

During the third fiscal
quarter of 2014, we identified an opportunity to enter into the real property development business in Cambodia. On August 28, 2014,
we executed a Share Exchange Agreement with G.U. International Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of the Republic
of Seychelles and our wholly owned subsidiary ( GUI ), and Kao Wei-Chen, an individual representing herself and 8 other
individuals (collectively, the  Golden Corridor Shareholders ), which agreement was amended several times to extend
the closing date of the acquisition (collectively, the  Share Exchange Agreement ). Pursuant to the Share Exchange
Agreement, we, through GUI, purchased 480 shares of Phnom Penh Golden Corridor Trading Co. Limited (the  GC Shares ),
from 9 private Golden Corridor Shareholders, representing 48% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Golden Corridor.
As consideration, we agreed to issue to the Golden Corridor Shareholders 2,500,000,000 shares of our common stock, at a value of
US $0.002 per share, for an aggregate value of US $5,000,000. We consummated the acquisition of the GC Shares on December 31, 2015. 

Golden Corridor owns three
parcels of land located at National Road 44, Phum Phkung, Chbarmorn Commune, Chbarmorn District, Kampong Speu Province, Kingdom
of Cambodia, measuring an aggregate of 172,510 square meters (collectively, the  Properties ). Pursuant to an independent
valuation conducted by a third party appraisal firm licensed under the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Cambodia and the Securities
and Exchange Commission of Cambodia, the Properties have an estimated value of US $10,350,600 as of April 8, 2014. Golden Corridor
intends to develop the Properties into an industrial park for rental income within the next two or three years. Golden Corridor
has not yet commenced any significant operations but expects to begin efforts to prepare and submit the relevant planning and development
application and information necessary to commence the development process. 

As a result of our acquisition
of the GC Shares, we elected to cease our metal bullion trading business and enter into the real estate development and rental
business located in the Kingdom of Cambodia. 

Intellectual Property  

We continue to own the
rights, title and interests in Patent for a receptacle catheter with integral anchoring means, which Patent is associated with
our former business. The Patent was issued on September 1, 2004 and will expire on September 6, 2022. 

Employees  

We currently do not have
any full time or part time employees. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Secretary, Lim Yew Chuan, is expected
to carry out all administrative functions. Once Golden Corridor begins development activities, we expect Golden Corridor to hire
additional officers and employees for such operations. 

We do not have any union
employees.     

Transfer Agent  

We have engaged Nevada
Agency and Transfer Company as our stock transfer agent. Nevada Agency and Transfer Company is located at 50 West Liberty Street,
Reno, Nevada 89501. Their telephone number is (775) 322-0626 and their fax number is (775) 322-5623. The transfer agent is responsible
for all record-keeping and administrative functions in connection with our issued and outstanding common stock. 

Research and Development  

We have incurred minimal
research and development expenses to date and do not plan to undertake additional research and development activities during the
next twelve months. 

Subsidiaries  

On July 21, 2014, we formed
G.U. Asia Limited, a limited company, under the laws of Hong Kong, for the purpose of conducting business in Asia. 

On July 31, 2014, we formed
G.U. International Limited, a limited company, under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles. G.U. International Limited holds 48%
of the issued and outstanding securities of Golden Corridor. 

Financial Condition  

During the twelve-month
period following the date of this quarterly report, we anticipate that we will not generate any revenue. Accordingly, we will be
required to obtain additional financing in order to pursue our plan of operations during and beyond the next twelve months. We
believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding as we do not have tangible assets to secure any debt financing.
We anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock or shareholder
loans. However, we do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to
raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or shareholder loans to establish our new business. 

Results of Operations   

Comparison of the three months ended September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  

The following table sets
forth certain operational data for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30,
2015: 

Net Revenue . We
have not generated revenues since inception. We are working to develop our real estate development business in Cambodia and hope
to generate revenue as such business develops. 

Operating Expenses .
During the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, we incurred operating expenses of $13,000 and $22,733 respectively,
consisting of professional fees and general and administrative expenses. The decrease in our operating expenses resulted from a
decrease in administrative expenses offset by an increase in professional fees. 

We expect our operating
expenses to increase as we build and develop our real estate development business. 

Loss Before Income Taxes,
Net Loss . We recorded a loss before income taxes of $13,000 and $22,733 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Similarly, we recorded a net loss of $13,000 and $22,733 for the same three-month period ended September 30, 2016
and 2015. The decrease in loss before income taxes and net loss resulted from a decrease in general and administrative expenses. 

Comparison of the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  

The following table sets
forth certain operational data for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015: 

Net Revenue . We
have not generated revenues since inception. We are working to develop our real estate development business in Cambodia and hope
to generate revenue as such business develops. 

Operating Expenses .
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, we incurred operating expenses of $54,215 and $90,565, respectively,
consisting of professional fees and general and administrative expenses. The decrease in operating expenses resulted from a decrease
in professional fees and general and administrative expenses. 

We expect our operating
expenses to increase as we build and develop our real estate development business. 

Loss Before Income Taxes,
Net Loss . We recorded a loss before income taxes of $54,215 and $90,565 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Similarly, we recorded a net loss of $54,215 and $90,565 for the same nine-month period ended September 30, 2016
and 2015. The decrease in loss before income taxes and net loss resulted from a decrease in professional fees and general and administrative
expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our financial statements
have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the
recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue
in operation.  We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent
upon obtaining financing to develop our real estate business. For these reasons our auditors stated in their report on our audited
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 that they have substantial doubt we will be able to continue as a going
concern.  

As of September 30, 2016,
our current assets were $95,817 and our current liabilities were $244,292 resulting in a working capital deficit of $148,475. Our
current assets as of September 30, 2016, consisted of $91,175 of cash and cash equivalents and $4,642 of prepayments and deposits. 

As of September 30, 2016,
our total assets were $725,817, including land under development of $630,000. As of December 31, 2015, our total assets were $750,577,
including land under development of $630,000 

Stockholders  equity
decreased from $153,890 as of December 31, 2015 to $112,550 as of September 30, 2016. 

We have not paid dividends
on our Common Stock. Our present policy is to apply cash to investments in product development, acquisitions or expansion; consequently,
we do not expect to pay dividends on Common Stock in the foreseeable future. 

The success of our growth
strategy is dependent upon the availability of additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to management. Our sources of
capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions and public
offerings, capital leases and long-term debt. There can be no assurance that we can raise such additional capital resources on
satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support operations
for at least the next 12 months.  We anticipate continuing to rely on equity
sales of our common shares and shareholder loans in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional
shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of
our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our plan of operations.   

Net Cash Used In Operating
Activities . 

We have not generated any
revenues since inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $47,981 compared
to net cash used in operating activities of $46,014 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Cash Provided By
Financing Activities . 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $23,221 as compared to net cash used in financing activities
of $4,440 for the same period ended September 30, 2015. Net cash provided from financing activities during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, consisted of advances from stockholders. Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, consisted of repayments to related parties. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no outstanding
off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities
involving non-exchange traded contracts. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions,
estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and
contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial
statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations.
Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations
and require management's subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because
of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ
significantly from management's current judgments. We believe the following accounting policies are critical in the preparation
of our financial statements. 

Basis of presentation   

The condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of GOLU and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and the accounts of PPGCT, which represent substantially all of
the Company s consolidated assets and liabilities. Although the Company legally owns 48% equity interest in PPGCT, there
is an effective control of PPGCT by the common shareholders of the Company and PPGCT, and whose financial statements are required
to be consolidated. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions were eliminated in consolidation. 

Land under development   

Land under development relating to freehold
farmland, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated
on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational. 

Long-lived assets primarily include freehold
farmland held for development. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360,   Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets  , the Company generally conducts its annual impairment evaluation to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth
quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business
climate. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the reporting unit level. If the total of the expected undiscounted
future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value
and carrying amount of the asset. There has been no impairment charge for the periods presented. 

Policy for Capitalizing
Development Cost   

The cost of land includes the purchase price
of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to planning, developing, initial leasing and constructing
a property are capitalized and classified as Land under Development in the balance sheets. Capitalized development costs include
interest, and other direct project costs incurred during the period of development. As of September 30, 2016, there was no such
capitalized interest and capitalized development cost. 

A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition,
development and construction of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific
component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization
must cease involves a degree of judgment. The Company adopts the capitalization policy on development properties, which is guided
by ASC Topic 835-20   Interest   Capitalization of Interest   and ASC Topic 970   Real Estate -
General  . The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized
costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest
costs, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company considers a construction
project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the receipt of certificates of occupancy, but no later
than one year from cessation of major construction activity. The Company ceases capitalization on the portion (1) substantially
completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and the Company capitalized only those costs associated with the portion
under construction. No cost was capitalized during the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph
820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to measure the fair value of
its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a framework for measuring
fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase
consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value
hierarchy defined by paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are described below: 

Level 1  
       
      Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   

Level 2  
       
      Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.   

Level 3  
       
      Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

Financial assets are considered Level 3 when
their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one
significant model assumption or input is unobservable. 

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the
categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. 

The carrying amounts of the Company s
financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because
of the short maturity of these instruments. 

Transactions involving related parties cannot
be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not
exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were
consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated. 

Related Parties   

The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. 

Pursuant to section 850-10-20 the related parties
include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent
the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825 10 15, to be accounted
for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and Income-sharing
trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the
Company; f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management
or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its
own separate interests; and g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the
transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other
to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. 

The financial statements shall include disclosures
of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the
ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined
financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a) the nature of the relationship(s)
involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for
each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding
of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods
for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used
in the preceding period; and d) amount due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and,
if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement. 

Income Taxes   

The provision for income taxes is determined
in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ). Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. 

ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for
how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected
to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more
likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently
be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement
with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions. 

Recent accounting pronouncements   

The Company has reviewed all recently issued,
but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected
to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

ITEM 4       Controls and Procedures    

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule
13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), under the supervision of and with the
participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures,
subject to limitations as noted below, as of September 30, 2016, and during the period prior to and including the date of this
report, were not effective to ensure that all information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s
rule and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Manager concluded that (i) there continue to be material weaknesses in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting,
that the weaknesses constitute a  deficiency  which could result in misstatements of the foregoing accounts and disclosures
that could result in a material misstatement to the financial statements for the period covered by this report that would not be
detected, and (ii) accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. 

Inherent Limitations   

Because of its inherent
limitations, our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

Subject to the foregoing disclosure, there were
no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016,
that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
