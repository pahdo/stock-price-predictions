In addition, we are also looking to market, sell, and distribute anti-aging products, as on December 29, 2015 our company signed a five-year exclusive licensing agreement with Biomatrix, Inc. for the People s Republic of China and Europe.  The agreement will allow Science to Consumers Inc., to market and sell at least six of the special formulated anti-aging products including the DermaLastyl line.

We expect to generate revenues in China from sales of our products to individual customers and commercial customers such as spas, stores and massage therapy offices.

Our potential client list consists of 4 companies ranging from beauty stores, spas massage therapy offices, and cosmetic distributors.     The majority of our business will be initially marketed in China, Hong Kong, and Germany but as our operations expand, we plan to expand to other European markets. We are also looking at opportunities to expand our operations and expand other product lines in the USA, European, and Asian markets.     Our company will focus on providing helpful customer service. We are currently selling six products that are available to be purchased through our website, and wholesale orders are also being accepted from June 1, 2016. Our company plans on engaging in an e-commerce strategy to be able to drive its online sales.

Our company is also looking at distributing its licensed products through some potential JV partnerships.

The terms of the Assignment Agreement signed on January 19, 2015 have not been met and a new agreement with similar terms and pricing were negotiated and entered into on December 29, 2015.     Effective December 29, 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Biomatrix Inc., a Delaware corporation, pursuant to which we obtained the exclusive rights to sell certain proprietary skincare products of Biomatrix by direct to consumer marketing and sales in the territories of China and Europe.

     Table of Contents          Marketing and Distribution      Our main source of marketing will be digital media via Internet. We plan to promote our products at our website www.sciencetoconsumers.com. As well as through our Chinese e-commerce platform and website which is being developed and should be ready by the end of October 2016. Our website will list the benefits of using our products. We will print business cards and have our website listed on it. We will print out brochures with our product list for our potential clients. The client will also be able to submit order requests and/or contact us via email linked to our website or call our company directly.  In addition, in order to market our products online we will try and market the products by using search engine optimization, social media mediums as Twitter and Facebook     Furthermore, we plan to attend different fairs and trade shows to further promote our business, hand out business cards, meet potential clients and referrals.     At last, the best marketing of our business will be our pricing. We will focus on sourcing our product from suppliers with high quality product and competitive pricing. Involving no commission based agents we plan to take the product straight from the factory to the buyer, keeping the prices competitive.      Currently, our company is focused on marketing its products in China and our activities can be broken down into two segments as follows:     CHINA ACTIVITIES:     1.     On September 1, 2016 our company signed an Exclusive Distributor Agreement signed with SHI TU KANG TRADING CO LTD., (STK ) with office located in Nan Sha district, Guangzhou China. STK is a privately owned cosmetics, health   beauty, fragrance, and personal care trading a distribution company. In order to leverage the infrastructure in place with STK as our company will rely on STK s support on sharing resources, office space and depending on their full assistance to customize packaging, boxes design, private label with Chinese brand name patent ( ) for the Chinese market.  The agreement states that STK will commit to provide the full turnkey services to simply importing products with valid import license from Hong Kong via Hai Tao Base official platform to marketing S2C products to their existing sales channels such as beauty parlours, drugstores, WeChat shops, beauty chain stores and as well some of their existing online shops.     2.     S2C and STK have jointly agreed to develop a website for the China market. The website is still under development and is expected to be ready by end of October.       3.     As part of the STK Agreement, STK with one of its key wholesalers has agreed to import products and display S2C products in three of the most busiest and eyes catching locations where there are guaranteed large volumes of visitors in Guangzhou city.      HONG KONG ACTIVITIES:     1.     Our company is working on establishing a partnership agreement with a very large and leading cosmetics retailing group in Asia with over 280 retail stores and sales counters in Asia selling over 700 brands of skincare, fragrance, make up, hair care and body care products, health and beauty supplements including own brands and exclusive products. The potential partnership being negotiated will have the potential partner agreeing to buy S2C products but requirements of the order size are yet to be confirmed including but not limited to packaging revision, promoters at retail stores recruitment and renting a light box area     2.     S2C will engage social media strategy to connect customers and use platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to spread more products awareness and create brand loyalty among customers, thus reinforcing what make S2C products unique. We have been doing some research on some Hong Kong cost effective social media companies such as: OKI Media ( http://okimedia.com.hk ); Finger Shopping (http://www.fingershopping.com); HK TV Mall ( http://www.hktvmall.com ); Groupon (http://www.groupon.hk);Yahoo HK (https://hk.deals.yahoo.com/hong-kong)          Competition      Our competition will include other distribution companies, importers, and agents with the same or similar product list. However, there is an increase in public interest in natural products and cosmetics and the field grows rapidly and there is a constant need for new pure and organic products. We expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. Competitors include companies with more substantial customer bases. There can be no assurance that we can maintain a competitive position against current or future competitors, particularly those with greater financial, marketing, service, and support, technical and other resources. Our failure to maintain a competitive position within the market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.      Compliance with Government Regulation      We do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.  However, our company will require to have in place the necessary import permits and licenses in order to import the products into China.      Insurance      We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us, which could cause us to cease operations.      Research and Development      We have incurred $Nil in research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.  We rely on our Licensor to conduct all research and development activities      Intellectual Property      We do not currently have any intellectual property, other than our domain name and website, www.sciencetoconsumers.com.      Employees      We are a development stage company and currently have no employees other than our president, chief financial officer, treasurer and sole director, Vitaliy Gorelik, our chief executive officer, Edwon Lam and Caroline Bastidas, our secretary.                 6

Item 6. Selected Financial Data       As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report, particularly in the section entitled  Risk Factors  beginning on page 6 of this annual report.     Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.      Plan of Operations and Cash Requirements        Cash Requirements      We estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the twelve month period to be as follows:         We have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed.     The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing, successful sales of our products, and finally, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.     There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. As noted herein, we are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.                  9

Going Concern      We have suffered recurring losses from operations and are dependent on our ability to raise capital from stockholders or other sources to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. In their report on our audited financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2016, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosure describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.      Critical Accounting Policies       The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.      Basis of Presentation      The financial statements of our company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars.            Accounting Basis      Our company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP  accounting). Our company has adopted a May 31 fiscal year end.       Cash and Cash Equivalents      Our company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our company had $3,306 of cash as of May 31, 2016 and $1,749 as of May 31, 2015.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments      Our company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents and amounts due to shareholder. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.      Website Development Costs      Website development costs consist of costs incurred to develop internet websites to promote, advertise, and earn revenue with respect to our company s business operations. Costs are amortized on a straight line basis over 3 years from when the internet web site has been completed.       Income Taxes      Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Revenue Recognition      Our company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.             Stock-Based Compensation      Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. To date, our company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.      Basic Income (Loss) Per Share      Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing our company s net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing our company s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of May 31, 2016 and 2015.       Comprehensive Income      Our company has which established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. When applicable, our company would disclose this information on its Statement of Stockholders  Equity. Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Our company has not had any significant transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive income.      Reclassifications      Certain amounts in the fiscal 2015 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2016 presentation, specifically classifications between bank service charges, general and administrative expenses and professional fees.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements      Our company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure       As disclosed on our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 7, 2016, on April 7, 2016, KLJ   Associates, LLP resigned as our independent registered public accounting firm.      The reports of KLJ   Associates, LLP on our financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle except to indicate that there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.     Our Board of Directors participated in and approved the decision to change independent registered public accounting firms.     During the fiscal years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no disagreements with KLJ   Associates, LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction KLJ   Associates, LLP would have caused them to make reference thereto in connection with their report on the financial statements for such years.     On April 25, 2016, our company engaged Yichien Yeh, CPA as its new independent registered public accounting firm. During the two most recent fiscal years, our company had not consulted with Yichien Yeh, CPA regarding any of the following:            (i)  the application of accounting principles to a specific transaction, either completed or proposed;               (ii)  the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, and none of the following was provided to our company: (a) a written report, or (b) oral advice that Yichien Yeh, CPA concluded was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or               (iii)  Any matter that was subject of a disagreement, as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K.          There were no disagreements related to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, internal controls or auditing scope or procedure during the two fiscal years and interim periods.       Item 9A. Controls and Procedures         Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures       We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information disclosed in the reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     Management, including our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of May 31, 2016, in accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in SEC rules and forms.            Our management, including our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), do not expect that our disclosure controls, and procedures or internal controls will prevent all possible error and fraud. Our disclosure controls and procedures are, however, designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) have concluded that our financial controls and procedures are not effective at that reasonable assurance level.       Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting       Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that transactions are executed in accordance with management s authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in  Internal Control-Integrated Framework . Our management has concluded that, as of May 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles. Our management reviewed the results of their assessment with our board of directors.     This annual report does not include an attestation report of our company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit our company to provide only management s report in this annual report.       Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls       Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.       Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting       There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended May 31, 2016 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.       Item 9B. Other Information       None.             PART III        Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance       All directors of our company hold office until the next annual meeting of the security holders or until their successors have been elected and qualified. The officers of our company are appointed by our board of directors and hold office until their death, resignation or removal from office. Our directors and executive officers, their ages, positions held, and duration as such, are as follows:          Business Experience      The following is a brief account of the education and business experience during at least the past five years of each director, executive officer and key employee of our company, indicating the person s principal occupation during that period, and the name and principal business of the organization in which such occupation and employment were carried out.

From 2010 to present Mr. Gorelik still works part-time at Kurhaus and part-time devoting his attention to our company.

Edwon Lam - Chief Executive Officer       Mr. Lam has twenty years of marketing management experience in the consumer packaged goods industry consistently increasing revenue, market share and profitability combined with 2 years experience in marketing research consultancy.

Our company believes that Ms. Bastidas  professional background experience gives her the qualifications and skills necessary to serve as an officer of our company.     Our board of directors consists solely of Vitaliy Gorelik.      Significant Employees      There are no individuals other than our executive officers who make a significant contribution to our company.      Employment Agreements      We have no formal employment agreements with any of our directors or officers.       Family Relationships      There are no family relationships between any of our directors, executive officers and proposed directors or executive officers.       Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings      To the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years:                 1.    been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offences);                         2.    had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time;                         3.    been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity;                         4.    been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;                         5.    been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or                         6.    been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29)), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.                    Compliance with Section 16(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934      Our common stock is not registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Accordingly, our officers, directors, and principal stockholders are not subject to the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.      Code of Ethics      We have not yet adopted a code of ethics that applies to our sole officer and director, or persons performing similar functions because we are in the start-up phase and are in the process of establishing our operations. We plan to adopt a code of ethics as and when our company grows to a sufficient size to warrant such adoption.      Audit Committee      As we have only a sole director, we have not established an audit committee as at the date of this registration statement, nor do we have plans to establish an audit committee until such time as we have established our full operations, and retained sufficient independent directors as members of our board of directors willing to be appointed to the audit committee and carry out the customary functions of an audit committee.      Director Nominees      We do not have a nominating committee. Our sole director will in the future select individuals to stand for election as members of our board of directors. The company does not have a policy with regards to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by our security holders. Our board has determined that it is in the best position to evaluate our company s requirements as well as the qualifications of each candidate when it considers a nominee for a position on our board. If security holders wish to recommend candidates directly to our board, they may do so by communicating directly with our sole officer and director at the address specified on the cover of this registration statement.      Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert      We do not currently have an audit committee or a committee performing similar functions. The board of directors as a whole participates in the review of financial statements and disclosure.     Our board of directors has determined that it does not have a member of its audit committee that qualifies as an  audit committee financial expert  as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and is  independent  as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.     We believe that the sole member of our board of directors is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an  audit committee financial expert  would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. In addition, we currently do not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our sole director does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because believes the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the sole member of our board of directors              Item 11. Executive Compensation       The particulars of the compensation paid to the following persons:                 (a)    our principal executive officer;                         (b)    each of our two most highly compensated executive officers who were serving as executive officers at the end of the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015; and                         (c)    up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have been provided under (b) but for the fact that the individual was not serving as our executive officer at the end of the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, who we will collectively refer to as the named executive officers of our company, are set out in the following summary compensation table, except that no disclosure is provided for any named executive officer, other than our principal executive officers, whose total compensation did not exceed $100,000 for the respective fiscal year:                  SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE        Name   and   Principal   Position           Year           Salary   ($)                Bonus   ($)                Stock   Awards   ($)                Option   Awards   ($)                Non-Equity   Incentive Plan Compensation   ($)                Change in   Pension   Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings   ($)                All   Other   Compensation   ($)                Total   ($)                                                                                                                                                     Vitaliy Gorelik (1)   President, Chief   Financial Officer,          2016         Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil            Treasurer and Director          2015         Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil                                                                                                                                                    Burt Ensley (2)          2016              N/A                   N/A                   N/A                   N/A                   N/A                   N/A                   N/A                   N/A            Chief Executive Officer          2015         Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil                                                                                                                                                                                            Edwon Lam (3)          2016         Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil              Nil            Chief Executive Officer          2015              N/A                   N/A                   N/A                   N/A                   N/A                   N/A                   N/A                   N/A          _________________      There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension, retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers. Our directors and executive officers may receive share options at the discretion of our board of directors in the future. We do not have any material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except that share options may be granted at the discretion of our board of directors.       Grants of Plan-Based Awards      We have not granted any options or stock appreciation rights to our named executive officers or directors since inception. We do not have any stock option plans.      Compensation of Directors      We do not have any agreements for compensating our directors for their services in their capacity as directors, although such directors are expected in the future to receive stock options to purchase shares of our common stock as awarded by our board of directors.            We have determined that none of our directors are independent directors, as that term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.      Pension, Retirement or Similar Benefit Plans      There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension, retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers. We have no material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except that stock options may be granted at the discretion of the board of directors or a committee thereof.       Indebtedness of Directors, Senior Officers, Executive Officers and Other Management      None of our directors or executive officers or any associate or affiliate of our company during the last two fiscal years, is or has been indebted to our company by way of guarantee, support agreement, letter of credit or other similar agreement or understanding currently outstanding.       Compensation Committee      We do not currently have a compensation committee of the board of directors or a committee performing similar functions. The board of directors as a whole participates in the consideration of executive officer and director compensation.       Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters       The following table sets forth, as of September 12, 2016, certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common shares by each shareholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common shares, as well as by each of our current directors and executive officers as a group. Each person has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of common stock, except as otherwise indicated. Beneficial ownership consists of a direct interest in the shares of common stock, except as otherwise indicated.      _________________         (1)    Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on September 12, 2016. As of September 12, 2016, there were 31,920,000 shares of our company s common stock issued and outstanding.       (2)    Vitaliy Gorelik is our president, chief financial officer, treasurer and director.       (3)    Edwon Lam is our chief executive officer.       (4)    Caroline Bastidas is our secretary.                Changes in Control      We are unaware of any contract or other arrangement or provisions of our Articles or Bylaws the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change of control of our company. There are not any provisions in our Articles or Bylaws, the operation of which would delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of our company.       Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence       Except as disclosed herein, no director, executive officer, shareholder holding at least 5% of shares of our common stock, or any family member thereof, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, or proposed transaction since the year ended May 31, 2016, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at the year-end for the last three completed fiscal years.       Director Independence      We currently act with one director consisting of Vitaliy Gorelik. We have determined that our sole director is not an  independent director  as defined in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15).     We do not have a standing audit, compensation or nominating committee, but our entire board of directors acts in such capacities. We believe that our members of our board of directors are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The board of directors of our company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because we believe that the functions of an audit committee can be adequately performed by the board of directors. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an  audit committee financial expert  would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development.       Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services       The aggregate fees billed for the most recently completed fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 and for fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows:          Our board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.     Our board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining our independent auditors  independence.             PART IV        Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules                   (a)    Financial Statements                    (1)    Financial statements for our company are listed in the index under Item 8 of this document.
