BOSTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 

1.     Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc. (the  Company  or  BPFH ), is a bank holding company (the  Holding Company ) with four reportable segments: Private Banking, Wealth Management and Trust, Investment Management, and Wealth Advisory.  
  The Private Banking segment is comprised of the banking operations of Boston Private Bank   Trust Company (the  Bank  or  Boston Private Bank ), a trust company chartered by The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the  FDIC ), and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Boston Private Bank currently operates in three geographic markets: New England, San Francisco Bay Area, and Southern California.  
  In June 2016, the Bank entered into a definitive agreement to sell two of its offices in the Southern California market, located in Granada Hills and Burbank, California. Certain assets identified as part of the sale of   $0.9 million   are included in assets held for sale, which is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. Certain deposits identified as part of the sale of   $105.8 million   are included in deposits held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. 
  The Wealth Management and Trust segment is comprised of the operations of Boston Private Wealth LLC ( Boston Private Wealth ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boston Private Bank, and the trust operations of Boston Private Bank. The segment offers investment management, wealth management, family office, and trust services to individuals, families, and institutions. The Wealth Management and Trust segment operates in New England; South Florida; Texas; California; Madison, Wisconsin; and the Washington, D.C. area.  
  The Investment Management segment has two consolidated affiliates, consisting of Dalton, Greiner, Hartman, Maher   Co., LLC ( DGHM ) and Anchor Capital Advisors, LLC ( Anchor ) (together, the  Investment Managers ). 
  The Wealth Advisory segment has two consolidated affiliates, consisting of KLS Professional Advisors Group, LLC ( KLS ) and Bingham, Osborn   Scarborough, LLC ( BOS ) (together, the  Wealth Advisors  and, together with the Wealth Management and Trust and Investment Management segments, the  Wealth and Investment businesses ).  
  The Company conducts substantially all of its business through its four reportable segments. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), and include all necessary adjustments of a normal recurring nature which, in the opinion of management, are required for a fair presentation of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The interim results of consolidated operations are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year. 
  The information in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Prior period amounts are reclassified whenever necessary to conform to the current period presentation. 
  The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Part II. Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the SEC. For interim reporting purposes, the Company follows the same significant accounting policies. 

2.    Earnings Per Share 
  The treasury stock method of calculating earnings per share ( EPS ) is presented below for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . The following tables present the computations of basic and diluted EPS:

_____________________ 
           (1) 
    See Part II. Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14: Noncontrolling Interests  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a description of the redemption values related to the redeemable noncontrolling interests. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 480,   Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity   ( ASC 480 ), an increase in redemption value from period to period reduces income attributable to common shareholders. Decreases in redemption

    BOSTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

value from period to period increase income attributable to common shareholders, but only to the extent that the cumulative change in redemption value remains a cumulative increase since adoption of this standard in the first quarter of 2009.  
           (2) 
    The Company presents its EPS based on the treasury stock method. The Company reverted to the treasury stock presentation from the two-class presentation due to the immaterial number of participating shares outstanding as of March 31, 2016. If the EPS presentation had been based on the two-class method, the following adjustments would have been made to the presentation of EPS for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
     Net income attributable to common shareholders would have been reduced by an additional   $4 thousand  , for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , with   no   change for the three month period then ended. The allocation of net income to participating securities would have been   $1 thousand   and   $7 thousand  , for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, reducing net income attributable to common shareholders by a total of   $1 thousand   and   $11 thousand  , for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Basic EPS would not change. Weighted average diluted shared outstanding would have been reduced by   3,809 shares   and   13,477 shares   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Diluted EPS would not change. 
  If the EPS presentation had been based on the two-class method, the following adjustments would have been made to the presentation of EPS for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net income attributable to common shareholders would have been reduced by an additional   $5 thousand   and   $85 thousand  , for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and the allocation of net income to participating securities would have been   $8 thousand   and   $91 thousand  , for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, reducing net income attributable to common shareholders by a total of   $13 thousand   and   $176 thousand  , for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Basic EPS would decrease by   $0.01   per share for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , with   no   change for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding would have been reduced by   69,218 shares   and   211,108 shares  , for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Diluted EPS would not change. 
           (3) 
    The diluted EPS computations for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   do not assume the conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of the following shares for the following periods because the result would have been anti-dilutive for the periods indicated. As a result of the anti-dilution, the potential common shares excluded from the diluted EPS computation are as follows: 

3.    Reportable segments 
  Management Reporting 
  The Company has   four   reportable segments (Private Banking, Wealth Management and Trust, Investment Management, and Wealth Advisory) and the Holding Company (Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc.). The financial performance of the Company is managed and evaluated by these four areas. The segments are managed separately as a result of the concentrations in each function. 
  Measurement of Segment Profit and Assets 
  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Part II. Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Revenues, expenses, and assets are recorded by each segment, and separate financial statements are reviewed by their management and the Company s segment chief executive officers.

4.    Investments 
  The following table presents a summary of investment securities: 

_____________________ 
           (1) 
     All mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or Government-sponsored entities. 
     The following table presents the maturities of available-for-sale investment securities, based on contractual maturity,   as of September 30, 2016  . Certain securities are callable before their final maturity. Additionally, certain securities (such as mortgage-backed securities) are shown within the table below based on their final (contractual) maturity, but due to prepayments and amortization are expected to have shorter lives.

    BOSTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

The following table presents the maturities of held-to-maturity investment securities, based on contractual maturity,   as of September 30, 2016  . 

The following table presents the proceeds from sales, gross realized gains and gross realized losses for available-for-sale securities that were sold or called during the following periods: 

The following table presents information regarding securities   as of September 30, 2016   having temporary impairment, due to the fair values having declined below the amortized cost of the individual securities, and the time period that the investments have been temporarily impaired.  

_____________________ 
           (1) 
     All mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or Government-sponsored entities. 
     The U.S. government and agencies securities, and mortgage-backed securities in the table above had current Standard and Poor s credit ratings of AA+. The municipal bonds in the table above had current Standard and Poor s credit ratings of at least AA-. The other securities consisted of equity securities. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company does not consider these investments other-than-temporarily impaired because the decline in fair value on investments is primarily attributed to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the amount of investment securities in an unrealized loss position greater than 12 months, as well as in total, was primarily due to changes in interest rates. The Company has no intent to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   and it is not more likely than not that the Company would be forced to sell any  
  
    14 

    BOSTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

of these securities prior to the full recovery of all unrealized loss amounts. Subsequent to   September 30, 2016   and through the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, no securities were downgraded to below investment grade, nor were any securities in an unrealized loss position sold. 
  Cost method investments, which are included in other assets, can be temporarily impaired when the fair values decline below the amortized costs of the individual investments. There were   no   cost method investments with unrealized losses   as of September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . The Company s cost method investments primarily include low income housing partnerships which generate tax credits. The Company also holds partnership interests in venture capital funds formed to provide financing to small businesses and to promote community development. The Company had   $35.4 million   and   $27.7 million   in cost method investments included in other assets   as of September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

5.    Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value is defined under GAAP as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC 820 ), which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Financial instruments are considered Level 1 when valuation can be based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 financial instruments are valued using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data of substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable and when determination of the fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 
  The following tables present the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis   as of September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall:

    BOSTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

As of September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , available-for-sale securities consisted primarily of U.S. government and agencies securities, government-sponsored entities securities, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and other available-for-sale securities. The equities (which are categorized as other available-for-sale securities) are valued with prices quoted in active markets. Five U.S. Treasury securities at   September 30, 2016   and three U.S. Treasury securities at   December 31, 2015  , are valued with prices quoted in active markets. Therefore, they have been categorized as a Level 1 measurement. The government-sponsored entities securities, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certain investments in Small Business Administration ( SBA ) loans (which are categorized as U.S. government and agencies securities) generally have quoted prices but are traded less frequently than exchange-traded securities and can be priced using market data from similar assets. Therefore, they have been categorized as a Level 2 measurement.   No   investments held at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015   were categorized as Level 3. There were no changes in the valuation techniques used for measuring the fair value of available-for-sale securities in the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   or 2015.  
  The Company uses interest rate customer swaps, interest rate swaps, risk participation agreements, and a junior subordinated debenture interest rate swap to manage its interest rate risk, and customer foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its foreign exchange risk, if any. The junior subordinated debenture interest rate swap agreement matured on December 30, 2015. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. Therefore, they have been categorized as a Level 2 measurement   as of September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . See Part I. Item 1.  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 8: Derivatives and Hedging Activities  for further details. 
  To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, the Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. Counterparty exposure is evaluated by netting positions that are subject to master netting agreements, as well as considering the amount of collateral securing the position. 
  The Company has determined that the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, although the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of  
  
    16 

    BOSTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy   as of September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  Other investments, which are not considered available-for-sale investments, consist of deferred compensation trusts, which consist of publicly traded mutual fund investments that are valued at prices quoted in active markets. Therefore, they have been categorized as a Level 1 measurement   as of September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  There were no transfers between levels for assets or liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis during the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  There were   no   Level 3 assets valued on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  
  The following tables present the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall:

           (1) 
    Collateral-dependent impaired loans held at   September 30, 2016   that had write-downs in fair value or whose specific reserve changed during the first   nine months   of   2016  .

Impaired loans include those loans that were adjusted to the fair value of underlying collateral as required under ASC 310,   Receivables  . The amount does not include impaired loans that are measured based on expected future cash flows discounted at the respective loan s original effective interest rate, as that amount is not considered a fair value measurement. The Company uses appraisals, which management may adjust to reflect estimated fair value declines, or apply other discounts to appraised values for unobservable factors resulting from its knowledge of the property or consideration of broker quotes. The appraisers use a market, income, and/or a cost approach in determining the value of the collateral. Therefore they have been categorized as a Level 3 measurement. 
  The following tables present the carrying values and fair values of the Company s financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis (other than certain loans, as noted below):

    BOSTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

The estimated fair values have been determined by using available quoted market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies. The aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company taken as a whole. An excess of fair value over book value on financial assets represents a premium, or gain, the Company might recognize if the asset were sold, while an excess of book value over fair value on financial liabilities represents a premium, or gain, the company might recognize if the liability were sold. Conversely, losses would be recognized if an asset was sold where the book value exceeded the fair value or a liability was sold where the fair value exceeded the book value.  
  The fair value estimates provided are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and the characteristics of the financial instrument. The estimates do not provide for any premiums or discounts that could result from concentrations of ownership of a financial instrument. Because no active market exists for some of the Company s financial instruments, certain fair value estimates are based on subjective judgments regarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of the financial instruments, future expected loss experience, prepayment assumptions, and other factors. The resulting estimates involve uncertainties and are considered best estimates. Changes made to any of the underlying assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
  Cash and cash equivalents 
  The carrying value reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of their maturities and are classified as Level 1. 
  Held-to-maturity investment securities 
  Held-to-maturity securities currently include mortgage-backed securities.  All held-to-maturity securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but may be traded in active markets. The fair value of these securities is based on quoted market prices obtained from external pricing services. The principal market for our securities portfolio is the secondary institutional market, with an exit price that is predominantly reflective of bid level pricing in that market.     Accordingly, held-to-maturity securities are included in the Level 2 fair value category. 
  Loans held for sale 
  Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value in the aggregate. Fair value estimates are based on actual commitments to sell the loans to investors at an agreed upon price or current market prices if rates have changed since the time the loan closed. Accordingly, loans held for sale are included in the Level 2 fair value category.

Loans, net  
  Fair value estimates are based on loans with similar financial characteristics. Fair values of commercial and residential mortgage loans are estimated by discounting contractual cash flows adjusted for prepayment estimates and using discount rates approximately equal to current market rates on loans with similar credit and interest rate characteristics and maturities. The fair value estimates for home equity and other loans are based on outstanding loan terms and pricing in the local markets. The method of estimating the fair value of the loans disclosed in the table above does not incorporate the exit price concept in the presentation of the fair value of these financial instruments. Net loans are included in the Level 3 fair value category based upon the inputs and valuation techniques used. 
  Other financial assets 
  Other financial assets consist of accrued interest and fees receivable, stock in Federal Home Loan Banks ( FHLBs ), other assets held for sale, and the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, for which the carrying amount approximates fair value, and are classified as Level 2. 
  Deposits 
  The fair values reported for transaction accounts (demand, NOW, savings, and money market) equal their respective book values reported on the balance sheets and are classified as Level 2. The fair values disclosed are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair values for certificates of deposit are based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rates used are representative of approximate rates currently offered on certificates of deposit with similar remaining maturities and are classified as Level 2. 
  Deposits held for sale 
  The deposits held for sale at September 30, 2016 relate to the two banking offices in Southern California for which the Bank has entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement (the  Agreement ). Pursuant to this Agreement, the Bank will transfer certain depository accounts of these offices to the purchaser. The fair value reported for deposits held for sale was estimated based on the deposit premium to be paid by the acquirer per the Agreement and the amount and type of deposits outstanding as of September 30, 2016. The actual premium will be updated based on the average deposits prior to the close. Accordingly, deposits held for sale are included in the Level 2 fair value category. 
  Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
  The fair value of securities sold under agreements to repurchase is estimated based on contractual cash flows discounted at the Bank s incremental borrowing rate for FHLB borrowings with similar maturities and therefore these securities have been classified as Level 2. 
  Federal funds purchased 
  The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased approximate fair value due to their short-term nature and therefore these funds have been classified as Level 2. 
  Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings 
  The fair value reported for FHLB borrowings is estimated based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate used is based on the Bank s estimated current incremental borrowing rate for FHLB borrowings of similar maturities and therefore these borrowings have been classified as Level 2. 
  Junior subordinated debentures 
  The fair value of the junior subordinated debentures issued by Boston Private Capital Trust I and Boston Private Capital Trust II were estimated using Level 3 inputs such as the interest rates on these securities, current rates for similar debt, a consideration for illiquidity of trading in the debt, and regulatory changes that would result in an unfavorable change in the regulatory capital treatment of this type of debt. 
  Other financial liabilities 
  Other financial liabilities consist of accrued interest payable for which the carrying amount approximates fair value and is classified as Level 2.

Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk 
  The Bank s commitments to originate loans and for unused lines and outstanding letters of credit are primarily at market interest rates and therefore, the carrying amount approximates fair value. 

6.    Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality 
  The Bank s lending activities are conducted principally in the regions of New England, San Francisco Bay Area, and Southern California. The Bank originates single and multi-family residential loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, construction and land loans, and home equity and other consumer loans. Most loans are secured by borrowers  personal or business assets. The ability of the Bank s single family residential and consumer borrowers to honor their repayment commitments is generally dependent on the level of overall economic conditions within the Bank s lending areas. Commercial, construction, and land borrowers  ability to repay is generally dependent upon the health of the economy and real estate values, including, in particular, the performance of the construction sector. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank s loan portfolio is susceptible to changing conditions in the New England, San Francisco Bay Area, and Southern California economies and real estate markets. 
  Total loans include deferred loan origination (fees)/ costs, net, of   $6.3 million   and   $5.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  The following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio based on the portfolio segment as of the dates indicated:  

The following table presents nonaccrual loans receivable by class of receivable as of the dates indicated: 

The Bank s policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest on a loan when the collectability of principal or interest is in doubt. In certain instances, although infrequent, loans that have become 90 days or more past due may remain on accrual status if the value of the collateral securing the loan is sufficient to cover principal and interest and the loan is in the process of collection. There were   no   loans 90 days or more past due, but still accruing as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Bank s policy for returning a loan to accrual status requires the loan to be brought current and for the client to show a history of making timely payments (generally six consecutive months). For troubled debt restructured loans ( TDRs ), a return  
  
    21 

    BOSTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

to accrual status generally requires timely payments for a period of six months in accordance with the restructured loan terms, along with meeting other criteria.  
  The following tables show the payment status of loans by class of receivable as of the dates indicated: 

Nonaccrual and delinquent loans are affected by many factors, such as economic and business conditions, interest rates, unemployment levels, and real estate collateral values, among others. In periods of prolonged economic decline, borrowers may become more severely affected over time as liquidity levels decline and the borrower s ability to continue to make payments deteriorates. With respect to real estate collateral values, the declines from the peak, as well as the value of the real estate at the time of origination versus the current value, can impact the level of problem loans. For instance, if the loan to value ratio at the time of renewal has increased due to the decline in the real estate value since origination, the loan may no longer meet the Bank s underwriting standards and may be considered for classification as a problem loan dependent upon a review of risk factors.  
  Generally when a collateral dependent loan becomes impaired, an updated appraisal of the collateral, if appropriate, is obtained. If the impaired loan has not been upgraded to a performing status within a reasonable amount of time, the Bank will continue to obtain updated appraisals as deemed necessary, especially during periods of declining property values.  
  The past due status of a loan is determined in accordance with its contractual repayment terms. All loan types are reported past due when one scheduled payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more.

Credit Quality Indicators 
  The Bank uses a risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of its loan portfolio. Loan classifications are assessments made by the Bank of the status of the loans based on the facts and circumstances known to the Bank, including management s judgment, at the time of assessment. Some or all of these classifications may change in the future if there are unexpected changes in the financial condition of the borrower, including but not limited to, changes resulting from continuing deterioration in general economic conditions on a national basis or in the local markets in which the Bank operates adversely affecting, among other things, real estate values. Such conditions, as well as other factors which adversely affect borrowers  ability to service or repay loans, typically result in changes in loan default and charge-off rates, and increased provisions for loan losses, which would adversely affect the Company s financial performance and financial condition. These circumstances are not entirely foreseeable and, as a result, it may not be possible to accurately reflect them in the Company s analysis of credit risk. 
  A summary of the rating system used by the Bank, repeated here from Part II. Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, follows: 
  Pass   - All loans graded as pass are considered acceptable credit quality by the Bank and are grouped for purposes of calculating the allowance for loan losses. Generally, only commercial loans, including commercial real estate, commercial and industrial loans, and construction and land loans are given a numerical grade. For residential, home equity and consumer loans, the Bank classifies loans as pass unless there is known information such as delinquency or client requests for modifications which, due to financial difficulty, would then generally result in a risk rating such as special mention or more severe depending on the factors.  
  Special Mention   - Loans rated in this category are defined as having potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit or the Bank s credit position. These loans are currently protected but have the potential to deteriorate to a substandard rating. For commercial loans, the borrower s financial performance may be inconsistent or below forecast, creating the possibility of liquidity problems and shrinking debt service coverage. In loans having this rating, the primary source of repayment is still good, but there is increasing reliance on collateral or guarantor support. Collectability of the loan is not yet in jeopardy. In particular, loans in this category are considered more variable than other categories, since they will typically migrate through categories more quickly. 
  Substandard   - Loans rated in this category are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. A substandard credit has a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Substandard loans may be either still accruing or nonaccruing depending upon the severity of the risk and other factors such as the value of the collateral, if any, and past due status.  
  Doubtful   - Loans rated in this category indicate that collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, is highly questionable and improbable. Loans in this category are usually on nonaccrual and classified as impaired.  
  The following tables present the loan portfolio s credit risk profile by internally assigned grade and class of receivable as of the dates indicated:

    Recorded investment represents the client loan balance net of historical charge-offs and historical nonaccrual interest paid, which was applied to principal.  
     When management determines that it is probable that the Bank will not collect all principal and interest on a loan in accordance with the original loan terms, the loan is designated as impaired.  
  Loans that are designated as impaired require an analysis to determine the amount of impairment, if any. Impairment would be indicated as a result of the carrying value of the loan exceeding the estimated collateral value, less costs to sell, for collateral dependent loans or the net present value of the projected cash flow, discounted at the loan s contractual effective interest rate, for loans not considered to be collateral dependent. Generally, shortfalls in the analysis on collateral dependent loans would result in the impairment amount being charged-off to the allowance for loan losses. Shortfalls on cash flow dependent loans may be carried as specific allocations to the general reserve unless a known loss is determined to have occurred, in which case such known loss is charged-off. 
  Loans in the held for sale category are carried at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value in the aggregate and are excluded from the allowance for loan losses analysis. 
  The Bank may, under certain circumstances, restructure loans as a concession to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Such loans are classified as TDRs and are included in impaired loans. TDRs typically result from the Bank s loss mitigation activities which, among other things, could include rate reductions, payment extensions, and/or principal forgiveness. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , TDRs totaled   $30.6 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $26.1 million   of the   $30.6 million   in TDRs were on accrual status. As of   December 31, 2015  ,   $18.6 million   of the   $30.6 million   in TDRs were on accrual status.  
  
    26 

    BOSTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

Since all TDR loans are considered impaired loans, they are individually evaluated for impairment. The resulting impairment, if any, would have an impact on the allowance for loan losses as a specific reserve or charge-off. If, prior to the classification as a TDR, the loan was not impaired, there would have been a general or allocated reserve on the particular loan. Therefore, depending upon the result of the impairment analysis, there could be an increase or decrease in the related allowance for loan losses. Many loans initially categorized as TDRs are already on nonaccrual status and are already considered impaired. Therefore, there is generally not a material change to the allowance for loan losses when a nonaccruing loan is categorized as a TDR.  
  The following tables present the balance of TDRs that were restructured or defaulted during the periods indicated and the types of concessions granted:

8.    Derivatives and Hedging Activities  
  The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and, to a lesser extent, the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are generally determined by interest rates. The Company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to certain loans, deposits, and borrowings. 
  The following table presents the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

    There was an additional   $(19) thousand   related to the ineffective portion for the three months ended as of   September 30, 2016   and   no   ineffective portion for the three months ended as of September 30, 2015.

           (1)  
    There was an additional   $26 thousand   related to the ineffective portion for the nine months ended as of   September 30, 2016   and   no   ineffective portion for the nine months ended as of September 30, 2015. 
       
  The following table presents the components of the Company s accumulated other comprehensive income/ (loss) related to the derivatives for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The Bank has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain provisions where, if the Bank defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Bank could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. The Bank was in compliance with these provisions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  The Bank also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain provisions where, if the Bank fails to maintain its status as a well- or adequately-capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Bank would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements. The Bank was in compliance with these provisions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  Certain of the Bank s agreements with its derivative counterparties contain provisions where if specified events or conditions occur that materially change the Bank s creditworthiness in an adverse manner, the Bank may be required to fully collateralize its obligations under the derivative instruments. The Bank was in compliance with these provisions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  
    34 

    BOSTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the termination amounts related to collateral determinations of derivatives in a liability position were   $32.7 million   and   $9.7 million  , respectively. The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with its derivative counterparties and pledged securities with market values of   $36.2 million   and   $9.8 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , against its obligations under these agreements. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, the Company had posted cash collateral of   $2.0 million   against its obligations under these agreements. The collateral posted is typically greater than the current liability position. However, due to timing of liability position changes at period end, the funding of a collateral shortfall may take place shortly following period end.  
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest income and expense and to manage the risk related to exposure to changes in interest rates.   To accomplish this objective, the Bank entered into a total of   six   interest rate swaps, one during 2014 with an effective date of June 1, 2014, and five during 2013 with effective dates of December 1, 2014, September 2, 2014, June 1, 2014, March 1, 2014, and August 1, 2013. The six interest rate swaps each have a notional amount of $25 million and have terms ranging from three to six years. The Bank s risk management objective and strategy for these interest rate swaps is to reduce its exposure to variability in interest-related cash outflows attributable to changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) swap rate associated with borrowing programs for each of the periods, initially expected to be accomplished with LIBOR-indexed brokered deposits, but may also include LIBOR-indexed FHLB advances. The interest rate swaps will effectively fix the Bank s interest payments on   $150 million   of its LIBOR-indexed liabilities at rates between 1.17% and 2.32%, and a weighted average rate of 1.85%. 
  The Company uses the  Hypothetical Derivative Method  described in ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging   ( ASC 815 ), for quarterly prospective and retrospective assessments of hedge effectiveness, as well as for measurements of hedge ineffectiveness. Under this method, the Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in cash flows of the designated hedged transactions. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income ( OCI ) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings in interest and dividend income when the hedged transactions affect earnings. Ineffectiveness resulting from the hedge is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations as part of fees and other income. There was an immaterial amount of hedge ineffectiveness during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and no hedge ineffectiveness during the three and nine months ended September 30,   2015  . The Company monitors the risk of counterparty default on an ongoing basis.  
  A portion of the balance reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income or expense as interest payments are made or received on the Company s interest rate swaps. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that   $1.3 million   will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense.  
  Non-designated Hedges 
  Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from two different services the Bank provides to qualified commercial clients. The Bank offers certain derivative products directly to such clients. The Bank economically hedges derivative transactions executed with commercial clients by entering into mirror-image, offsetting derivatives with third parties. Derivative transactions executed as part of these programs are not designated in ASC 815-qualifying hedging relationships and are, therefore, marked-to-market through earnings each period. Because the derivatives have mirror-image contractual terms, the changes in fair value substantially offset through earnings. The net effect on earnings is primarily driven by changes in the credit valuation adjustment ( CVA ). The CVA represents the dollar amount of fair value adjustment related to nonperfomance risk of both the Bank and its counterparties. Fees earned in connection with the execution of derivatives related to this program are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in other income.   As of September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had   130   and   76   derivatives, respectively, related to this program, comprised of interest rate swaps and caps, with an aggregate notional amount of   $1.0 billion   and   $475.3 million  , respectively. There were   no   foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding related to this program as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
  In addition, as a participant lender, the Bank has guaranteed performance on the pro-rated portion of two swaps executed by other financial institutions. As the participant lender, the Bank is providing a partial guarantee, but is not a direct party to the related swap transactions. The Bank has no obligations under the risk participation agreements unless the borrower defaults on their swap transaction with the lead bank and the swap is in a liability position to the borrower. In that instance, the Bank has agreed to pay the lead bank a portion of the swap s termination value at the time of the default. The derivative transactions entered into as part of these agreements are not designated, as per ASC 815, as qualifying hedging relationships and are, therefore, marked-to-market through earnings each period. The pro-rated notional amount of these risk participation transactions was   $13.3 million   as of September 30, 2016 and   $8.3 million   as of December 31, 2015.

  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

The Bank has also participated out to another financial institution a pro-rated portion of two swaps executed by the Bank.  The other financial institution has no obligations under the risk participation agreements unless the borrowers default on their swap transactions with the Bank and the swaps are in liability positions to the borrower. In those instances, the other financial institution has agreed to pay the Bank a portion of the swap s termination value at the time of the default. The derivative transactions entered into as part of these agreements are not designated, as per ASC 815, as qualifying hedging relationships and are, therefore, marked-to-market through earnings each period. The pro-rated notional amount of these risk participation transactions was   $6.1 million   as of September 30, 2016.  There were   no   risk participation agreements participated out as of December 31, 2015. 
  The following table presents the effect of the Bank s derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments in the consolidated statement of operations for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

9.    Income Taxes 
  The following table presents the components of income tax expense for continuing operations, discontinued operations, noncontrolling interests and the Company: 

The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   31.0%  , with related tax expense of   $23.7 million  , was calculated based on a projected 2016 annual effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was less than the statutory rate of   35%   due primarily to earnings from tax-exempt investments, income tax credits, and income attributable to noncontrolling interests. These items were partially offset by state and local income taxes. 
  The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   33.8%  , with related tax expense of   $24.8 million  , was calculated based on a projected 2015 annual effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was less than the statutory rate of   35%   due primarily to earnings from tax-exempt investments, income tax credits, and income attributable to noncontrolling interests. These items were partially offset by state and local income taxes and an out-of-period adjustment related to non-deductible executive compensation, as described in more detail below. 
  The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is lower than the effective tax rate for the same period in 2015 due primarily to an out-of-period adjustment recorded during the third quarter of 2015.  The Company reevaluated its executive compensation plans during the third quarter of 2015 and discovered that certain executive compensation that was previously treated as fully deductible was non-deductible.  The correction resulted in   $1.8 million   of additional tax expense that was related to prior years.  After evaluating the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the correction, the Company determined that previously issued quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements were not materially misstated and, as a result, recorded the correction in the third quarter of 2015.

10.    Noncontrolling Interests  
  At the Company, noncontrolling interests typically consist of equity owned by management of the Company s respective majority-owned affiliates. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations represents the net income allocated to the noncontrolling interest owners of the affiliates. Net income allocated to the noncontrolling interest owners was   $1.1 million   and   $1.0 million   for the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and    $3.0 million   and   $3.5 million   for the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  On the consolidated balance sheets, noncontrolling interests are included as the sum of the capital and undistributed profits allocated to the noncontrolling interest owners. Typically, this balance is included in a company s permanent shareholders  equity in the consolidated balance sheets. When the noncontrolling interest owners  rights include certain redemption features, as described in ASC 480,   Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity  , such redeemable noncontrolling interests are classified as mezzanine equity and are not included in permanent shareholders  equity. Due to the redemption features of the noncontrolling interests, the Company had redeemable noncontrolling interests held in mezzanine equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of   $16.2 million   and   $18.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The aggregate amount of such redeemable noncontrolling equity interests are recorded at the estimated maximum redemption values. In addition, the Company had   $3.8 million   and   $3.4 million   in noncontrolling interests included in permanent shareholder s equity at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Each non-wholly owned affiliate operating agreement provides the Company and/or the noncontrolling interests with contingent call or put redemption features used for the orderly transfer of noncontrolling equity interests between the affiliate noncontrolling interest owners and the Company at either a contractually predetermined fair value; multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA); or fair value. The Company may liquidate these noncontrolling interests in cash, shares of the Company s common stock, or other forms of consideration dependent on the operating agreement. These agreements are discussed in Part II. Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 14: Noncontrolling Interests  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  Generally, these put and call redemption features refer to shareholder rights of both the Company and the noncontrolling interest owners of the Company s majority-owned affiliate companies. The affiliate company noncontrolling interests generally take the form of limited liability company (LLC) units, profits interests, or common stock (collectively, the  noncontrolling equity interests ). In most circumstances, the put and call redemption features generally relate to the Company s right and, in some cases, obligation to purchase and the noncontrolling equity interests  right to sell their equity interests. There are various events that could cause the puts or calls to be exercised, such as a change in control, death, disability, retirement, resignation or termination. The puts and calls are generally to be exercised at the then fair value or a contractually agreed upon approximation thereof. The terms of these rights vary and are governed by the respective individual operating and legal documents. 
  The following table presents, by affiliate, the noncontrolling interests included as redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests in mezzanine and permanent equity, respectively, at the periods indicated:  

_____________________ 
  (1)    Only includes redeemable noncontrolling interests.

12.    Restructuring 
  In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company incurred restructuring charges related to the acquisition of Banyan Partners, LLC. The purpose of this restructuring was to realign the management structure within the Wealth Management and Trust segment. The total cost of the restructuring incurred in Q4 2014 was   $0.7 million  . In 2015, the Company incurred additional restructuring charges to further refine the management structure within the Wealth Management and Trust segment.  The total cost of the restructuring charges in 2015 was   $3.7 million  .  
  In the first and second quarters of 2016, the Company incurred additional costs of   $1.1 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively, in continued refinement of the management structure within the Wealth Management and Trust segment.  The Company does not anticipate any additional restructuring costs related to this plan as of the date of this filing. 
  Restructuring expenses incurred since the plan of restructuring was first implemented in 2014 totaled   $6.4 million  , all within the Wealth Management and Trust segment.

13.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-04,   Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructuring by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40) - Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure  . The amendments to this update are intended to clarify when a creditor should be considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan such that the loan should be derecognized and the real estate recognized. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-09 ), amending the ASC and creating a new Topic 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   This issuance was part of the joint project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. The impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s consolidated financial statements is not yet known. Additionally, ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-09 ) was issued in August 2015 which defers adoption to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This update is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based plans such as income tax consequences, classification of awards as either liabilities or equity on the balance sheet, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,  
  
    41 

    BOSTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

including interim periods within those years. Although early adoption is permitted, the Company does not plan on adopting prior to 2017. The Company does not expect that this ASU will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements although fluctuations in the Company s stock price between issuance date and settlement date of employee share-based transactions will lead to fluctuations in earnings once this ASU is implemented. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . This ASU update is intended to increase transparency and comparability among companies by recognizing right of use lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods and is to be implemented utilizing a modified retrospective approach.  The Company expects that this ASU will gross up the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the lease assets and liabilities. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments (Topic 326)   ( ASU 2016-13 ). This update is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is available as of the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not plan on adopting early. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   ( ASU 2016-15 ). This update is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. The Company does not expect that this ASU will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Executive Summary 
  Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc. offers a wide range of wealth management and private banking services to high net worth individuals, families, businesses and select institutions through its four reportable segments: Private Banking, Wealth Management and Trust, Investment Management, and Wealth Advisory. This Executive Summary provides an overview of the most significant aspects of our operating segments and the Company s operations in the   third quarter   of   2016  . Details of the matters addressed in this summary are provided elsewhere in this document and, in particular, in the sections immediately following. 

_____________________ 
  nm     not meaningful 
  Net income attributable to the Company was   $19.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $13.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . The Company recognized diluted earnings per share of   $0.22   and   $0.16   for the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Key items that affected the Company s results in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015   include:  
             
    The Company recorded a   $0.1 million   credit to the provision for loan losses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a provision for loan losses of   $2.6 million   for the same period of   2015  . The credit to the provision for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to decreases in loss factors, and net recoveries of $2.1 million, offset by an increase in criticized loans and loan growth.  
                
    Fees and other income increased   1%   to   $40.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $39.4 million   for the same period of   2015  . This increase was driven by banking fee revenue and a gain on the fair value of derivative instruments, partially offset by a   13%   decrease in wealth management and trust fees, and a   6%   decrease in investment management fees. Total fees and other income represents 45% of total revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to 46% of total revenue for the same period of   2015  .  
                
    Operating expenses remained relatively flat at   $61.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $61.9 million   for the same period of   2015  . Increases in salaries and employee benefits,  
     
    44 

occupancy and equipment, and contract services and data processing were offset by decreases in professional services, marketing and business development, and other expenses. Additionally, the Company incurred no restructuring expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.5 million during the same period in 2015 related to the Wealth Management and Trust segment.  
  The Company s Private Banking segment reported net income attributable to the Company of   $17.4 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , compared to net income attributable to the Company of   $13.8 million   for the same period of   2015  . The   $3.6 million  , or   26%  , increase was a result of the increase in net interest income, the credit to the provision for loan losses, and the market value adjustment on derivatives for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , partially offset by increased operating expenses, particularly salaries and employee benefits.  
  The Company s Wealth Management and Trust segment reported a net loss attributable to the Company of   $0.8 million   in both the   third quarter  s of   2016   and   2015  . The 2016 loss was the result of decreased revenue due to the decrease in AUM during the previous twelve months. Wealth management and trust fee revenue decreased $1.6 million as compared to the same period in 2015. Additionally, $0.5 million of other income recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to the reversal of a portion of the contingent earnout for Banyan that will not repeated in 2016 or in future periods. The revenue decrease was partially offset by decreased operating expenses, primarily due to the lack of restructuring expenses in the third quarter of 2016 and which were $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2015. Wealth Management and Trust AUM decreased   $0.7 billion  , or   9%  , to   $7.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $8.1 billion   at   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in AUM is due to net outflows for the twelve months ending   September 30, 2016   of $0.8 billion and disposed AUM of $0.5 billion, partially offset by positive market action of $0.6 billion.  
  The Company s Investment Management segment reported net income attributable to the Company of   $1.3 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , compared to net income attributable to the Company of   $1.5 million   for the same period of   2015  . The 10% decrease was due primarily to a 6% decrease in revenue, partially offset by an 4% decrease in operating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreased variable and incentive compensation, decreased intangible amortization expense, and decreased business development expense. Most fee-based revenue is determined based on beginning-of-period AUM data. Investment Management AUM increased   $0.3 billion  , or   4%  , to   $10.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $9.8 billion   at   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to positive market action of $1.3 billion for the twelve months ending   September 30, 2016  , partially offset  by net outflows of $1.0 billion. 
  The Company s Wealth Advisory segment reported net income attributable to the Company of   $1.8 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , compared to net income attributable to the Company of   $1.6 million   for the same period of   2015  . The 15% increase was due to a 2% increase in wealth advisory fee revenue and a 4% decrease in operating expenses, primarily due to decreased marketing and business development expense. Wealth Advisory AUM increased   $0.5 billion  , or   5%  , to   $10.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $9.5 billion   at   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to positive market action of $0.6 billion for the twelve months ending   September 30, 2016  , partially offset by net outflows of $0.1 billion. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes that its most critical accounting policies upon which its financial condition depends, and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are the allowance for loan and lease losses, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and analysis for impairment, and tax estimates. These policies are discussed in Part II. Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . There have been no changes to these policies through the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Financial Condition 
    
  Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Discussion 

_____________________ 
  nm     not meaningful 
  Total Assets.   Total assets   increased   2% to   $7.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $7.5 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . This increase was due primarily to increases in total loans and investments. 
  Cash and Investments.   Total cash and investments (consisting of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, and stock in the FHLBs)   decreased     $22.6 million  , or   2%  , to   $1.5 billion  , or   19%   of total assets at   September 30, 2016   from   $1.5 billion  , or   20%   of total assets, at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease was due to the   $171.1 million  , or   72%  , decrease in cash and cash equivalents, and the   $17.5 million  , or   15%  , decrease in held-to-maturity investments, partially offset by the   $165.1 million  , or   15%  , increase in available-for-sale investment securities. The change in cash and cash equivalents is the net result of short-term fluctuations in liquidity due to changes in levels of deposits, borrowings and loans outstanding.  
  The majority of the investments held by the Company are held by the Bank. The Bank s investment policy requires management to maintain a portfolio of securities which will provide liquidity necessary to facilitate funding of loans, to cover deposit fluctuations, and to mitigate the Bank s overall balance sheet exposure to interest rate risk, while at the same time earning a satisfactory return on the funds invested. The securities in which the Bank may invest are subject to regulation and are generally limited to securities that are considered  investment grade.   
  Investment maturities, calls, principal payments, and sales of securities from the Company s available-for-sale investment portfolio provided   $190.1 million   of cash proceeds during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The timing of sales and reinvestments is based on various factors, including management s evaluation of interest rate trends, the credit risk of municipal securities and the Company s liquidity. The Company s available-for-sale investment portfolio carried a total of   $22.4 million   of unrealized gains and   $1.8 million   of unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $7.6 million   of unrealized gains and   $7.2 million   of unrealized losses at   December 31, 2015  .  
  No impairment losses were recognized through earnings related to investment securities during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The total amount of unrealized losses was primarily due to changes in interest rates since the securities were purchased. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no intent to sell any securities in an unrealized loss  
  
    46 

position at that date and it is not more likely than not that the Company would be forced to sell any of these securities prior to the full recovery of all unrealized losses. 
  See Part I. Item 1.  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4: Investments  for further details of the Company s investment securities.  
  Loans held for sale.   Loans held for sale   decreased     $2.8 million  , or   34%  , to   $5.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $8.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The balance of loans held for sale is usually related to the timing and volume of residential loans originated for sale and the ultimate sale transaction, which is typically executed within a short time following the loan origination.  
  Goodwill and intangible assets, net.   Goodwill and intangible assets   decreased     $4.7 million  , or   3%  , to   $180.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $185.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease was due to amortization of intangible assets.  
  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets such as trade names are subject to annual impairment tests, or more frequently, if there is indication of impairment, based on guidance in ASC 350,   Intangibles-Goodwill and Other  . Long-lived intangible assets such as advisory contracts are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360,   Property, Plant, and Equipment   ( ASC 360 ). 
  Management performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2015 for applicable reporting units. The estimated fair value for all applicable reporting units exceeded the carrying value, and as a result no impairment was evident. There was no additional testing required for long-lived intangible assets in 2015. 
  The goodwill impairment testing as of October 31, 2015 indicated that the reporting units with the closest fair values as compared to carrying value were Anchor and Boston Private Wealth. The estimated fair value of Anchor was $92.0 million as compared to a carrying value of $82.8 million, an excess of $9.2 million, or 11.2%. The estimated fair value of Boston Private Wealth was $85.0 million as compared to a carrying value of $71.5 million, an excess of $13.5 million, or 18.9%. 
  The October 31, 2015 fair values for Anchor and Boston Private Wealth were determined based on their actual and forecasted earnings as well as market comparisons for these types of firms. The Company has monitored changes in the assumptions and inputs in the valuation models, such as AUM, discount rates, and actual and forecasted earnings for indications of a triggering event that would have required the immediate testing for goodwill impairment. The Company concluded that no triggering event occurred since the last testing date that would have required interim goodwill impairment testing.   
  Although the Company concluded that no triggering events occurred since the last testing date, both Anchor and Boston Private Wealth s actual results were unfavorable as compared to the assumptions used in the October 31, 2015 valuation. Anchor s AUM net outflows were higher than forecasted although the positive market impact was also higher than forecasted which offset the increased outflows. Boston Private Wealth s net outflows were significantly higher than forecast although the positive market impact helped offset some of the outflows it was not enough to offset the negative flows. As a result of the decline in AUM, Boston Private Wealth s financial results have been unfavorable as compared to was forecasted in the October 31, 2015 valuation.  
  The Company will again be performing its annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter. The Company will take into consideration partial fourth quarter results as well as changes in market conditions for both Anchor and Boston Private Wealth in preparing the forecasts used in the 2016 impairment testing. 
  Total other assets.   Total other assets, as presented in the table above, consists of the following line items from the consolidated balance sheet: other real estate owned ( OREO ), premises and equipment, fees receivable, accrued interest receivable, deferred income taxes, net, and other assets. Total other assets   increased     $18.0 million  , or   8%  , to   $251.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $233.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase was the result of increases in other assets partially offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes, net. 
  Other assets, which consist primarily of bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI ), prepaid expenses, investments in partnerships, the fair value of interest rate derivatives, and other receivables,   increased     $28.2 million  , or   23%  , to   $149.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $121.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in the fair value of non-hedging derivative instruments and an increase in partnership investments, and partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable.  
  Deferred income taxes, net, decreased   $12.4 million  , or   24%  , to   $39.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $51.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to current year deferred tax expense and the current year tax  
  
    47 

effect of other comprehensive income. At September 30, 2016, no valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset was required, other than for capital losses, based upon the ability to generate future taxable income as well as the availability of current and historical taxable income. 
  Deposits.   Total deposits   decreased     $228.2 million  , or   4%  , to   $5.8 billion  , at   September 30, 2016   from   $6.0 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . At September 30, 2016, the Company classified   $105.8 million   of deposits as held for sale related to the announced sale of two offices in Southern California. Deposit balances also decreased during the first   nine months   of   2016   due to lower money markets, certificates of deposit, and NOW deposits. Deposit levels can fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of large short-term transactions by commercial clients. Seasonality can also affect the deposit balances.  
  The following table presents the composition of the Company s deposits at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

_____________________ 
           (1) 
    Includes brokered deposits. 
      Borrowings.   Total borrowings (consisting of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, federal funds purchased, if any, FHLB borrowings, and junior subordinated debentures)   increased     $205.6 million  , or   33%  , to   $831.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $625.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Repurchase agreements   increased     $19.3 million  , or   33%  , to   $77.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $58.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Repurchase agreements are generally linked to commercial demand deposit accounts with an overnight sweep feature. Federal funds purchased increased to   $125.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   none   outstanding at   December 31, 2015  . From time to time, the Bank purchases federal funds from the FHLB and other banking institutions to supplement its liquidity position. FHLB borrowings   increased     $61.4 million  , or   13%  , to   $522.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $461.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . FHLB borrowings are generally used to provide additional funding for loan growth when it is in excess of deposit growth and to manage interest rate risk, but can also be used as an additional source of liquidity for the Bank. Junior subordinated debentures remained flat at $106.4 million.  
  Total other liabilities.   Total other liabilities, which consist primarily of accrued interest, accrued bonus, the fair value of interest rate derivatives, and other accrued expenses,   increased     $22.9 million  , or   21%  , to   $134.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $111.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to increases in the fair value of derivative liability instruments. These increases were partially offset by decreases in accrued expenses, particularly accrued compensation, bonuses and employee benefits, as well as decreases in federal income tax payable. 

Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality 
  Loans  . Total portfolio loans increased $150.3 million, or 3%, to   $5.9 billion  , or   76%  , of total assets as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $5.7 billion  , or   76%  , of total assets as of   December 31, 2015  . Increases were recorded in commercial real estate loans of $140.4 million, or 7%, residential loans of   $86.6 million  , or   4%  , and home equity and other consumer loans of $20.4 million, or   7%  , partially offset by decreases in construction and land loans of $84.7 million, or   46%  , and commercial and industrial loans of $12.4 million, or 1%.  
  
    48 

The Bank specializes in lending to individuals, real estate investors, and middle market businesses, including corporations, partnerships, associations and nonprofit organizations. Loans made by the Bank to individuals may include residential mortgage loans and mortgage loans on investment or vacation properties, unsecured and secured personal lines of credit, home equity loans, and overdraft protection. Loans made by the Bank to businesses include commercial and mortgage loans, revolving lines of credit, working capital loans, equipment financing, community lending programs, and construction and land loans. The types and sizes of loans the Bank originates are limited by regulatory requirements. 
  The Bank s loans are affected by the economic and real estate markets in which they are located. Generally, commercial real estate, construction, and land loans are affected more than residential loans in an economic downturn. 
     Geographic concentration.   The following table presents the Company s outstanding loan balance concentrations at   September 30, 2016   based on the location of the regional offices to which they are attributed.  

Allowance for loan losses  . The allowance for loan losses is reported as a reduction of outstanding loan balances and totaled   $77.7 million   and   $78.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  The allowance for loan losses as of   September 30, 2016     decreased   $0.8 million, or 1%, from   December 31, 2015   due to a decline in the loss factors, partially offset by the mix in the loan portfolio and an increase in criticized loans. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans   decreased     5   basis point to   1.32%   as of   September 30, 2016   from   1.37%   as of   December 31, 2015  . The decrease in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans is due to the combination of the mix in the loan portfolio, loan growth, and the change in the volume and type of criticized loans. See Part I. Item 1.  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 7: Allowance for Loan Losses  for an analysis of the Company s allowance for loan losses. 
  An analysis of the risk in the loan portfolio as well as management judgment is used to determine the estimated appropriate amount of the allowance for loan losses. The Company s allowance for loan losses is comprised of three primary components (general reserves, allocated reserves on non-impaired special mention and substandard loans, and allocated reserves on impaired loans). See Part II. Item 8.  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6: Allowance for Loan Losses  and the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for further information.  
  The following table presents a summary of loans charged-off, net of recoveries, by geography for the periods indicated. The geography assigned to the data is based on the location of the regional offices to which the loans are attributed. 

Net recoveries of $2.1 million were recorded in the   third quarter   of   2016  , compared to $1.6 million of net charge-offs for the same period of   2015  . Despite the current year net recoveries on previously charged-off commercial loans (which include construction and land loans, commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans), the Company believes that commercial loans represent the greatest risk of loss due to the size and nature of these loans and the related collateral. Local  
  
    49 

economic and business conditions in the markets where our offices are located have a significant impact on our commercial loan customers and their ability to service their loans. Of the $5.0 million in net recoveries recorded in the first   nine months   of   2016  , $5.7 million related to commercial real estate loans and $0.7 million related to construction and land loans, partially offset by net charge-offs of $0.9 million related to commercial and industrial loans and $0.5 million related to residential loans. 
  Nonperforming assets.   The Company s nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and OREO. OREO consists of real estate acquired through foreclosure proceedings and real estate acquired through acceptance of deeds in lieu of foreclosure. As of   September 30, 2016  , nonperforming assets totaled $18.3 million, or   0.24%   of total assets, a decrease of $9.0 million, or 33%, compared to   $27.3 million  , or   0.36%   of total assets, as of   December 31, 2015  .  
  The Bank s policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest on a loan when the collectability of principal or interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement is in doubt. Despite a loan having a current payment status, if the Bank has reason to believe it may not collect all principal and interest on the loan in accordance with the related contractual terms, the Bank will generally discontinue the accrual of interest income and will apply any future interest payments received to principal. Of the   $16.5 million   of loans on nonaccrual status as of   September 30, 2016  , $7.2 million, or   44%  , had a current payment status, $1.7 million, or   10%  , were 30-89 days past due, and $7.6 million, or   46%  , were 90 days or more past due. Of the $26.6 million of loans on nonaccrual status as of December 31, 2015, $8.0 million, or 30%, had a current payment status, $0.9 million, or 3%, were 30-89 days past due, and $17.7 million, or 67%, were 90 days or more past due.  
  The Bank continues to evaluate the underlying collateral of each nonperforming loan and pursue the collection of interest and principal. Where appropriate, the Bank obtains updated appraisals on collateral. Reductions in fair values of the collateral for nonaccrual loans, if they are collateral dependent, could result in additional future provision for loan losses depending on the timing and severity of the decline. See Part I. Item 1.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6: Loans Receivable  for further information on nonperforming loans. 
  The Bank s policy for returning a loan to accrual status requires the loan to be brought current and for the client to show a history of making timely payments (generally six consecutive months). For nonaccruing troubled debt restructured loans ( TDRs ), a return to accrual status generally requires timely payments for a period of six months in accordance with restructured terms, along with meeting other criteria.  
  Delinquencies.   The past due status of a loan is determined in accordance with its contractual repayment terms.  All loan types are reported past due when one scheduled payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. Loans 30-89 days past due decreased $8.5 million, or 65%, to   $4.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   from $13.1 million as of   December 31, 2015  . Loan delinquencies can be attributed to many factors, such as continuing weakness in, or deteriorating, economic conditions in the region the collateral is located, the loss of a tenant or lower lease rates for commercial borrowers, or the loss of income for consumers and the resulting liquidity impacts on the borrowers. Further deterioration in the credit condition of these delinquent loans could lead to the loans going to nonaccrual status and/or being downgraded. Downgrades would generally result in additional provision for loan losses. Past due loans may be included with accruing substandard loans. 
  In certain instances, although very infrequently, loans that have become 90 days or more past due may remain on accrual status if the value of the collateral securing the loan is sufficient to cover principal and interest and the loan is in the process of collection. There were no loans 90 days or more past due, but still accruing, respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Impaired Loans.   When management determines that it is probable that the Bank will not collect all principal and interest on a loan in accordance with the original loan terms, the loan is considered impaired. Certain impaired loans may continue to accrue interest based on factors such as the restructuring terms, if any, the historical payment performance, the value of collateral, and the financial condition of the borrower. Impaired commercial loans and impaired construction loans are typically, in accordance with ASC 310, individually evaluated for impairment. Large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans may be collectively evaluated for impairment. Such groups of loans may include, but are not limited to, residential loans, home equity loans, and consumer loans. However, if the terms of any of such loans are modified in a troubled debt restructuring, then such loans would be individually evaluated for impairment in the allowance for loan and lease losses.  
  Loans that are individually evaluated for impairment require an analysis to determine the amount of impairment, if any. For collateral dependent loans, impairment would be indicated as a result of the carrying value of the loan exceeding the estimated collateral value, less costs to sell, or, for loans not considered to be collateral dependent, the net present value of the projected cash flow, discounted at the loan s contractual effective interest rate. Generally, when a collateral dependent loan becomes impaired, an updated appraisal of the collateral, if appropriate, is obtained. If the impaired loan has not been upgraded to a performing status within a reasonable amount of time, the Bank will continue to obtain updated appraisals, as deemed necessary, especially during periods of declining property values. Normally, shortfalls in the analysis of collateral dependent  
  
    50 

loans would result in the impairment amount being charged-off to the allowance for loan losses. Shortfalls on cash flow dependent loans may be carried as specific allocations to the general reserve unless a known loss is determined to have occurred, in which case such known loss is charged-off. Based on the impairment analysis, the provision could be higher or lower than the amount of provision associated with a loan prior to its classification as impaired. See Part II. Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for detail on the Company s treatment of impaired loans in the allowance for loan losses. 
   Impaired loans individually evaluated for impairment in the allowance for loan losses totaled   $38.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , a   decrease   of $0.7 million, or   2%  , compared to   $39.2 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , $14.1 million of the individually evaluated impaired loans had   $1.3 million   in specific reserve allocations. The remaining $24.4 million of individually evaluated impaired loans did not have specific reserve allocations due to the adequacy of collateral, prior charge-offs taken, interest collected and applied to principal, or a combination of these items. As of   December 31, 2015  ,   $15.9 million   of individually evaluated impaired loans had   $1.6 million   in specific reserve allocations, and the remaining   $23.3 million   of individually evaluated impaired loans did not have specific reserve allocations.  
  The Bank may, under certain circumstances, restructure loans as a concession to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Such loans are classified as TDRs and are included in impaired loans. TDRs typically result from the Bank s loss mitigation activities which, among other things, could include rate reductions, payment extensions, and/or principal forgiveness. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , TDRs totaled $30.6 million. As of   September 30, 2016  , $26.1 million of the $30.6 million of TDRs were on accrual status. As of   December 31, 2015  , $18.6 million of the $30.6 million of TDRs were on accrual status.  
  Potential Problem Loans.   Loans that evidence weakness or potential weakness related to repayment history, the borrower s financial condition, or other factors are reviewed by the Bank s management to determine if the loan should be adversely classified. Delinquent loans may or may not be adversely classified depending upon management s judgment with respect to each individual loan. The Bank classifies certain loans as  substandard,   doubtful,  or  loss  based on criteria consistent with guidelines provided by banking regulators. Potential problem loans consist of accruing substandard loans where known information about possible credit problems of the related borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in classification of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future. Management cannot predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or other factors which may impact borrowers and the potential problem loans. Triggering events for loan downgrades include updated appraisal information, inability of borrowers to cover debt service payments, loss of tenants or notification by the tenant of non-renewal of lease, inability of borrowers to sell completed construction projects, and the inability of borrowers to sell properties. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that other loans will not become 90 days or more past due, be placed on nonaccrual, be restructured, or require increased allowance coverage and provision for loan losses.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank has identified   $88.1 million   in potential problem loans, an   increase   of $29.7 million, or 51%, compared to $58.4 million as of   December 31, 2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to the downgrade of two commercial real estate loans made to a single borrower in the Southern California region. Numerous factors impact the level of potential problem loans including economic conditions and real estate values. These factors affect the borrower s liquidity and, in some cases, the borrower s ability to comply with loan covenants such as debt service coverage. When there is a loss of a major tenant in a commercial real estate building, the appraised value of the building generally declines. Loans may be downgraded when this occurs as a result of the additional risk to the borrower in obtaining a new tenant in a timely manner and negotiating a lease with similar or better terms than the previous tenant. In many cases, these loans are still current and paying as agreed, although future performance may be impacted.

The following table presents a summary of credit quality by loan type. The loan type assigned to the credit quality data is based on the purpose of the loan. 

Liquidity  
  Liquidity is defined as the Company s ability to generate adequate cash to meet its needs for day-to-day operations and material long and short-term commitments. Liquidity risk is the risk of potential loss if the Company were unable to meet its funding requirements at a reasonable cost. The Company manages its liquidity based on demand, commitments, specific events and uncertainties to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. The Company s objective in managing liquidity is to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers as well as to earnings enhancement opportunities in a changing marketplace. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s cash and cash equivalents amounted to   $67.6 million  . The Holding Company s cash and cash equivalents amounted to $53.0 million at   September 30, 2016  . Management believes that the Holding Company and its affiliates, including the Bank, have adequate liquidity to meet their commitments for the foreseeable future. 
  Management is responsible for establishing and monitoring liquidity targets as well as strategies to meet these targets. At both   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, consolidated cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, less securities pledged against current borrowings and derivatives, amounted to $1.2 billion, or 16% of total assets. Future loan growth may depend upon the Company s ability to continue to grow its core deposit levels. In addition, the Company has access to available borrowings through the FHLB totaling $1.1 billion as of   September 30, 2016   compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Combined, this liquidity totals $2.3 billion, or 30% of assets and 39% of total deposits, as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to $2.4 billion, or 31% of assets and 39% of total deposits, at December 31, 2015.

The Bank has various internal policies and guidelines regarding liquidity, both on- and off-balance sheet, loans to assets ratio, and limits on the use of wholesale funds. These policies and/or guidelines require certain minimum or maximum balances or ratios be maintained at all times. In light of the provisions in the Bank s internal liquidity policies and guidelines, the Bank will carefully manage the amount and timing of future loan growth along with its relevant liquidity policies and balance sheet guidelines. 
  Holding Company Liquidity.   The Company and some of the Company s majority-owned affiliates hold put and call options that would require the Company to purchase (and the noncontrolling interest owners of the majority-owned affiliates to sell) the remaining noncontrolling interests in these companies at either a contractually predetermined fair value, a multiple of EBITDA, or fair value, as determined by the respective agreements. At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated maximum redemption value for these affiliates related to outstanding put options, on an aggregate basis, was   $16.2 million  , all of which could be redeemed within the next 12 months, under certain circumstances, and is classified on the consolidated balance sheets as RNCI. These put and call options are discussed in detail in Part II. Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14: Noncontrolling Interests  of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
  The Holding Company s primary sources of funds are dividends from its affiliates and access to the capital and debt markets. The Holding Company recognized   $4.4 million   in net income from discontinued operations during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   related to a revenue sharing agreement with Westfield Capital Management Company, LLC ( Westfield ). The terms of this revenue sharing agreement are discussed in detail in Part II. Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3: Acquisitions, Asset Sales, and Divestitures  of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Other than the revenue sharing agreement with Westfield, divestitures are not ongoing sources of funds for the Holding Company. Dividends from the Bank are limited by various regulatory requirements relating to capital adequacy and retained earnings. See Part II. Item 5.  Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters, and Issuers Purchases of Equity Securities  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further details. 
  The Bank pays dividends to the Holding Company, subject to the approval of the Bank s board of directors, depending on its profitability and asset growth. If regulatory agencies were to require banks to increase their capital ratios, or impose other restrictions, it may limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Holding Company and/or limit the amount that the Bank could grow. 
  Although the Bank s capital currently exceeds regulatory requirements for capital, the Holding Company could downstream additional capital to increase the rate that the Bank could grow. Depending upon the amount of capital downstreamed by the Holding Company, the approval of the Holding Company s board of directors may be required prior to the payment, if any. 
  The Company is required to pay interest quarterly on its junior subordinated debentures. The estimated cash outlay for the   remaining three months of 2016   for the interest payments is approximately $0.6 million based on the debt outstanding and estimated LIBOR as of the date of this filing. 
  The Company is required to pay cash dividends quarterly on its Series D preferred stock, issued in April 2013, at 6.95% per annum. The estimated cash outlay for the   remaining three months of 2016   for the Series D preferred stock dividend payments is approximately $0.9 million. Although the rate of interest is set in the terms of the preferred stock, the quarterly preferred stock dividend payments are subject to approval by the Company s board of directors. 
  The Company presently plans to pay cash dividends on its common stock on a quarterly basis dependent upon a number of factors such as profitability, Holding Company liquidity, and the Company s capital levels. However, the ultimate declaration of dividends by the board of directors of the Company will depend on consideration of, among other things, recent financial trends and internal forecasts, regulatory limitations, alternative uses of capital deployment, general economic conditions, and regulatory changes to capital requirements. In January 2016, the Company increased its quarterly dividend from $0.09 per share to $0.10 per share. Based on the current dividend rate and estimated shares outstanding, the Company estimates the amount to be paid out in the   remaining three months of 2016   for dividends to common shareholders will be approximately $8.2 million. The estimated dividend payments in 2016 could increase or decrease if the Company s board of directors voted to increase or decrease, respectively, the current dividend rate, and/or the number of shares outstanding changes significantly. 
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company s board of directors approved, and received regulatory non-objection for, a share repurchase program of up to $20 million of the Company s outstanding common shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market for a two-year period. The Company estimates the dollar amount of common stock to be repurchased in the   remaining three months of 2016   will be approximately $3.8 million, although this estimate could vary depending on the price of the Company s common stock.  
  
    54 

Bank Liquidity.   The Bank has established various borrowing arrangements to provide additional sources of liquidity and funding. Management believes that the Bank currently has adequate liquidity available to respond to current demands. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Boston, and as such, has access to short- and long-term borrowings from that institution. The FHLB can change the advance amounts that banks can utilize based on a bank s current financial condition as obtained from publicly available data such as FDIC Call Reports. Decreases in the amount of FHLB borrowings available to the Bank would lower its liquidity and possibly limit the Bank s ability to grow in the short-term. Management believes that the Bank has adequate liquidity to meet its commitments for the foreseeable future.  
  In addition to the above liquidity, the Bank has access to the Federal Reserve discount window facility, which can provide short-term liquidity as  lender of last resort,  brokered deposits, and federal funds lines. The use of non-core funding sources, including brokered deposits and borrowings, by the Bank may be limited by regulatory agencies. Generally, the regulatory agencies prefer that banks rely on core-funding sources for liquidity.  
  From time to time, the Bank purchases federal funds from the FHLB and other banking institutions to supplement its liquidity position. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had unused federal fund lines of credit totaling $465.0 million with correspondent institutions to provide it with immediate access to overnight borrowings, compared to $565.0 million at December 31, 2015. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had $100.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the federal fund lines with these correspondent institutions along with an additional $25.0 million of outstanding borrowings under federal fund lines with the FHLB. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had   no   outstanding borrowings under these federal fund lines.  
  The Bank has also negotiated brokered deposit agreements with several institutions that have nationwide distribution capabilities. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had $564.7 million of brokered deposits (net of premiums paid) outstanding under these agreements, compared to $577.4 million at December 31, 2015. 
  If the Bank is no longer able to utilize the FHLB for borrowing, collateral currently used for FHLB borrowings could be transferred to other facilities such as the Federal Reserve s discount window. In addition, the Bank could increase its usage of brokered deposits. Other borrowing arrangements may have higher rates than the FHLB would typically charge. 

Capital Resources 
  Total shareholders  equity at   September 30, 2016   was   $781.5 million  , compared to   $746.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  , an increase of   $34.9 million  , or   5%  . The increase in shareholders  equity was primarily the result of net income and the change in other comprehensive income, partially offset by dividends paid and the repurchase of common stock.  
  As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. For example, under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory guidelines. The Bank s capital and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Similarly, the Company is also subject to capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve with respect to certain non-banking activities, including adjustments in connection with off-balance sheet items.  
  Effective January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank adopted the BASEL III regulatory capital framework. Under BASEL III, the Company and the Bank were required to implement a new risk-weighted capital measure Common Equity Tier I ( CETI ) as well as a phased in capital conservation buffer. In addition, capital requirements for all banking organizations were increased. In order to avoid limitations on distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a capital conservation buffer must be held above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The new rules are phased-in through 2019. The Bank and Company were in compliance with all of the requirements of the capital conservation buffer as of September 30, 2016. 
  To be categorized as  well capitalized,  the Company and the Bank must maintain specified minimum capital ratios. In addition, the Company and the Bank cannot be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive or prompt corrective action to be considered  well capitalized.  Both the Company and the Bank maintained capital at levels that would be considered  well capitalized  as of   September 30, 2016   under the applicable regulations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy required us to maintain minimum ratios of CETI, Tier 1, and total capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the regulations) and of Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined in the regulations).  
  
    55 

The following table presents the Company s and the Bank s amounts of regulatory capital and related ratios as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. Also presented are the minimum requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC as of those dates for the Company and the Bank, respectively, to meet applicable capital requirements and the requirements of the FDIC as of those dates for the Bank to be considered  well capitalized  under the FDIC s prompt corrective action provisions. 
  The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Massachusetts Division of Banks may impose higher capital ratios than those listed below based upon the results of regulatory exams. The Bank was categorized as  well capitalized  under the FDIC s prompt corrective action provisions as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015.

    Required capital ratios under the Basel III capital rules with the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer added to the minimum risk-based capital ratios .  The fully phased-in ratios are effective for 2019, with lower requirements during the transition years 2016 through 2018. 
     Bank regulatory authorities restrict the Bank from lending or advancing funds to, or investing in the securities of, the Company. Further, these authorities restrict the amounts available for the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has sponsored the creation of two statutory trusts for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds in junior subordinated debentures of the Company. In accordance with ASC 810-10-55,   Consolidation - Overall - Implementation Guidance and Illustrations - Variable Interest Entities  , these statutory trusts created by the Company are not consolidated into the Company s financial statements; however, the Company reflects the amounts of junior subordinated debentures payable to the preferred stockholders of statutory trusts as debt in its financial statements. As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , all $100.0 million of the net balance of these trust preferred securities qualified as Tier 1 capital.  

Results of operations   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015    
  Net Income.   The Company recorded net income from continuing operations   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $19.7 million   and   $52.7 million  , respectively, compared to   $13.2 million   and   $48.5 million   for the same respective periods in   2015  . Net income attributable to the Company, which includes income from both continuing and discontinued operations,   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $19.6 million   and   $54.1 million  , respectively, compared to   $13.5 million   and   $49.9 million   for the same respective periods in   2015  . 
  The Company recognized diluted EPS attributable to common shareholders, which includes both continuing and discontinued operations,   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $0.22   per share and   $0.62   per share, respectively, compared to   $0.16   per share and   $0.58   per share, respectively, for the same periods in   2015  . 
  Net income from continuing operations in both   2016   and   2015   was offset by charges that reduce income available to common shareholders. See Part I. Item 1.  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2: Earnings Per Share  for further detail on these charges to income available to common shareholders. 
  The following discussions are based on the Company s continuing operations, unless otherwise stated. 
  The following table presents selected financial highlights: 

Net interest income  . Net interest income represents the difference between interest earned, primarily on loans and investments, and interest paid on funding sources, primarily deposits and borrowings. Interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on total interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities. Net Interest Margin ( NIM ) is calculated by taking annualized net interest income for the period, on a fully taxable-equivalent ( FTE ) basis, as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The average rate earned on earning assets is the amount of annualized taxable equivalent interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities is equal to annualized interest expense as a percentage of average interest-bearing liabilities. When credit quality declines and loans are placed on nonaccrual status, NIM can decrease because the same assets are earning less income. Loans graded as substandard but still accruing interest income totaled   $88.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and could be placed on nonaccrual status if their credit quality declines further.  
  
    57 

Net interest income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $49.9 million  , an increase of   $3.4 million  , or   7%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , net interest income was   $148.9 million  , an increase of   $11.3 million  , or   8%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase for the three and   nine months   is due to higher volume of loans, higher volume and yields on cash and investments, and lower average rates paid on the Company s borrowings, partially offset by lower yields on loans and higher volume of borrowings and interest-bearing deposits. The NIM was   2.88%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of four basis points compared to the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the NIM was   2.92%  , an increase of one basis point compared to the same period in   2015  .  
  The following tables present the composition of the Company s NIM on a FTE basis for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  ; however, the discussion following these tables reflects non-FTE data.

              (4) 
    Includes deposits held for sale. 
     Interest and Dividend Income  . Interest and dividend income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     was   $56.6 million  , an increase of   $3.1 million  , or   6%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . Interest and dividend income for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $169.2 million  , an increase of   $10.9 million  , or   7%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase for the three and   nine months   was primarily due to higher loan volume, and higher volume and yields on cash and investments, partially offset by lower yields on loans.  
  The Bank generally has interest income that is either recovered or reversed related to nonaccrual loans each quarter. Based on the net amount recovered or reversed, the impact on interest income and related yields can be either positive or negative. In addition, the Bank collects prepayment penalties on certain commercial loans that pay off prior to maturity which could also impact interest income and related yields positively. The amount and timing of prepayment penalties varies from quarter to quarter. 
  Interest income on commercial and industrial loans, on a non-FTE basis, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     was   $8.9 million  , an increase of   $0.7 million  , or   8%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 4% increase in the average balance and a 12 basis point increase in the average yield. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , commercial interest income was   $27.3 million  , an increase of   $1.4 million  , or   6%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 9% increase in the average balance, partially offset by an 11 basis point decrease in the average yield. The increase in the average balance for the three and nine month periods is related to the organic growth of the commercial loan portfolio at the Bank, as discussed above in  Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality.  The decrease in the average yield for the three month period is the result of market conditions. The decrease in the average yield for the nine month period is the result of a lower level of recoveries on nonaccrual loans in 2016 than in 2015 as well as market conditions leading to lower rates due to competition for higher quality loans.  
  Interest income on commercial real estate loans for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $19.9 million  , an increase of   $0.5 million  , or   3%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 7% increase in the average balance, partially offset by a 15 basis point decrease in the average yield. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , commercial real estate interest income was   $59.2 million  , an increase of   $2.4 million  , or   4%  ,  compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 7% increase in the average balance, partially offset by an 11 basis point decrease in the average yield. The increase in the average balance for the three and nine month periods is related to the organic growth of the commercial real estate loan portfolio at the Bank. The decrease in the average yield for the three and nine month periods is the result of competitive market conditions leading to lower rates on new loans.  
  Interest income on construction and land loans for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.3 million  , a decrease of   $0.2 million  , or   12%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 29% decrease in the average balance, partially offset by an 81 basis point increase in the average yield. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , construction and land interest income was   $4.4 million  , an increase of   $0.6 million  , or   16%  ,  compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a flat average balance and a 53 basis point increase in the average yield. The decrease in the average balance for the three month period is related to customer demand. The increase in the average yield for the three and nine month periods is the result of market conditions.  
  Interest income on residential mortgage loans for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $17.8 million  , an increase of   $0.7 million  , or   4%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 4% increase in the average balance and a one basis point increase in the average yield. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , residential mortgage interest income was   $52.6 million  , an increase of   $2.2 million  , or   4%  ,  compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 4% increase in the average balance, with no change in the average yield. The increase in the average balances for the three and nine month periods is related to the organic growth of the residential loan portfolio at the Bank.  
  Interest income on home equity loans for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.1 million  , an increase of   $0.1 million  , or   11%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 5% increase in the average balance and a 18 basis point increase in the average yield. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , home equity interest income was   $3.3 million  , an increase of   $0.2 million  , or   6%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 4% increase in the average balance and a seven basis point increase in the average yield. The increase in the average balance for the three and nine month periods is related to the organic growth of the home equity loan portfolio at the Bank. The increase in the average yield for the three and nine month periods is the result of the increase in the Prime rate in December 2015.  
  
    61 

Interest income on other consumer loans for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.2 million  , an increase of   $0.2 million  , or   17%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 7% increase in the average balance and a 24 basis point increase in the average yield. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , other consumer interest income was   $3.2 million  , an increase of   $0.3 million  , or   10%  ,  compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 3% increase in the average balance and a 15 basis point increase in the average yield. The increase in the average yield for the three and nine month periods is primarily the result of the increase in the Prime rate in December 2015. The increase in the average balance for the three and nine month periods is primarily due to client demand.  
  Investment income, on a non-FTE basis, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $6.5 million  , an increase of   $1.1 million  , or   19%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 19 basis point increase in the average yield and a 7% increase in the average balance. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , investment income was   $19.4 million  , an increase of   $3.8 million  , or   24%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of an 11% increase in the average balance and a 19 basis point increase in the average yield. The increase in the average yield for the three and nine month periods is partially due to the increase in short-term interest rates in December 2015. The increase in the average balance for the three and nine month periods is primarily due to timing and volume of deposit balances as compared to the level of loans outstanding. Investment decisions are made based on anticipated liquidity, loan demand, and asset-liability management considerations. 
  Total interest expense  . Total interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $6.7 million  , a decrease of   $0.3 million  , or   4%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , total interest expense was   $20.3 million  , a decrease of   $0.4 million  , or   2%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $4.2 million  , an increase of   $0.2 million  , or   4%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a one basis point increase in the average rate paid, with no significant change in average balance. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , interest expense on deposits was   $12.4 million  , an increase of   $0.7 million  , or   6%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 3% increase in the average balance, and a one basis point increase in the average rate paid.  
  Interest paid on borrowings for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2.6 million  , a decrease of   $0.5 million  , or   16%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 143 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on junior subordinated debentures, and a 29 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on FHLB borrowings and other borrowings, partially offset by a 19% increase in the average balance of FHLB borrowings and other borrowings, with no change in the average balance of junior subordinated debentures. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , interest paid on borrowings was   $7.9 million  , a decrease of   $1.1 million  , or   12%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , as a result of a 143 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on junior subordinated debentures and a 23 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on FHLB borrowings and other borrowings, partially offset by a 19% increase in the average balance of FHLB borrowings and other borrowings, with no change in the average balance of junior subordinated debentures. The decrease for the three and nine month periods in the average rate paid on junior subordinated debentures is due to the December 30, 2015 expiration of the interest rate hedge on $75 million of the Company s floating rate junior subordinated debentures, after which the interest rate on that portion of the junior subordinated debentures was indexed to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.68%. The decrease for the three and nine month periods in the average rate paid on FHLB borrowings and other borrowings is due to the prepayment of higher rate FHLB debt in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.  
  Provision/ (credit) for loan losses.   The Company recorded a credit to the provision for loan losses of   $0.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a provision for loan losses of   $2.6 million   for the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the provision/ (credit) for loan losses was a credit of   $5.8 million  , compared to a provision of   $0.1 million   for the same period in   2015  . The credit to the provision for loan losses for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was the result of net recoveries and a decrease in loss factors, partially offset by an increase in criticized loans and loan growth. 
  The provision/ (credit) for loan losses is determined as a result of the required level of the allowance for loan losses, estimated by management, which reflects the inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet dates. The factors used by management to determine the level of the allowance for loan losses include the trends in problem loans, economic and business conditions, strength of management, real estate collateral values, and underwriting standards. For further details, see  Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality  above.  
  Fees and other income.   Fees and other income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $40.0 million  , an increase of   $0.6 million  , or   1%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .

    62 

on derivative agreements, offset by lower fee revenues in the Wealth Management and Trust and Investment Management segments due to decreases in AUM. Factors affecting the decrease in the nine month period include lower fee revenues in the Wealth Management and Trust and Investment Management segments due to decreases in AUM, and decreases in other income due to the 2015 Banyan Partners, LLC earnout adjustment which increased other income in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015. These decreases were offset by increases in banking fee income related to swap fees. 
  Investment management fee income for the three months ended    September 30, 2016   was   $10.7 million  , a decrease of    $0.6 million  , or   6%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , investment management fee income was   $32.0 million  , a decrease of   $2.8 million  , or   8%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .

The increase is primarily due to positive market action of $1.3 billion, partially offset by net outflows for the twelve months ending   September 30, 2016   of $1.0 billion.  
  Wealth advisory fee income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $12.8 million  , an increase of   $0.2 million  , or   2%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , wealth advisory fee income was   $38.0 million  , consistent with the same period in   2015  . AUM managed or advised by the Wealth Advisors was   $10.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $0.5 billion   compared to   September 30, 2015  . The increase is due to positive market action of $0.6 billion, partially offset by net outflows for the twelve months ending   September 30, 2016   of $0.1 billion. 
  Wealth management and trust fee income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $10.8 million  , a decrease of   $1.6 million  , or   13%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , wealth management and trust fee income was   $33.0 million  , a decrease of   $6.6 million  , or   17%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .

The decrease is due to net outflows for the twelve months ending   September 30, 2016   of $0.8 billion and disposed AUM of $0.5 billion, partially offset by positive market action of $0.6 billion. 
  Other banking fee income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $3.4 million  , an increase of    $0.7 million  , or   24%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , other banking fee income was   $9.7 million  , an increase of   $2.9 million  , or   44%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase for both the three and nine month periods is related to increases in swap fee income due to increased client demand for loan swap agreements.  
  Other income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.7 million  , an increase of   $1.7 million   compared to the same period in   2015  .

The three months ended September 30, 2016 included a gain on the fair value of derivative instruments of $1.2 million as well as miscellaneous income of $0.1 million and gain on rabbi trust investments of $0.2 million. The nine months ended September 30, 2016 included miscellaneous income of $0.9 million, and gain on rabbi trust investments of $0.5 million, partially offset by a loss on fair value of derivative investments of $0.9 million. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 included market value adjustments for the Banyan Partners, LLC earnout of $0.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The nine months ended September 30, 2015 also included gains on partnership investments of $0.8 million and miscellaneous income of $0.8 million.

Operating expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $61.7 million  , a decrease of   $0.3 million  , or consistent with compared to the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , operating expense was   $193.1 million  , an increase of   $5.3 million  , or   3%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . The changes for the three and nine months periods ended   September 30, 2016   are primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, marketing and business development, contract services, and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in professional services expense. Additionally, the Company incurred no restructuring charges in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and restructuring charges of   $2.0 million   related to Boston Private Wealth in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to restructuring charges of   $1.5 million   and   $1.7 million   for the three and nine month periods of 2015, respectively.  
  Salaries and employee benefits expense, the largest component of operating expense, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $40.9 million  , an increase of   $3.0 million  , or   8%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , salaries and employee benefits was   $124.1 million  , an increase of   $4.2 million  , or   4%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase for the three and nine month periods is primarily due to higher fixed compensation and, for the three month period, higher variable compensation costs and stock compensation. 
  
    63

The increase for the three and nine month periods is primarily due to an increase in telecommunications and technology expenses and an increase in rent expense due to new office locations. 
  Professional services expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2.3 million  , a decrease of   $0.6 million  , or   20%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .

The three month decrease is primarily related to a decrease in marketing expense in the Private Banking and Wealth Advisory segments.

  Contract services and data processing expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.9 million  , an increase of   $0.3 million  , or   17%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-04,   Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructuring by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40) - Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure  . The amendments to this update are intended to clarify when a creditor should be considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan such that the loan should be derecognized and the real estate recognized. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-09 ), amending the ASC and creating a new Topic 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   This issuance was part of the joint project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. The impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s consolidated financial statements is not yet known. Additionally, ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-09 ) was issued in August 2015 which defers adoption to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This update is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based plans such as income tax consequences, classification of awards as either liabilities or equity on the balance sheet, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years. Although early adoption is permitted, the Company does not plan on adopting prior to 2017. The Company does not expect that this ASU will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements although fluctuations in the Company s stock price between issuance date and settlement date of employee share-based transactions will lead to fluctuations in earnings once this ASU is implemented. 
  
    64 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . This ASU update is intended to increase transparency and comparability among companies by recognizing right of use lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods and is to be implemented utilizing a modified retrospective approach.  The Company expects that this ASU will gross up the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the lease assets and liabilities. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments (Topic 326)   ( ASU 2016-13 ). This update is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is available as of the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not plan on adopting early. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   ( ASU 2016-15 ). This update is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. The Company does not expect that this ASU will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

  CERTIFICATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

    I have reviewed this   quarterly report on Form 10-Q   of Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc. (the  registrant   
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;  
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:

              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.

              3.

              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and  
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
