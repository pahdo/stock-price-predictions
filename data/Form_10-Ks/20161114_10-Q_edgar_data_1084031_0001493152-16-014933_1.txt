1. Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going
concern. The Company has incurred significant recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. The Company
had a working capital deficiency of $862,571 and an accumulated deficit of $26,767,121 as of September 30, 2016. The Company also
has no lending relationships with commercial banks and is dependent on the completion of financings involving the private placement
of its securities in order to continue operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. The consolidated condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

The
Company does not anticipate establishing any lending relationships with commercial banks in the foreseeable future due to its
unprofitable operations and limited assets. The Company continues to execute its strategy of selling Excelyte   
and Catholyte Zero    to fund its operations and is focused on obtaining additional capital through the private
placement of its securities. The Company is pursuing potential equity and/or debt investors and, from time to time, has engaged
placement agents to assist it in this initiative. While the Company is pursuing the opportunities and actions described above,
there can be no assurance that it will be successful in its efforts. If the Company is unable to secure additional capital, it
will explore other strategic alternatives, including, but not limited to, the sale of the Company. Any additional equity financing
may result in substantial dilution to the Company s stockholders.  

2. Inventory   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, inventory consisted of parts and materials totaling $124,942 and $103,220, respectively.  

3. Property
and Equipment   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, property and equipment, on a net basis, consisted of the following:  

4. Accrued
Expenses   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued expenses consisted of the following:  

5. Convertible
Debentures   

April
2007 Convertible Debenture   

On
April 26, 2007, the Company issued a convertible debenture to an individual investor in the principal amount of $25,000. This
convertible debenture matured on January 2, 2009 and remains unpaid and, as a result, such obligation can be placed in default
by the holder. The convertible debenture accrues interest at a rate of 12% per annum and is convertible at any time into shares
of the Company s common stock at the option of the holder at a conversion price of $0.40 per share. An aggregate of 62,500
shares of the Company s common stock can be issued upon the conversion of the outstanding principal amount due on this convertible
debenture at the current conversion price of $0.40 per share.  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $756 and $2,252, respectively, of interest expense related
to this convertible debenture. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded $756 and $2,244, respectively,
of interest expense related to this convertible debenture. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the outstanding principal
on this convertible debenture was $25,000, which was included as a component of current convertible debentures, and the accrued
and unpaid interest was $18,694 and $16,441, respectively, which was included as a component of accrued expenses (see Note 4).

On
August 21, 2012, the Company issued to Zanett Opportunity Fund, Ltd. an 8% convertible debenture in the amount of $476,125 (the
 Zanett August 2012 Debenture ). The Zanett August 2012 Debenture bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum, had a
three-year term maturing on August 21, 2015 and was originally convertible into 4,761,250 of the Company s common stock
at a conversion price of $0.10 per share. Effective July 7, 2016, the Zanett August 2012 Debenture was amended to extend the maturity
date to December 31, 2017 and reduce the conversion price to $0.07 per share. As a result of this amendment, the Zanett August
2012 Debenture is convertible into 6,801,786 shares of the Company s common stock.  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $9,601 and $28,594, respectively, of interest expense
related to the Zanett August 2012 Debenture. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded $9,601
and $28,489, respectively, of interest expense related to the Zanett August 2012 Debenture. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding
principal on the Zanett August 2012 Debenture was $476,125, which was included as a component of non-current convertible debentures,
and the accrued and unpaid interest was $42,473, which was included as a component of accrued expenses (see Note 4). As of December
31, 2015, the outstanding principal on the Zanett August 2012 Debenture was $476,125, which was included as a component of current
convertible debentures, and the accrued and unpaid interest was $13,880, which was included as a component of accrued expenses
(see Note 4).  

November
and December 2015 Convertible Debentures and Warrants   

On
November 11, 2015, December 3, 2015 and December 18, 2015, the Company issued 12% convertible debentures (the  2015 Debentures )
in the aggregate principal amount of $997,222 to five institutional investors and three individual investors. In connection with
the issuance of the 2015 Debentures, the Company issued warrants (the  2015 Debenture Warrants ) to purchase an aggregate
of 7,123,014 shares of its common stock. The gross proceeds received in connection with these private placements were $897,500.  

The
2015 Debentures mature on the date that is two years from the issuance date, bear interest at a rate of 12% per annum and contain
an original issue discount of 10% of the principal amount ($99,722 in aggregate). The entire principal amount of each of the 2015
Debentures is convertible at any time into shares of the Company s common stock at the option of the respective debenture
holder at a conversion price of $0.07 per share. An aggregate of 14,246,029 shares of the Company s common stock can be
issued pursuant to the 2015 Debentures at the current conversion price of $0.07 per share.  

The
Company separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the 2015 Debentures based upon the relative fair value
of the liability and equity components on the respective dates of issuance. As a result, the Company recorded a discount of $117,708
for the 2015 Debentures to account for the relative fair value attributable to the 2015 Debenture Warrants, which is being accreted
as interest expense using the effective interest method over the respective two-year terms of each of the 2015 Debentures. In
addition, the $99,722 original issue discount is also being accreted as interest expense using the effective interest method over
the respective two-year terms of each of the 2015 Debentures.  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a total of $57,565 ($27,402 accreted) and $171,443 ($81,610
accreted), respectively, of interest expense related to the 2015 Debentures. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $98,699
and $8,867, respectively, of interest due on the 2015 Debentures was accrued and recorded as a component of accrued expenses (see
Note 4). As of September 30, 2016, the unamortized discount on the 2015 Debentures related to the fair value of the 2015 Debenture
Warrants was $68,513, the unamortized discount on the 2015 Debentures related to the original issue discount was $58,598 and the
net carrying value of the 2015 Debentures was $870,111, which was recorded as a component of non-current convertible debentures.
As of December 31, 2015, the net carrying value of the 2015 Debentures was $788,501, which was recorded as a component of non-current
convertible debentures.  

July
2016 Convertible Debentures and Warrants   

On
July 14, 2016, the Company issued zero coupon secured convertible debentures to eight individual investors and one institutional
investor (each a  July 2016 Debenture  and collectively, the  July 2016 Debentures ) in the aggregate
principal amount of $670,557. In connection with the issuance of the July 2016 Debentures, the Company issued warrants (the  July
2016 Debenture Warrants ) to purchase an aggregate of 67,055,700 shares of its common stock. The gross proceeds received
in connection with this private placement were $603,500.  

The
July 2016 Debentures have a one-year term maturing on July 14, 2017, contain an original issue discount of 10% and are secured
by the Company s assets. The entire principal amount of a July 2016 Debenture is convertible at any time into shares of
the Company s common stock at the option of the holder at a conversion price of $0.01 per share (the  July 2016 Debenture
Conversion Price ). If at any time subsequent to the issuance of the July 2016 Debentures and prior to the conversion of
the July 2016 Debentures into shares of the Company s common stock, the Company closes on a financing involving the issuance
of convertible debentures or shares of its common stock with or at a per share conversion price or purchase price that is less
than the July 2016 Debenture Conversion Price (the  Subsequent Financing Per Share Price ), then the July 2016 Debenture
Conversion Price will be reduced to seventy-five percent (75%) of the Subsequent Financing Per Share Price. The quoted market
price of the Company s common stock on July 14, 2016 was $0.009 per share. An aggregate of 67,055,700 shares of the Company s
common stock can be issued pursuant to the July 2016 Debentures at the current conversion price of $0.01 per share.  

The
July 2016 Debenture Warrants have a five-year term and provide the holders with the right to purchase an aggregate of 67,055,700
shares of the Company s common stock at $0.01 per share. All of the shares of the Company s common stock underlying
the July 2016 Debenture Warrants are fully vested. The July 2016 Debenture Warrants contain a cashless exercise provision and
are callable in the event the closing price of the Company s common stock averaged over a period of ten consecutive trading
days is equal to or greater than $0.04 per share. The exercise price of the July 2016 Debenture Warrants is subject to adjustment
for stock dividends, stock splits, or similar events.  

The
Company separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the July 2016 Debentures based upon the relative fair
value of the liability and equity components on the respective dates of issuance. As a result, the Company recorded a discount
of $294,794 for the July 2016 Debentures to account for the relative fair value attributable to the July 2016 Debenture Warrants,
which is being accreted as interest expense using the effective interest method over the one-year term of the July 2016 Debentures.
In addition, the $67,057 original issue discount is also being accreted as interest expense using the effective interest method
over the one-year term of the July 2016 Debentures.  

For
each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a total of $77,327 of accreted interest expense
related to the July 2016 Debentures. As of September 30, 2016, the unamortized discount on the July 2016 Debentures related to
the fair value of the July 2016 Debenture Warrants was $231,797, the unamortized discount on the July 2016 Debentures related
to the original issue discount was $52,727 and the net carrying value of the July 2016 Debentures was $386,033, which was recorded
as a component of current convertible debentures.  

6. Note
Payable   

On
May 9, 2016, the Company entered into a finance agreement with IPFS Corporation ( IPFS ). Pursuant to the terms of
this finance agreement, IPFS loaned the Company the principal amount of $24,650, which amount would accrue interest at a rate
of 9.6% per annum, in order to partially fund the payment of the premium of the Company s director and officer liability
insurance. The finance agreement requires the Company to make eleven monthly payments of $2,350, including interest, commencing
May 15, 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a total of $613 and $810, respectively,
of interest expense related to this finance agreement. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding principal balance related to
this finance agreement was $15,935 and the accrued and unpaid interest was $127, which was included as a component of accrued
expenses (see Note 4).

Stock
Options   

The
Company currently has two stock option/stock compensation plans in place: the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2012 Equity Incentive
Plan (collectively, the  Equity Incentive Plans ). The 2010 Stock Incentive Plan was approved by the stockholders
in September 2010. The Company had reserved for issuance an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of common stock under the 2010 Stock
Incentive Plan. As of September 30, 2016, stock options to purchase 3,846,920 shares of the Company s common stock were
outstanding under the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan and 90,500 shares of the Company s common stock had been issued under the

permitted under the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan.  

The
2012 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by the stockholders in May 2012. The original aggregate number of shares of common stock
which could be awarded under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan was 14,000,000 shares, subject to adjustment as provided in the 2012
Equity Incentive Plan. Effective January 29, 2016, as permitted under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, the Company s board
of directors increased the number of shares of common stock that could be awarded under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan to 31,140,458
shares. As of September 30, 2016, options to purchase 2,518,150 shares of the Company s common stock were outstanding under

stock options.  

A
summary of stock option transactions under the Equity Incentive Plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is set forth
below:

8. Stock-Based
Compensation   

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense as follows:  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to stock options
granted to employees of $1,716 and $5,108, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded
stock-based compensation expense related to common stock and stock options granted to employees and directors of $11,164 and $454,543,
respectively. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not record any stock-based
compensation expense for non-employees.  

9. Net
Loss Per Common Share   

Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect, in periods in which they have a dilutive effect, the
impact of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants and conversion of convertible debt that are not deemed
to be anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of the outstanding stock options and warrants is computed using the treasury stock method.  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, diluted net loss per share did not include the effect of 6,365,070 shares
of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, 93,093,734 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise
of outstanding warrants and 88,166,015 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of convertible debt, as their effect
would be anti-dilutive.  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, diluted net loss per share did not include the effect of 8,365,070 shares
of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, 19,315,811 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise
of outstanding warrants and 4,823,750 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of convertible debt, as their effect
would be anti-dilutive.  

Item 2.  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

General  

IET was originally incorporated in Delaware
on February 2, 1999 and is now a Nevada corporation. IET is headquartered in Little River, South Carolina and operates through
its wholly-owned subsidiary, I.E.T., Inc., a Nevada corporation incorporated on January 11, 2002. 

IET markets its products
and equipment under the umbrella brand name EcoTreatments   . IET produces a hypochlorous acid-based solution, commonly
known as anolyte, that it markets and sells under the brand name Excelyte   , as well as an anti-oxidizing, mildly
alkaline solution, commonly known as catholyte, that it markets under the brand name Catholyte Zero   . Both Excelyte   
and Catholyte Zero    provide an environmentally friendly and effective alternative for cleaning, sanitizing and
disinfecting as compared to the hazardous chemicals traditionally prevalent in commercial use. IET manufactures proprietary equipment,
which it markets under the brand name EcaFlo   , to produce Excelyte    and Catholyte Zero   
for distribution by IET and, under certain circumstances, such equipment is leased by IET to customers for use at their facilities. 

Products  

We produce Excelyte   ,
which is effective as a disinfectant without leaving a harmful residue. The naturally occurring properties and less-corrosive nature
of Excelyte    make it an excellent replacement for quaternary ammonia, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and other hazardous
chemicals traditionally used as biocides/disinfectants and sanitizers. Excelyte    contains an active killing agent
that is produced with a pH of 6.5 and contains a ratio of free available chlorine of approximately 92% hypochlorous acid to 8%
hypochlorite. 

Excelyte    is registered with
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the  EPA ) as a tuberculocidal hospital-level, hard non-porous surface disinfectant
(EPA Registration No. 82341-1). Our EPA registration for Excelyte    includes kill claims for: (1) various pathogens
including, but not limited to,  Mycobacterium bovis  (Tuberculosis),  Salmonella enterica ,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa ,
 Staphylococcus aureus , methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA), H1N1 influenza virus (swine flu) and Respiratory
Syncytial virus (RSV); (2) hospital-acquired pathogens such as  Clostridium difficile  spores ( C. diff ) and vancomycin-resistant
enterococci (VRE) as well as a carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) known as  Klebsiella pneumoniae  (NDM-1); (3)
high-risk blood-borne pathogen human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); (4) the food-borne pathogens  Listeria monocytogenes  and
 Escherichia coli  ( E. coli ); (5) Yeast,  Candida albicans ; and (6) the non-enveloped viruses adenovirus, norovirus,
rhinovirus and rotavirus. Our EPA registration for Excelyte    also includes approval for use in oil and gas applications
as a hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) scavenger/eliminator and biocide. Excelyte    is also registered with the EPA
(EPA Registration No. 82341-4) as a disinfectant to prevent Canine distemper virus, Canine parvovirus and  Bordetella bronchiseptica .
We intend to market the canine product, in conjunction with a third-party partner, as Excelyte    VET. 

We also produce Catholyte
Zero   , which is an anti-oxidizing, mildly alkaline solution that is effective as an industrial degreaser and surfactant.
We have recently developed a new proprietary oil well treatment protocol that consists of a dual treatment regimen utilizing both
Excelyte    and Catholyte Zero   . The protocol has significantly increased oil production, while substantially
reducing hydrogen sulfide, iron sulfide scales (FeS), bacteria and bacterial deposits present in oil wells. 

IET will also lease EcaFlo   
equipment to a customer in certain situations if the customer s business model and required volume of solution warrants such
an arrangement. Under this type of arrangement, we lease our EcaFlo    equipment and provide service support for a
fixed monthly amount plus royalty payments for the solution produced by the customer. We also license to certain customers the
right to utilize our intellectual property pursuant to which the customer is required to pay us a monthly fee based on the number
of gallons of solution produced by our EcaFlo    equipment. We currently have no active lease arrangements and have
one active license agreement. 

Business Strategy  

We seek long-term relationships
and commitments directly with our targeted customers and distributors. Our business model is focused on selling Excelyte   
and Catholyte Zero    directly to customers. In certain situations, a customer s business model and required
volume of solution may make it advantageous for us to place the EcaFlo    equipment at the customer s facility.
In these situations, we would lease the EcaFlo    equipment to the customer, maintaining ownership of the equipment. 

Currently, we are primarily
focused on selling large volumes of Excelyte    and Catholyte Zero    to the upstream oil and gas production
market (exploration and production companies), and the majority of our sales, marketing, research and development, and administrative
resources are dedicated to this endeavor. However, we also sell smaller volumes of Excelyte    to the healthcare and
food production markets, and we maintain long-term interest in developing these business segments further. 

Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates  

The discussion and analysis of the Company s
financial condition and results of operations are based upon the interim consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere
herein, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements required
us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad
debts, income taxes, contingencies and litigation. We based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The critical accounting estimates that we believe
affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere
herein are described in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies. 

Results of Operations   

Revenue.  Revenue for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 was $56,430, as compared to $141,665, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The $85,235, or 60%,
decrease in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily the result of a $77,790 decrease in Excelyte   
sales and a $7,021 decrease in sales of EcaFlo    equipment parts and related supplies. The $77,790 decrease in Excelyte   
sales was primarily the result of a $107,790 decrease in sales to two oil and gas customers who either reduced their well maintenance
budgets and/or closed down low-producing wells, offset by a $31,777 increase in sales to an existing customer that expanded Excelyte   
well maintenance treatments to additional wells in new basins. 

Revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $169,567, as compared to $449,287, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The $279,720, or 62%, decrease in
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily the result of a $245,787 decrease in Excelyte   
sales and a $29,640 decrease in sales of EcaFlo    equipment parts and related supplies. The $245,787 decrease in
Excelyte    sales was primarily the result of a $333,915 decrease in sales to two oil and gas customers who either

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a
working capital deficiency of $862,571 and cash on hand of $229,144. The $608,963 decrease in cash on hand from December 31, 2015
was primarily the result of payments to fund our continuing operating expenses, offset by the receipt of $137,500 of gross proceeds
from the sale of our common stock and the receipt of $603,500 of gross proceeds from the issuance of the July 2016 Debentures. 

During the past several years,
we generally sustained recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations. We currently do not generate sufficient revenue
from the sale of our products to fund our operations and have funded this shortfall through the sale of our common stock and the
issuance of convertible debentures. 

As of November 11, 2016,
our cash position was approximately $122,000. If we are not able to generate profitable operations from the sale of our products
or we are not able to obtain additional financing, we will only be able to continue our operations for approximately one months
from the filing date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We have and continue to reduce operating expenses and have also deferred
certain vendor payments until our cash flow position improves. We did not make a $25,000 principal payment due on a convertible
debenture and, as a result, this obligation can be placed into default by the holder. 

Our independent registered
public accounting firm included an emphasis of a matter paragraph in its report included in our annual report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015, which expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated
condensed financial statements included herein do not include any adjustments related to this uncertainty. 

We have no lending relationships with commercial
banks and are dependent on our ability to attain profitable operations and raise additional capital through one or more equity
and/or debt financings in order to continue operations. While we are working toward attaining profitability for our continuing
operations and pursuing potential equity and/or debt investors, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts.
From time to time, we engage placement agents to assist us in our financing initiatives. Any additional equity financing may result
in substantial dilution to our stockholders. If we are unable to attain profitable operations or secure additional capital, we
will explore strategic alternatives, including, but not limited to, the sale of the Company.

required to be disclosed in Company reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
and Secretary (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in internal control over financial
reporting  

Management reviews the Company s system
of internal control over financial reporting and makes changes to the Company s processes and systems to improve controls
and increase efficiency, while ensuring that the Company maintains an effective internal control environment. Changes may include
such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities and migrating processes. 

During the Company s last fiscal quarter,
there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
