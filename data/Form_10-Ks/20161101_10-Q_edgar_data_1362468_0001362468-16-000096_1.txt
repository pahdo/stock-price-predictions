ALLEGIANT TRAVEL COMPANY 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited) 

Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Allegiant Travel Company (the  Company ) and its majority-owned operating subsidiaries. The Company has no independent assets or operations, and all guarantees of the Company's publicly held debt are full and unconditional and joint and several. Investments in affiliates in which the Company s ownership interest ranges from   20   to   50   percent and in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for under the equity method. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
    
  These unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments which management believes are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for Form 10-Q. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and notes thereto included in the annual report of the Company on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, intended to create a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Under this ASU and subsequently issued amendments, the core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new standard, revenue related to certain air-related ancillary fees directly related to ticket revenue, such as seat fees and baggage fees, will likely no longer be considered distinct performance obligations separate from passenger travel. In addition, change fees previously recognized when received, will likely be recognized when air travel is provided. 
    
  The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, but not before December 15, 2016. The Company is evaluating the impact on its financial statements of adopting this new accounting standard. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, which amends the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The primary purpose of the ASU is to reduce the diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistency on this topic. The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect significant classification modifications as a result of this ASU. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 which is intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted the changes related to income taxes and cash flow presentation for excess tax benefits as of March 31, 2016 on a prospective basis, and prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted. The remaining provisions of this ASU do not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 related to leases. This standard will require leases with durations greater than twelve months to be recognized on the balance sheet, and is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company is assessing the impact of this new standard, specifically on  
  
   7 

its consolidated balance sheets, and does not expect adoption to significantly change the recognition, measurement or presentation of lease expense within the consolidated statements of income or cash flows.  

Note 2   Update to Accounting Policies 
    
  Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company's Airbus A320 series aircraft (and Boeing 757-200) had not experienced any major maintenance events, so a method to account for major maintenance events had not yet been applied. The first major maintenance events for the Airbus A320 series aircraft occurred during the second quarter 2016.  
    
  The Company accounts for major maintenance costs for its MD-80 airframes and the related JT8D-219 engines using the direct expense method. Under this method, major maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. The Company accounts for major maintenance costs for its Airbus airframes and the related CFM engines using the deferral method. Under this method, the Company capitalizes the cost of major maintenance events, which are amortized, as a component of depreciation and amortization expense, over the estimated period until the next scheduled major maintenance event. The Company has not experienced any major maintenance events for the Boeing 757-200 fleet. 
    
  On September 1, 2016, the Company launched the Allegiant World MasterCard issued by Bank of America. This is a co-branded credit card program providing cardholder benefits, which generates points based on dollar spend to be converted into dollars for items sold on the website such as flights, hotel rooms, car rentals and show tickets. The Company accounts for this new program using the relative selling price approach in accordance with ASU 2009-13 "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements." A portion of the revenue under the program is recognized monthly over the term of the arrangement as various marketing related services are performed by the Company. The remainder is deferred and recognized as points are redeemed for travel or other program benefits. 

Note 3   Investment Securities 
    
  The Company s investments in marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair market value with the unrealized gain or loss reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") in shareholders  equity. Excluded from the following table is the change in fair value attributable to the foreign currency risk being hedged. Refer to Note 7 - Derivative Instruments for additional information related to the Company's foreign currency hedge. Investment securities are classified as cash equivalents, short-term investments, and long-term investments based on maturity date. Cash equivalents have maturities of three months or less, short-term investments have maturities of greater than three months but equal to or less than one year, and long-term investments are those with a maturity date greater than one year.

Secured Debt - 2016 Transactions 
    
  In July 2016, the Company drew down   $50.4 million   under a senior secured revolving credit facility entered into during the second quarter 2016. The notes for the amounts borrowed under the facility bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus   1.85 percent   and are due on December 31, 2017. 
    
  Also in July 2016, the Company borrowed   $42.0 million   under a loan agreement secured by   three   Airbus A319 aircraft. The notes bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus   1.70 percent   and are payable in quarterly installments through July 2021. 
    
  In January 2016, the Company received   $28.0 million   of proceeds from notes executed in December 2015. The notes bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus   1.75 percent  , are payable in quarterly installments through January 2021, and are secured by   two   Airbus A319 aircraft.

Note 6   Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received by selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  
    
  Accounting standards pertaining to fair value measurements establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2, defined as inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
    
  The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to determine fair value for investment securities. The assets classified as Level 1 consist of money market funds for which original cost approximates fair value. The assets classified as Level 2 consist of commercial paper, municipal debt securities, federal agency debt securities, US Treasury Bonds, and corporate debt securities, which are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources including transactions involving identical or comparable assets and models utilizing market observable inputs. The Company has no investment securities classified as Level 3. 
    
  For those assets classified as Level 2 that are not in active markets, the Company obtains fair value from pricing sources using quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments, and uses pricing models which include all significant observable inputs: maturity dates, issue dates, settlement dates, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issue spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other market related data. These inputs are observable or can be derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset. 
    
  The fair value of the Company's derivative instrument is determined using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily available in public markets or can be derived from observable market transactions and therefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation models for derivative instruments include the applicable exchange and interest rates. 
    
  Financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands): 

10 

The fair value of the Company s publicly held long-term debt is determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets; therefore, the Company has categorized its publicly held debt as Level 2. The remaining debt agreements are not publicly held. The Company has determined the estimated fair value of these notes to be Level 3, as certain inputs used to determine the fair value of these agreements are unobservable and, therefore, could be sensitive to changes in inputs. The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of Level 3 debt. 
    
  Carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt, including current maturities and excluding related costs (in thousands): 

Due to the short-term nature, carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value. 

Note 7   Derivative Instruments 
    
  The Company entered into a foreign currency swap in order to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the forecasted lease revenue from   12   Airbus A320 series aircraft leased to a European carrier until 2018. The Company uses a cash flow hedge to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets, liabilities and forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the net change in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the unrealized loss on the hedge was   $0.5 million   compared to an unrealized gain of   $0.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  At inception, the Company formally designated and documented this financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective, and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. The Company also assessed whether the financial instrument used in the hedging transactions was effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. This assessment is monitored on at least a quarterly basis, and the change in fair market value of any ineffective portion of a financial instrument would be immediately recognized into earnings. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company realized   $0.8 million   in gains from its cash flow hedge into Other revenue, compared to   $1.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company expects   $0.6 million   to be reclassified from Other comprehensive income into Other revenue within the next 12 months. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Company's derivative instrument was   $1.5 million   compared to   $2.5 million   at December 31, 2015, and is reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheet within other assets. Refer to Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements for additional information related to the estimated fair value. 

Note 8   Shareholders  Equity 
    
  The Company is authorized by the Board of Directors to acquire its stock through open market purchases under its share repurchase program. As repurchase authority is used, the Board of Directors has, to date, authorized additional expenditures for share repurchases. 

11 

Share repurchases consisted of the following during the periods indicated: 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company declared and paid recurring cash dividends of   $0.70   per share, or   $11.5 million  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company declared and paid recurring cash dividends of   $1.70   per share, or   $28.2 million  . 

Note 9   Earnings per Share 
    
  Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, the Company attributes net income to two classes: common stock and unvested restricted stock. Unvested restricted stock awards granted to employees under the Company s Long-Term Incentive Plan are considered participating securities as they receive non-forfeitable rights to cash dividends at the same rate as common stock. 
    
  Diluted net income per share is calculated using the more dilutive of the two methods. Under both methods, the exercise of employee stock options is assumed using the treasury stock method. The assumption of vesting of restricted stock, however, differs: 
    
           1. 
    Assume vesting of restricted stock using the treasury stock method. 
       
           2. 
    Assume unvested restricted stock awards are not vested, and allocate earnings to common shares and unvested restricted stock awards using the two-class method. 
       
  For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the second method, which assumes unvested awards are not vested, was used in the computation because it was more dilutive than the first method. 

12 

The following table sets forth the computation of net income per share, on a basic and diluted basis, for the periods indicated (share count and dollar amounts in table are in thousands): 

For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , anti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation of earnings per share were   24,986   and   69,377  , respectively (shares not in thousands).  

Note 10   Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Company is subject to certain legal and administrative actions it considers routine to business activities. The Company believes the ultimate outcome of any pending legal or administrative matters will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had firm commitments to purchase the following aircraft: 

13 

Future minimum fixed payments for the Company's commitments related to the acquisition of aircraft, airport fees under use and lease agreements, and other operating lease obligations are as follows (in thousands):  

Note 11   Related Party Transactions 
    
  The Company previously entered into lease agreements for approximately   70,000   and   10,000   square feet of office space in buildings for which the Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and the Company's President owned minority interests as limited partners. For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2015  , the Company made rent payments of   $1.1 million   under the terms of these agreements. Beginning in 2016, payments for the   10,000   square feet of office space are no longer being made to a related party entity as the lender has taken ownership of the property. Additionally, the Company exercised its option to terminate the lease for   70,000   square feet of space effective in May 2015. The Company paid   $1.3 million   in January 2016 in settlement of litigation in connection with the termination of this lease. 
    
  Game Plane, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, partnered with Alpine Labs, LLC to produce and distribute game shows filmed on Company flights. The Company s Chairman and CEO owns a   25 percent   interest in, and is on the managing board of, Alpine Labs, LLC. For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2015  , the Company made payments of   $0.4 million   to Alpine Labs, LLC.   No   payments were made for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as no additional shows are being filmed. The Company does not expect any further expenses related to this project. 
    
  GMS Racing, LLC competes in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series and ARCA Racing Series. The Company's Chairman and CEO owns a controlling interest in GMS Racing, LLC. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company made sponsorship payments totaling   $2.3 million   to GMS Racing, LLC.   No   payments were made for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and no future payments are anticipated. 
    
  Entities owned or controlled by the Company's Chairman and CEO have been paid for the building of corporate training content, with a current focus on the Company's operating groups. This approach to training focuses on concept mastery, recognizing that individuals learn at varying paces, through different styles, and is designed to ensure the trainee fully understands each module before moving on to more advanced training. The Company also expects program development to facilitate recurrent training and to contribute to cost savings in the future, and is in the process of seeking approval from the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") on various aspects of this training program. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , the Company made payments to these entities of   $2.1 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively. The project is expected to conclude in 2017. 

Note 12   Fuel Tax Refunds 
    
  During the second quarter 2016, the Company recorded   $8.3 million   in fuel tax refunds which have been received as of October 2016. These refunds were reflected as a decrease to Aircraft fuel expense on the Company's consolidated statements of income for the second quarter 2016. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion and analysis presents factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Also discussed is our financial position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . You should read this discussion in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and our consolidated financial statements appearing in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking  
  
   14 

statements. Please refer to the section below entitled  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. 

THIRD QUARTER REVIEW 
    
  Financial highlights: 

$2.75   earnings per share (fully diluted),  
                
    operating 337 routes as of quarter end versus 271 at the same point in 2015, and 29 new routes currently scheduled to begin within the next two quarters, 
                
    payment of quarterly recurring cash dividends of   $11.5 million   during the quarter,   $28.2 million   year to date 
       
  Overview 
    
  In September 2016, we appointed John Redmond as President of the Company. Mr. Redmond served as an independent member of our board of directors since 2007 (excluding one year while attending to business obligations overseas) and will continue to serve as a member of the board. His prior experience as chief executive officer of MGM entities and extensive experience with other premier leisure organizations provides valuable travel industry knowledge.  
    
  Also in September, we launched the Allegiant World MasterCard issued by Bank of America. This is a co-branded credit card program that provides cardholder benefits and generates points based on dollar spend which can be converted into purchases for items sold on our website such as flights, hotel rooms, car rentals and show tickets. This program gives our customers more opportunities to travel, and we expect it will be accretive to earnings in the long-term. 
    
  In July 2016, we signed a purchase agreement to acquire 12 newly manufactured Airbus A320 series aircraft expected to enter service in 2017 and 2018. Although these aircraft will have higher purchase prices, we expect the benefits of a greater number of seats, better fuel efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and longer depreciable lives will make these aircraft efficient additions to our fleet. 
    
  The tentative agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ("IBT") for a collective bargaining agreement with our pilots was ratified in July 2016 and became effective on August 1, 2016. 
    
  Capacity grew by nearly 19 percent over third quarter 2015 as a result of market growth, in addition to opportunities for increased profitable off-peak flying due to lower fuel prices. Our average number of aircraft in service also increased (all Airbus aircraft) by   12.4 percent  , as we continue our move toward a single fleet type. Operating expense per available seat mile ("CASM") decreased quarter over quarter, largely attributable to the decrease in system average price per gallon of fuel as well as the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet. 

AIRCRAFT 
    
  The following table sets forth the aircraft in service and operated by us as of the dates indicated: 

(1) Excludes 12 A319 aircraft on lease to a European carrier until 2018. 
    
  We have solidified our plan for the full retirement of our MD-80 fleet in 2019 as we continue to transition to a single fleet type of Airbus A320 series aircraft. As of September 30, 2016, we have firm commitments to purchase 33 new and used Airbus A320 series aircraft which we expect to be delivered between 2016 and 2020. In addition, we expect to add to our operating  
  
   15 

fleet 12 owned Airbus A320 series aircraft currently on lease to a European carrier. We will continue to purchase used Airbus A320 series aircraft on an opportunistic basis. 
    
  Fleet Plan 
    
  The below table indicates the number of aircraft expected to be in service by the end of 2016 based on currently scheduled additions to, and retirements from, our operating fleet. 

NETWORK 
    
  The following illustrates our network as of the dates indicated (includes cities served seasonally): 

Our network as of the end of third quarter 2016 represents a 24.4 percent increase in the number of routes flown compared to the end of the same quarter in 2015. Mid-sized cities (included in number of under-served cities in chart above) served as of December 31, 2014, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 were zero, 17 and 19, respectively.  
    
  Including recent service announcements, we were selling 366 routes at September 30, 2016, including one new destination: San Juan, Puerto Rico (while discontinuing service to Palm Beach, Florida) and one new under-served city: Trenton, New Jersey. We also announced our move from Akron-Canton Airport to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport to better service the Cleveland, Ohio area. 

TRENDS 
    
  We are systematically retiring our MD-80 and Boeing 757-200 fleets as we transition to the Airbus A320 series aircraft as our single fleet type. Our ability to grow service and profitability during the period of fleet transition will be limited. Although this fleet transition will result in operating cost pressure in the short-term, we expect the long-term benefits of better fuel efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and longer depreciable lives of an all-Airbus fleet will more than offset the additional costs incurred in the transition. We plan to place two additional A320 series aircraft into service prior to the end of 2016, and retired one MD-80 and one Boeing 757-200 aircraft in third quarter 2016.  

16 

Although Airbus aircraft are significantly more fuel efficient than our other fleet types, in the long-term, fuel costs remain uncertain and volatility could materially affect our future operating costs. 
    
  The collective bargaining agreement with our pilots was ratified in July 2016, and provides for enhancements to pay scales, benefits, and work rules conducive to our unique operating schedule. Estimated incremental expense in the first year of the contract is expected to be approximately $44.5 million and an estimated increase in total cost of $290.0 million is expected over the five-year agreement term which became effective on August 1, 2016. 
    
  In August 2016, our flight attendants, represented by the Transport Workers Union, reached a tentative collective-bargaining agreement with us. The flight attendants chose not to approve this agreement and the parties will continue negotiations. Any labor agreement reached following negotiations would likely increase our operating costs. 
    
  In October 2016, our flight dispatchers voted in favor of representation by the IBT Local 986. We are in the initial stages of the process and a negotiating committee has yet to be formed. 
    
  In the current low-cost fuel environment, we expect competitive capacity trends will continue to put pressure on our yields in competitive markets. Based on published schedules by us and other carriers, we expect there will be mainline competition on 66 of the 360 routes we expect to be operating by the end of 2016. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Comparison of three months ended   September 30, 2016   to three months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Operating Revenue 
    
  Scheduled service revenue  .   Scheduled service revenue for the   third   quarter   2016   increased by 4.3 percent compared to   2015  . The increase was primarily driven by a   21.8 percent   increase in scheduled service passengers, offset by a   14.4 percent   decrease in scheduled service average base fare which was adversely affected by capacity growth into newer markets and increased off-peak flying to capitalize on the current low-cost fuel environment.  
    
  Ancillary air-related charges  .   Ancillary air-related charges for the   third   quarter   2016   increased 18.4 percent compared to   2015  , due mostly to the increase in scheduled service passengers resulting from capacity growth. These effects were diluted by a   2.9 percent   decrease in ancillary air-related charges per passenger as items such as bag fees tend to decrease in correlation with reduced stage length. 
    
  Ancillary third party products  .   The following table details the calculation of ancillary revenue from third party products. Third party products consist of revenue from the sale of hotel rooms, ground transportation (rental cars and hotel shuttle products), attraction and show tickets, and fees we receive from other merchants selling products through our website: 

(1) Includes payment expenses and travel agency commissions. 
    
  Ancillary third party revenue increased   13.8 percent   for the   third   quarter 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of our increase in scheduled service passengers, which was offset by a   6.5 percent   decrease in ancillary third party revenue per passenger largely attributable to a quarter over quarter decrease in hotel revenue margin. 

17 

Fixed fee contract revenue.   Fixed fee contract revenue for the   third   quarter   2016   increased   $4.5 million   from   2015   due mostly to the Apple Vacations charter which began in December 2015 as well as increased flying for the Department of Defense. The effects of this activity were slightly offset by the discontinuation of Peppermill Resorts charter service in January 2016. 
    
  Other revenue  .   Other revenue for the   third   quarter   2016   increased slightly compared with   2015  , due mostly to foreign currency exchange rates impacting aircraft lease revenue related to 12 Airbus A320 series aircraft.  
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  We primarily evaluate our expense management by comparing our costs per passenger and per ASM across different periods, which enables us to assess trends in each expense category. The following table presents operating expense per passenger for the indicated periods. The table also presents operating expense per passenger, excluding fuel, a statistic which gives management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility. Both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control. 

The following table presents unit costs on a per ASM basis, or CASM, for the indicated periods. As on a per-passenger basis, excluding fuel on a per ASM basis provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility. 

Aircraft fuel expense.   Aircraft fuel expense increased 1.5 percent for the   third   quarter   2016   compared to   2015  , as the system average fuel cost per gallon decreased by   13.7 percent  , offsetting the effect of a   17.8 percent   increase in system fuel gallons consumed (resulting from a   20.2 percent   increase in system capacity). 
    
  Additionally, ASMs per gallon increased over   third   quarter 2015 as Airbus aircraft flew 49.0 percent of scheduled service ASMs in the   third   quarter 2016, compared to 32.5 percent for the same period in 2015. We anticipate our fuel efficiency will continue to improve as we transition to an all Airbus fleet. 

18 

Salary and benefits expense.   Salary and benefits expense increased 24.5 percent for the   third   quarter   2016   when compared to the same period last year. The increase is primarily attributable to a   23.9 percent   increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees needed to support an increase in aircraft in service and the transition to a single fleet type. A quarter over quarter decline in our stock price led to a $3.1 million decrease in stock compensation expense.   
    
  The collective bargaining agreement for our pilots also went into effect on August 1, 2016, increasing salary and benefits expense for this work group by approximately $4.5 million over the same quarter 2015. Salary and benefits expense is expected to continue to increase at a higher rate than employee growth due to the increased costs associated with this agreement. 
    
  Station operations expense.   Station operations expense for the   third   quarter   2016   increased   21.9 percent   compared to the same period in   2015   due primarily to a   23.4 percent   increase in system departures. 
    
  Maintenance and repairs expense  .   Maintenance and repairs expense for the   third   quarter   2016   increased by   3.5 percent   compared to the same period in   2015   despite a   12.4 percent   increase in the average number of aircraft in service, due to fewer MD-80 aircraft major maintenance events quarter over quarter. Additionally, major maintenance events for the MD-80 aircraft are expected to continue to decline as we retire aircraft consistent with our fleet retirement plan.  
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense  .   Depreciation and amortization expense for the   third   quarter   2016   increased   6.3 percent   compared to   2015  , on a   12.4 percent   increase in the average number of aircraft in service. The effect of the increase in fleet size was diluted due to reduced depreciation on our MD-80 fleet as it nears full depreciation. However, we expect depreciation expense to increase in the fourth quarter 2016 and full-year 2017 as a result of our condensed MD-80 retirement schedule. 
    
  Sales and marketing expense.   Sales and marketing expense for the   third   quarter   2016   increased   $1.6 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . This is primarily due to increased advertising efforts for our expanding network, as well as expenses related to a national advertising campaign to support new market growth. The full effect of these increases was slightly offset by a decrease in credit card fee expense. We charge for credit card fee reimbursement, at zero margin, which is applied as a reduction to sales and marketing expense, and the net amount paid by us for credit card fees is reduced. Credit card fee reimbursements for the third quarter 2016 and 2015, were $6.2 million and $5.6 million respectively. 
    
  Other operating expense.   Other operating expense for the   third   quarter   2016   increased   $8.7 million   compared to   2015  . The increase is due to flight crew training needed to support our growing operating fleet, information technology expenses, increased property taxes, as well as additional crew costs due to irregular operations. 
    
  Income Tax Expense 
    
  Our effective tax rate decreased slightly quarter over quarter, at 36.0 percent for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to 37.1 percent for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The effective tax rate for 2016 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35.0 percent primarily due to state and foreign taxes, the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 related to share-based payments, as well as executive compensation deduction limitations. The effective tax rate for the same period in 2015 differed from the federal tax rate due to state and foreign taxes, the effect of which was reduced by a one-time tax benefit related to the liquidation of a subsidiary.  
    
  While we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term, it will vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income. Discrete items during interim periods may also affect our tax rates. 

Comparison of   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Operating Revenue 
    
  Scheduled service revenue  .   Scheduled service revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased 2.0 percent compared with 2015. The increase was mostly the result of an   18.3 percent   increase in scheduled service passengers offset by a   13.8 percent   decrease in scheduled service average base fare, which was affected by capacity growth into new markets and increased off-peak flying to capitalize on the current low-cost fuel environment.  
  Ancillary air-related charges  .   Ancillary air-related charges for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased 15.6 percent compared with 2015 due mostly to the increase in scheduled service passengers. These effects were diluted by a 2.3  
  
   19 

percent decrease in ancillary air-related charges per passenger as items such as bag fees tend to decrease in correlation with reduced stage length. 
    
  Ancillary third party products  .   The following table details the calculation of ancillary revenue from third party products. Third party products consist of revenue from the sale of hotel rooms, ground transportation (rental cars and hotel shuttle products), attraction and show tickets, and fees we receive from other merchants selling products through our website: 

(1) Includes payment expenses and travel agency commissions. 
    
  Ancillary third party products revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $2.8 million   over the same period in 2015. This was due to the increase in scheduled service passengers and offset by an   8.0 percent   decrease in ancillary third party products revenue per passenger, largely attributable to lower hotel room take rate.  
    
  Fixed fee contract revenue.   Fixed fee contract revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $10.7 million   compared with 2015, due to increased charter services for the Department of Defense and the commencement of charter service for Apple Vacations (contract began in December 2015), resulting in a combined $14.5 million of revenue during the first   nine   months of 2016. The effects of these agreements were partially offset by the discontinuation of Peppermill Resorts charter service in January 2016. 
    
  Operating Expenses  
       
  The following table presents operating expense per passenger for the indicated periods: 

*Includes effect of $8.3 million fuel tax refunds in the second quarter of 2016. 

20 

The following table presents unit costs, defined as Operating CASM, for the indicated periods:  

*Includes effect of $8.3 million fuel tax refunds in the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  Aircraft fuel expense.   Aircraft fuel expense decreased 15.7 percent for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. Excluding the effect of one-time $8.3 million in fuel tax refunds, fuel expense decreased 11.9 percent compared to 2015. The system average fuel cost per gallon declined by   24.2 percent   compared to 2015 (excluding the fuel tax refunds), which was offset by a   16.1 percent   increase in system fuel gallons consumed due to an increase in total system capacity of   19.0 percent  .  
  ASMs per gallon increased   2.6 percent   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 as Airbus aircraft flew 47.4 percent of scheduled service ASMs in the first nine months of 2016, compared to 30.2 percent for the same period in 2015. We anticipate our fuel efficiency will continue to improve as we transition to an all Airbus fleet.  
  Salary and benefits expense.   Salary and benefits expense increased 23.4 percent for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. The increase is mostly attributable to a   23.9 percent   increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees associated with an increase in average number of aircraft in service and the transition to a single fleet type. A year-over-year decline in our stock price led to a $6.4 million decrease in stock compensation expense.  
  The collective bargaining agreement for our pilots also went into effect on August 1, 2016, increasing salary and benefits expense for our pilots by approximately $4.5 million over the same period in 2015.  
  Station operations expense.   Station operations expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   28.8 percent   compared to the same period in 2015, which outpaced a   20.2 percent   increase in system departures. Station expense per departure increased 7.2 percent year over year partially because we are serving more medium-sized cities in 2016 compared to 2015, and these airports typically have higher ground handling fees than the smaller airports we serve. We have also experienced overall rate increases at numerous stations and increased inconvenienced traveler expenses due to irregular operations this summer.  
    
  Maintenance and repairs expense  .   Maintenance and repairs expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased    16.4 percent   compared with the same period in 2015, due to a   13.3 percent   increase in average number of aircraft in service over 2015.  
  Depreciation and amortization expense  . Depreciation and amortization expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   3.2 percent  , compared to the same period in 2015 despite a   13.3 percent   increase in average number of aircraft in service. The effect of the increase in fleet size was diluted due to reduced depreciation on our MD-80 fleet as it nears full depreciation.  However, we expect depreciation expense to increase in the fourth quarter 2016 and full-year 2017 as a result of our condensed MD-80 retirement schedule. 
  Sales and marketing expense.   Sales and marketing expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased minimally compared to the same period in 2015. We incurred increased expenses in the current year related to a national advertising campaign which launched in late September 2015, the effects of which were offset by the decrease in credit card fee expense. We charge for credit card fee reimbursement, at zero margin, which is applied as a reduction to sales and marketing expense, and the net amount paid by us for credit card fees is reduced. Credit card fee reimbursements for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 were $19.4 million and $16.1 million respectively. 
  
   21 

Other expense.   Other expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased 23.1 percent compared to 2015. This is primarily due to increased crew training in 2016 to support our fleet and network growth. We also had increased expenses related to irregular operations and various information technology initiatives.  
    
  Income Tax Expense 
    
  Our effective tax rate was   37.2 percent   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , up slightly from   36.7 percent   for the same period in 2015. The effective tax rate for 2016 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35.0 percent primarily due to state and foreign taxes, the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 as well as executive compensation deduction limitations. The effective tax rate for the same period in 2015 differed from the federal statutory rate due to state and foreign taxes, and was reduced by the effect of a one-time tax benefit related to the liquidation of a subsidiary. 
    
  While we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term, it will vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income. Discrete items during interim periods may also affect our tax rates.

  The following tables set forth our operating statistics for the periods indicated: 

* Except load factor and percent of sales through website during period, which are presented as a percentage point change. 
  ** Various components of this measure do not have a direct correlation to ASMs. This measure is provided on a per ASM basis so as to facilitate comparison with airlines reporting revenues on a per ASM basis. 
  *** Nine month statistics include effect of $8.3 million fuel tax refunds in the second quarter of 2016. 
  
   23 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Current liquidity 
    
  Cash, restricted cash and investment securities (short-term and long-term) decreased from   $407.8 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $397.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Restricted cash represents escrowed funds under fixed fee contracts and cash collateral against letters of credit required by hotel properties for guaranteed room availability, airports and certain other parties. Under our fixed fee flying contracts, we require our customers to prepay for flights to be provided by us. The prepayments are escrowed until the flight is completed and are recorded as restricted cash with a corresponding amount as air traffic liability. Investment securities represent highly liquid marketable securities which are available-for-sale. As of   September 30, 2016  , our unrestricted cash and investment securities balance (including short-term and long-term investments) was   $383.3 million  . 
    
  During the first nine months of   2016  , our primary source of funds was   $308.1 million   generated by operations as well as   $120.4 million   in proceeds from long-term debt issuance. Our operating cash flows and borrowings have allowed us to return value to shareholders and invest in the growth of our fleet. Our future capital needs are primarily for the acquisition of additional aircraft, including our existing Airbus A320 series aircraft commitments and pre-delivery deposits. We believe we have more than adequate liquidity resources through our operating cash flows, borrowings, and cash balances, to meet our future contractual obligations. We expect to finance a significant portion of the purchase price of our new Airbus aircraft order and believe the financing will be available on acceptable terms. In addition, we continue to consider raising funds through debt financing on an opportunistic basis. 
    
  In addition to our recurring quarterly cash dividend, we plan to continue repurchasing our stock in the open market subject to availability of cash resources and compliance with our debt covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , our authority under our board-approved stock repurchase program was   $92.3 million  . There is no expiration date for the program. 
    
  Debt 
    
  Our long-term debt obligations, without reduction for related costs, increased from $646.2 million as of   December 31, 2015   to $703.1 million as of   September 30, 2016   as we borrowed additional funds during 2016, while making scheduled repayments on our existing debt. During the third quarter 2016, we borrowed $42.0 million secured by three Airbus A320 series aircraft as well as $50.4 million against our senior secured revolving credit facility.   
    
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
    
  Operating Activities.   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our operating activities provided   $308.1 million   of cash compared to   $267.6 million   during the same period of   2015  . Operating cash inflows are primarily derived from providing air transportation and related ancillary products and services to customers, for which the vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day travel occurs. The year-over-year increase in reported cash inflows is primarily due to a   $14.7 million   increase in net income and changes in the amounts of certain current assets and liabilities.  
    
  Investing Activities.   Cash used in investing activities was   $284.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $153.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . The year-over-year increase is mainly due to   $113.8 million   paid in aircraft pre-delivery deposits during the third quarter 2016 and   $150.3 million   of other property and equipment purchases. No aircraft pre-delivery deposits were paid in 2015 and other property and equipment purchases totaled   $173.9 million  . Our net cash used to purchase investment securities (net of proceeds from maturities) was   $23.9 million   in 2016 compared to   $20.2 million   net cash received from proceeds of investment maturities (net of purchases) in 2015.  
    
  Financing Activities.   Cash used in financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $62.5 million   compared to   $125.6 million   for the same period in   2015  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased common stock for   $63.4 million   and paid cash dividends of   $55.9 million  , including the special dividend declared in 2015. We also had   $56.9 million   of cash inflows related to debt proceeds, net of principal debt payments. During the same period in   2015  , our primary use of cash was also the repurchase of common stock for   $121.1 million   and payment of cash dividends of   $57.4 million  . These uses were offset by   $46.6 million   of proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of principal payments.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
    
  A description of our critical accounting policies is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and as supplemented by disclosure in Part I - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  We are subject to certain market risks, including commodity prices (specifically aircraft fuel). The adverse effects of changes in these markets could pose potential losses as discussed below. The sensitivity analysis provided does not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor does it consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Actual results may differ. 
    
  Aircraft Fuel  . Our results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Aircraft fuel expense represented   25.3 percent   of our operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Increases in fuel prices, or a shortage of supply, could have a material impact on our operations and operating results. Based on our fuel consumption for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a hypothetical ten percent increase in the average price per gallon of fuel (excluding the effect of the fuel tax refunds for the nine months then ended) would have increased fuel expense by $7.0 million and $18.8 million, respectively.  
    
  Interest Rates  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a total of $366.4 million in variable-rate debt, including current maturities, and excluding related costs. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in market interest rates for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   would not have had a significant effect on interest expense, and would have increased interest expense by approximately $1.8 million for the   nine   months then ended.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a total of $336.7 million in fixed-rate debt, including current maturities, and without reduction for related costs, which had a fair value of $347.4 million. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in market interest rates as of   September 30, 2016   would not have impacted interest expense or have a material effect on the fair value of our fixed-rate debt instruments as of such date.  
    
  We have market risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short-term nature of our cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities, which totaled   $383.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Because of the short-term nature of these investments, the returns earned closely parallel short-term floating interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in market interest rates for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   would not have had a significant effect on interest income and would have increased interest income by approximately $2.4 million for the   nine   months then ended.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  (a)   Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.   As of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer ( CEO ) and chief financial officer ( CFO ), we evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the  Exchange Act ). Based on this evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed, and are effective, to give reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Based upon this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with or submitted to the SEC under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  (b)   Changes in internal controls.   There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ending   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  We are subject to certain legal and administrative actions we consider routine to our business activities. We believe the ultimate outcome of any pending legal or administrative matters will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
    
  We have evaluated our risk factors and determined the following changes to our risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A in the Form 10-K since we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K on February 22, 2016. 
    
  Increased labor costs could result from industry conditions and could be impacted by labor-related disruptions. 
    
  Labor costs constitute the largest percentage of our total operating costs. Industry demand for pilots and the supply of available pilots will impact our labor costs as we seek to retain our employees and compete against other airlines for qualified personnel. 
    
  Further, we have three employee groups (pilots, flight attendants and flight dispatchers) which have elected union representation. These groups represent approximately half of our employees. We recently reached a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters which was ratified by our pilots and became effective as of August 1, 2016. The agreement provides for enhancements to pay scales, benefits, and limited work rules. Estimated expenses over the five-year agreement term are expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations. 
    
  Although we reached a tentative agreement with the Transport Workers Union for the flight attendant group, that agreement was not ratified by the flight attendant work group. We are  also in the initial stages of the process with our flight dispatchers and a negotiating committee has not yet been formed. 
    
  Union contracts with our flight attendants and flight dispatchers could put pressure on our labor costs. 
    
  If we are unable to reach agreement on the terms of collective bargaining agreements in the future, or we experience wide-spread employee dissatisfaction, we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our operations and future results. 
    
  A  ny inability to obtain financing for aircraft under contract could harm our fleet retirement and growth plan. 
    
  We typically finance our aircraft through debt financing. Although we believe debt financing will be available for the aircraft we will acquire, we cannot assure you we will be able to secure such financing on terms attractive to us or at all. To the extent we cannot secure such financing on acceptable terms or at all, we may be required to modify our aircraft acquisition and retirement plans, incur higher than anticipated financing costs or use more of our cash balances for aircraft acquisitions than we currently expect. 

26 

Our plan to retire our older fleet types will limit our growth until replacement and additional aircraft are added to our operating fleet. 
    
  Our current fleet plan calls for the retirement of all of our MD-80 aircraft and B757-200 aircraft in 2019. The full retirement of our MD-80 fleet on this schedule will depend on our ability to close on the acquisition of Airbus aircraft now under contract and to source and acquire additional used Airbus aircraft which we have yet to identify or for which we have yet to negotiate contracts. The retirement of these aircraft will limit our network growth until such time as we have replaced these aircraft and added additional aircraft for service growth. If we are unable to close on Airbus aircraft now under contract or acquire additional Airbus aircraft not yet under contract by the end of 2019, our fleet replacement may be delayed and we may be limited in our ability to significantly grow revenues and profitability in the interim.

  CAPITAL STOCK 
  Section 2.1    Issuance and Notice  .  Certificates of each class of stock shall be numbered consecutively in the order in which they are issued.  They shall be signed by the President and Secretary and the seal of the corporation shall be affixed thereto.  In an appropriate place in the corporate records there shall be entered the name of the person owning the shares, the number of shares and the date of issue.  Certificates of stock exchanged or returned shall be canceled and placed in the corporate records.  Facsimile signatures may be utilized in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Article. Any shares of the Company s Common Stock and any other class of stock designated by resolution of the Board of Directors of the corporation may be recorded on the books of the corporation or its transfer agent as uncertificated shares; provided, however, that no shares represented by a certificate may be uncertificated until and unless such certificate is surrendered to the corporation or its transfer agent. Every holder of shares of stock in the corporation shall be entitled to have a stock certificate signed by, or in the name of, the corporation.  
    
  Section 2.2    Transfer Agents and Registrars  .  The Board of Directors of the corporation may appoint a transfer agent or agents and a registrar or registrars of transfer (other than the corporation itself or an employee thereof) for the issuance of shares of stock of the corporation and may require that all stock certificates bear the signature of such transfer agent and registrar.  In the event a share certificate is authenticated by both the transfer agent and registrar, any share certificate may be signed by the facsimile of the signature of either or both of the President and Secretary printed thereon.  If the same is countersigned by the transfer agent and registrar of the corporation, the certificates bearing the facsimile of the signatures of the President and Secretary shall be valid in all respects as if such person or persons were still in office even though such person or persons shall have died or otherwise ceased to be officers. 
  Section 2.3    Transfer  .  Upon the surrender to the corporation or to the transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of assignment of authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a certificate to the person entitled thereto, to cancel the surrendered certificate and to record the transaction upon its books. 
  Section 2.4    Lost Certificates  .  Any person claiming a certificate of stock to be lost or destroyed shall make an affidavit or affirmation of that fact and shall, if the Board of Directors so requires, comply with such other conditions applicable to the circumstances as the Board of Directors may require, including the delivery of a bond of indemnity, in form and with one or more sureties satisfactory to the Board of Directors, in at least double the value of the stock represented by said certificates; whereupon a new certificate may be issued of the same tenor and for the same number of shares as the one alleged to be lost or destroyed. 
  Section 2.5    Stockholders of Record  .  The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on the books as the owner of shares entitled to receive dividends or to vote as such owner and shall not be bound to  

recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided by law. 
  Section 2.6    Determining Stockholders of Record  .  The Board of Directors shall have the power to close the stock transfer books of the corporation for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days preceding the date of any meeting of Stockholders or the date for payment of any dividend.  Such date shall serve as the record date for the determination of the Stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or to receive payment of such dividend.  When a record date is so fixed, only Stockholders of record on that date shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting or to receive payment of any dividend, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date. 
  Section 2.7    Voting  .  The holders of the common stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock standing in their name.  The holders of any class or series of preferred stock shall have the rights to vote specified in the corporation's articles of incorporation or certificate of rights, preferences and privileges filed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada. 
  Section 2.8    Statement of Rights of Holders of Stock  .  So long as the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, there shall be set forth on the face or back of each certificate of stock, or the certificate shall have a statement that the corporation will furnish to any Stockholder upon request and without charge, a full or summary statement of the voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions and relative rights of the various classes of stock or series thereof. 
  ARTICLE THREE 
  STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS 
  Section 3.1    Place of Meetings  .  All meetings of the Stockholders shall be held at the registered office of the corporation or at such other place, either within or without the State of Nevada, as the Board of Directors may, from time to time, designate. 
  Section 3.2    Annual Meeting  .  An annual meeting of the Stockholders shall be held each year at such time and date between January 1 and June 30 as shall be designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.  If an annual meeting has not been called and held by June 30 of any year, such meeting may be called by the holders of ten percent (10%) or more of the voting power of the corporation outstanding and entitled to vote.  At such annual meeting, the Stockholders shall elect a Board of Directors as provided in Section 3.8 and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting. 
  Section 3.3    Special Meetings  . 
  A.      Calling of Special Meetings  .  Upon request in writing to the President or Secretary, sent by registered mail or delivered to such Officer in person, by any of the persons entitled to call a meeting of Stockholders, as provided in Section 3.3B below, such Officer shall forthwith cause notice to be given to the Stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting.  If the notice is not given within thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of the request, the persons calling the meeting may fix the time of meeting and give the notice in the manner provided in these By-laws. 
  B.      Persons Entitled to Call Special Meetings  .  Special meetings of the Stockholders, for any purpose whatsoever, may be called at any time by any of the following:  (1) a majority of the Board of Directors in office; or (2) the corporation s Chairman of the Board or Chief Executive Officer. 
  C.      Permissible Matters  .  Business transacted at all special meetings shall be confined to the objects stated in the notice calling the meeting. 
  Section 3.4    Notice  . 
  A.      Notice of Meetings  .  Notice of all meetings of Stockholders shall be given in writing to Stockholders entitled to vote signed by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or other person charged with that duty, or, in case of his neglect or refusal, or if there is no person charged with the duty of giving notice, by any Director or Stockholder. 
  B.      Method of Notice  .  A notice may be given by the corporation to any Stockholder, either personally or by mail or other means of written communication, charges prepaid, addressed to the Stockholder at his address appearing on the books of the corporation.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail  

with first class postage thereon, prepaid and addressed to the Stockholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the corporation. 
  C.      Time of Notice  .  Notice of meeting of Stockholders shall be sent to each Stockholder entitled thereto not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days before the meeting, except in the case of a meeting for the purpose of approving a merger or consolidation agreement in which case the notice must be given not less than twenty (20) days prior to the date of the meeting. 
  D.      Contents of Notice  .  Notice of any meeting of Stockholders shall specify the place, the day and the hour of the meeting and the purpose for calling the meeting. 
  Section 3.5    Waiver of Notice  .  Notice of a meeting need not be given to any Stockholder who signs a waiver of notice, in person or by proxy, either before or after the meeting; and a Stockholder's waiver shall be deemed the equivalent of giving proper notice.  Attendance of a Stockholder at a meeting, either in person or by proxy, shall by itself constitute a waiver of notice and a waiver of any and all objections to the time or place of the meeting or the manner in which it has been called or convened, unless a Stockholder attends a meeting solely for the purpose of stating, at the beginning of the meeting, any such objection or objections to the transaction of business.  Unless otherwise specified herein, neither the business transacted nor the purpose of the meeting need be specified in the waiver. 
  Section 3.6    Business at Stockholder Meetings  . 
  A.  At any meeting of the Stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting (i) pursuant to the corporation s notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (iii) by any Stockholder of the corporation who is a Stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice provided for in this Section 3.6, who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting, who meets the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and who complies with the notice procedures set for in this Section 3.6. 
  B.  For business to be properly brought before any meeting by a Stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) above of Section 3.6A, the Stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation.  To be timely, a Stockholder s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the date of the meeting.  A Stockholder s notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the Stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting:  (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation s books, of the Stockholder proposing such business, and the name and address of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (iii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such Stockholder of record and by the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, and (iv) any material interest of such Stockholder of record and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made in such business. 
  C.  Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at a meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.6.  The presiding officer of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this Section 3.6, and if such person should so determine, such person shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.6, a Stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 3.6. 
  Section 3.7    Presence by Telephone  .  Stockholders may participate in a meeting of the Stockholders by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by which all participants in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 
  Section 3.8    Quorum  .  The majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of Stockholders.  If a quorum is present, action on a matter (other than the election of Directors as provided below) by the Stockholders is approved if the votes cast by the Stockholders favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action unless provided otherwise (i) under the corporation's articles of incorporation, (ii) under the rights and preferences of any class or series of stock authorized, or (iii) under Nevada law.  When a quorum is once present to organize a meeting, the Stockholders present may continue to do business at the meeting until adjournment even though enough Stockholders withdraw to leave less than a quorum.  
  Each Director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to the Director s election at any meeting of Stockholders for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if, as of the tenth (10   th   ) day  

preceding the date the notice of the meeting is first sent to the Stockholders of the corporation, the number of nominees exceeds the number of Directors to be elected (a  Contested Election ), the Directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors.  The provisions of the foregoing sentence do not apply to vacancies filled by a vote of the Board of Directors under Section 4.3 of these By-laws.  For purposes of this Section 3.8, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted  for  a Director s election exceeds the number of votes cast  against  that Director s election (with  abstentions  and  broker non-votes  not counted as a vote cast either  for  or  against  that Director s election).  In order for a nominee who already serves as a Director to become a nominee of the Board of Directors for  service on the Board of Directors, the Director shall have tendered, prior to the mailing of the proxy statement for the annual or special meeting at which he or she is to be nominated for election as a Director, an irrevocable resignation that is contingent on (i) that person not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, and (ii) acceptance of that resignation by the Board of Directors in accordance with policies and procedures adopted by the Board of Directors for that purpose.  In the event a nominee who already serves as a Director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, the Nominating Committee (if there is one) or otherwise, such other committee designated by the Board of Directors, will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation or whether other action should be taken.  The Board of Directors will act on the committee s recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within ninety (90) days from the date of certification of the election results.  The committee in making its recommendation and the Board of Directors in making its decision may each consider any factors and other information that they consider appropriate and relevant.  Any Directors whose resignations are at issue shall not participate in the Board s decision with respect to whether to accept or reject his or her resignation.  If the Board of Directors accepts a Director s resignation pursuant to this Section 3.8, or if a nominee for Director is not elected and the nominee does not already serve as a Director, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy in accordance with the provisions of these By-laws or allow the vacancy to continue.   
  Section 3.9    Adjournment  .  Any meeting of the Stockholders may be adjourned by the holders of a majority of the voting shares represented at a meeting, whether or not a quorum is present.  Notice of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted at such meeting shall not be necessary, provided the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting with respect to who can vote at such meeting, then notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each Stockholder of record on the new record date who is entitled to vote at such meeting, which notice shall be given in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.4 hereof.  At an adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted which could have been transacted at the meeting originally called. 
  Section 3.10    Voting Rights  .  Each Stockholder shall be entitled at each Stockholders' meeting to one vote for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such Stockholder except as otherwise provided (i) under the corporation's articles of incorporation, or (ii) the corporation's certificate of rights, preferences and privileges filed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada, or (iii) as otherwise provided in Article VII of these By-laws.  Neither treasury shares nor shares held by a subsidiary of the corporation shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time. 
  Section 3.11    Proxies  .  A Stockholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy executed in writing by the Stockholder or by his attorney in fact.  If any Stockholder designates two or more persons to act as proxies, a majority of those present at the meeting, or if only one shall be present, then that one, shall have and may exercise all of the powers conferred by such Stockholder upon all of the persons so designated unless the Stockholder shall otherwise provide.  A proxy shall not be valid after six (6) months from the date of its execution unless it is coupled with an interest, or unless a longer period is expressly stated in such proxy, which may not exceed seven (7) years from the date of its creation.  Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the Stockholder executing it except as may be otherwise provided in the Nevada Revised Statutes. 
  Section 3.12    Election Judges  .  The Board of Directors, or if the Board shall not have made the appointment, the chairman presiding at any meeting of Stockholders, shall appoint two or more persons to act as election judges to receive, canvass, certify and report the votes cast by the Stockholders at such meeting; but no candidate for the office of Director shall be appointed as an election judge at any meeting for the election of Directors. 
  Section 3.13    Chairman of Meeting  .  The Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings of the Stockholders; and, in the absence of the Chairman of the Board, the President shall serve as chairman of the meeting. 
  Section 3.14    Secretary of Meeting  .  The Secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of the Stockholders; and, in his absence, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

13. 
    WARRANTIES AND SERVICE LIFE POLICY 
     This Clause covers the terms and conditions of the warranty and service life policy for the Aircraft. 
    
    For the purpose of this Agreement the term "  Warranted Part  " shall mean any Seller proprietary component, equipment, accessory or part, which is installed on an Aircraft at Delivery thereof and 
    
           (a) 
    which is manufactured to the detailed design of the Seller or a subcontractor of the Seller and  
              (b) 
    which bears a part number of the Seller at the time of such Delivery. 
     Subject to the conditions and limitations as hereinafter provided for and except as provided for in Clause 12.1.2, the Seller warrants to the Buyer that each Aircraft and each Warranted Part shall at Delivery to the Buyer be free from defects: 
           (i) 
    in material; 
              (ii) 
    in workmanship, including without limitation processes of manufacture; 
              (iii) 
    in design (including without limitation the selection of materials) having regard to the state of the art at the date of such design; and 
              (iv) 
    arising from failure to conform to the Specification, except to those portions of the Specification relating to performance or where it is expressly stated that they are estimates or approximations or design aims. 
       
   The warranties set forth in Clause 12.1.1 shall not apply to Buyer Furnished Equipment, nor to the Propulsion Systems, nor to any component, equipment, accessory or part installed on the Aircraft at Delivery that is not a Warranted Part except that: 
           (i) 
    any defect in the Seller's workmanship in respect of the installation of such items in the Aircraft, including any failure by the Seller to conform to the installation instructions of the manufacturers of such items, that invalidates any applicable warranty from such manufacturers, shall constitute a defect in workmanship for the  
     
   CT1107608            Page 31 
  CONFIDENTIAL 

purpose of this Clause 12.1 and be covered by the warranty set forth in Clause 12.1.1 (ii); and 
           (ii) 
    any defect inherent in the Seller's design of the installation, in consideration of the state of the art at the date of such design, which impairs the use of such items, shall constitute a defect in design for the purpose of this Clause 12.1 and be covered by the warranty set forth in Clause 12.1.1 (iii). 
       
   The warranties set forth in Clauses 12.1.1 and 12.1.2 shall be limited to those defects that become apparent within [ *** ] after Delivery of the affected Aircraft (the    Warranty Period   ). 
    
            13.1.4.1 
    The Buyer's remedy and the Seller's obligation and liability under Clauses 12.1.1 and 12.1.2 are limited to, at the Seller s expense and option, the repair, replacement or correction of any Warranted Part which is defective (or to the supply of modification kits rectifying the defect), together with a credit to the Buyer's account with the Seller of an amount equal to [ *** ]. 
     The Seller may alternatively furnish to the Buyer s account with the Seller a credit equal to the price at which the Buyer is entitled to purchase a replacement for the defective Warranted Part. 
    
           13.1.4.2 
    In the event of a defect covered by Clauses 12.1.1 (iii), 12.1.1 (iv) and 12.1.2 (ii) becoming apparent within the Warranty Period, the Seller shall also, if so requested by the Buyer in writing, correct such defect in any Aircraft which has not yet been delivered to the Buyer, provided, however,  
              (i) 
    that the Seller shall not be responsible, nor be deemed to be in default on account of any delay in Delivery of any Aircraft or otherwise in respect of the performance of this Agreement, due to the Seller's undertaking to make such correction and provided further  
              (ii) 
    that, rather than accept a delay in the Delivery of any such Aircraft, the Buyer and the Seller may agree to deliver such Aircraft with subsequent correction of the defect by the Buyer at the Seller's expense, or the Buyer may elect to accept Delivery and thereafter file a Warranty Claim as though the defect had become apparent immediately after Delivery of such Aircraft.

  CONFIDENTIAL 

In addition to the remedies set forth in Clauses 12.1.4.1 and 12.1.4.2, the Seller shall reimburse the direct labor costs incurred by the Buyer in performing inspections of the Aircraft to determine whether or not a defect exists in any Warranted Part within the Warranty Period subject to the following conditions: 
           (i) 
    such inspections are recommended by a Seller Service Bulletin to be performed within the Warranty Period; 
              (ii) 
    the reimbursement shall not apply for any inspections performed as an alternative to accomplishing corrective action as recommended by the Seller when such corrective action has been made available to the Buyer and such corrective action could have reasonably been accomplished by the Buyer at the time such inspections are performed or earlier, 
              (iii) 
    the labor rate for the reimbursement shall be [ *** ], and 
              (iv) 
    the manhours used to determine such reimbursement shall not exceed the Seller's [ *** ] estimate of the manhours required for such inspections. 
       
   The Buyer s remedy and the Seller s obligation and liability under this Clause 12.1 with respect to any warranty claim submitted by the Buyer (each a    Warranty Claim   ) are subject to the following conditions: 
           (i) 
    the defect having become apparent within the Warranty Period; 
              (ii) 
    the Buyer having filed a warranty claim within[ ***  
              (iii) 
    the Buyer having submitted to the Seller evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Seller that the claimed defect is due to a matter embraced within this Clause 12.1 and that such defect has not resulted from any act or omission of the Buyer, including but not limited to, any failure to operate and maintain the affected Aircraft or part thereof in accordance with the standards set forth in Clause 12.1.10 or from any act or omission of any third party; 
              (iv)

CT1107608            Page 33 
  CONFIDENTIAL 

The warranties set forth in Clause 12.1 shall be administered as hereinafter provided for: 
    
   Determination as to whether any claimed defect in any Warranted Part is a valid Warranty Claim shall be made by the Seller and shall be based upon the claim details, reports from the Seller's Representatives, historical data logs, inspections, tests, findings during repair, defect analysis and other relevant documents. 
    
   The cost of transporting a Warranted Part claimed to be defective to the facilities designated by the Seller and for the return therefrom of a repaired or replaced Warranted Part shall be borne by the Buyer. 
    
   If the Buyer and the Seller mutually agree, prior to such return, that it is necessary to return an Aircraft to the Seller for consideration of a Warranty Claim, [ *** ].  The Buyer shall make reasonable efforts to minimize the duration of the corresponding flights. 
    
   If the Seller determines that a defect subject to this Clause 12.1 justifies the dispatch by the Seller of a working team to repair or correct such defect through the embodiment of one or several Seller's Service Bulletins at the Buyer's facilities, or if the Seller accepts the return of an Aircraft to perform or have performed such repair or correction, then the labor costs for such on-Aircraft work shall be borne by the Seller. 
    
  The condition which has to be fulfilled for on-Aircraft work by the Seller is that, in the opinion of the Seller, the work necessitates the technical expertise of the Seller as manufacturer of the Aircraft. 
    
  If said condition is fulfilled and if the Seller is requested to perform the work, the Seller and the Buyer shall agree on a schedule and place for the work to be performed.

The Seller shall have the right to require the return of any Warranted Part, or any part removed therefrom, which is claimed to be defective if, in the judgment of the Seller, the nature of the claimed defect requires technical investigation. Such return shall be subject to the provisions of Clause 12.1.6.2. Furthermore, the Seller shall have the right to have a Seller Representative present during the disassembly, inspection and testing of any Warranted Part claimed to be defective, subject to such presence being practical and not unduly delaying the repair.

(a) 
    to determine direct labor costs, only manhours spent on removal from the Aircraft, disassembly, inspection, repair, reassembly, final inspection and test of the Warranted Part and reinstallation thereof on the Aircraft shall be counted. Any manhours required for maintenance work concurrently being carried out on the Aircraft or the Warranted Part shall not be included. 
              (b) 
    The manhours counted as set forth above shall be multiplied by an agreed labor rate of [ *** ], e.c. 2016 (   Inhouse Warranty Labour Rate   ), which is deemed to represent the Buyer s composite labor rate meaning the average hourly rate (excluding all fringe benefits, premium time allowances, social security charges, business taxes and the like) paid to the Buyer s employees whose jobs are directly related to the performance of the repair. 
     The Inhouse Warranty Labor Rate is subject to annual adjustment by multiplication by the ratio ECIn/ECIb. For the purposes of this Clause 12.1.7.5 only, ECIn shall be equal to the Labor Index, ECI336411W, defined in the Seller Price Revision Formula set forth in Exhibit C to the Agreement.  
    
           (c) 
    Direct material costs are determined by the prices at which the Buyer acquired such material, excluding any parts and materials used for overhaul and as may be furnished by the Seller at no charge. 
       
   The Buyer shall in no event be credited for repair costs (including labor and material) for any Warranted Part in excess of [ *** ] of the Seller s current catalogue price for a replacement of such defective Warranted Part. 
       
   The Buyer shall retain any defective Warranted Part beyond economic repair and any defective part removed from a Warranted Part during repair for a period of either [ *** ] after the date of completion of the repair or [ *** ] after submission of a claim for Inhouse Warranty credit relating thereto, whichever is longer. Such parts shall be returned to the Seller within [ *** ] of receipt of the Seller's request to that effect [ *** ]. 
    
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer may scrap any such defective parts, which are beyond economic repair and not required for technical evaluation locally, with the agreement of the Seller Representative(s).  
    
  Scrapped Warranted Parts shall be evidenced by a record of scrapped material certified by an authorized representative of the Buyer and shall be kept in the Buyer s file for a least the duration of the applicable Warranty Period.

       Supplier Part    means any component, equipment, accessory or part installed in an Aircraft at the time of Delivery thereof and for which there exists a Supplier Product Support Agreement. For the sake of clarity, Propulsion Systems and Buyer Furnished Equipment and other equipment selected by the Buyer to be supplied by suppliers with whom the Seller has no existing enforceable warranty agreements are not Supplier Parts. 
              13.3.1.3

If the Buyer experiences any technical problem in the operation of an Aircraft or its systems due to a malfunction, the cause of which, after due and reasonable investigation, is not readily identifiable by the Buyer but which the Buyer reasonably believes to be attributable to the design characteristics of one or more components of the Aircraft ("  Interface Problem  "), the Seller shall, if so requested by the Buyer, and without additional charge to the Buyer except for transportation of the Seller's or its designee s personnel to the Buyer's facilities, promptly conduct or have conducted an investigation and analysis of such problem to determine, if possible, the cause or causes of the problem and to recommend such corrective action as may be feasible. The Buyer shall furnish to the Seller all data and  
  
   CT1107608            Page 43 
  CONFIDENTIAL 

information in the Buyer's possession relevant to the Interface Problem and shall cooperate with the Seller in the conduct of the Seller's investigations and such tests as may be required. 
    
  At the conclusion of such investigation, the Seller shall promptly advise the Buyer in writing of the Seller's opinion as to the cause or causes of the Interface Problem and the Seller's recommendations as to corrective action. 
    
   If the Seller determines that the Interface Problem is primarily attributable to the design of a Warranted Part, the Seller shall, if so requested by the Buyer and pursuant to the terms and conditions of Clause 12.1, correct the design of such Warranted Part to the extent of the Seller's obligation as defined in Clause 12.1. 
    
   If the Seller determines that the Interface Problem is primarily attributable to the design of any Supplier Part, the Seller shall, if so requested by the Buyer, reasonably assist the Buyer in processing any warranty claim the Buyer may have against the Supplier. 
    
   If the Seller determines that the Interface Problem is attributable partially to the design of a Warranted Part and partially to the design of any Supplier Part, the Seller shall, if so requested by the Buyer, seek a solution to the Interface Problem through cooperative efforts of the Seller and any Supplier involved. 
    
  The Seller shall promptly advise the Buyer of such corrective action as may be proposed by the Seller and any such Supplier. Such proposal shall be consistent with any then existing obligations of the Seller hereunder and of any such Supplier towards the Buyer. Such corrective action shall constitute full satisfaction of any claim the Buyer may have against either the Seller or any such Supplier with respect to such Interface Problem.

LETTER AGREEMENT NO. 3 
  TO GTA No. 1-0000008363 

July 26, 2016 

WHEREAS,   CFM International, Inc  . (hereinafter individually referred to as  CFM ) and   Allegiant Air, LLC  (  herein, if referred to separately,    Allegiant ) and Sunrise Asset Management, LLC (  herein, if referred to separately,    SAM )   (together or separately (and notwithstanding that SAM is not an  airline ,   per se  ) hereinafter referred to as  Airline ) (CFM and Airline being hereinafter collectively referred to as the  Parties ) have entered into General Terms Agreement 1-0000008363 (hereinafter referred to as  GTA  and 
    
  WHEREAS, the GTA contains the applicable terms and conditions governing the sale by CFM and the purchase by Airline of spare engine(s), related equipment and spare parts therefor in support of Airline s CFM powered fleet of aircraft, including those acquired from Airbus S.A.S (   Airbus   ) (or  Airframer ). 
    
  NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows: 

1. 
    Allegiant has agreed to acquire and take delivery of (12) new firm CFM56-5B4 ( Engine ) powered A320CEO aircraft (together the  Aircraft ) direct from Airframer in accordance with the delivery dates set forth in Attachment A hereto, as the same may be modified, with notice to CFM, consistent with the terms of the Aircraft Sale Agreement (the  Aircraft Delivery Schedule ) pursuant to a sale  
     
   Allegiant 5B GTA No. 1-0000008363            CFM Proprietary Information                        Page 1 of 15 

and purchase agreement executed on or about the date hereof between Allegiant and Airframer (the  Aircraft Sale Agreement ).  The Engines installed in the Aircraft are hereinafter referred to as  Installed Engines . It is planned that SAM will make the purchase and lease the Aircraft to Allegiant. 
    
   Continued Production  means that at any relevant time, aircraft of the same make and model as the Aircraft and having the same make and model as the Engines remain in production (including aircraft manufactured but not delivered) by both Airframer and CFM.   
    
           2. 
    Provided that Airline takes delivery of at least [ *** ] of the Aircraft, Airline agrees to purchase and take delivery of [ *** ] CFM56-5B4 spare Engine ( Spare Engine ) from CFM according to the Spare Engine delivery schedule set forth in Attachment A hereto, as may be modified only by the mutual agreement of CFM and Airline (the  Spare Engine Delivery Schedule ).  If, at any time, Airline does not take delivery of at least [ *** ] of the Aircraft due solely to acts, or failure to act, of CFM, or due to reasons beyond the control of Airline, Airline shall have the right to terminate its obligations with respect to the purchase of the Spare Engine hereunder and any deposit or  Security  provided to CFM for the Spare Engine shall be promptly refunded to Airline, on demand and thereafter, neither party shall have any further rights or obligations with respect to the sale and purchase of the Spare Engine hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Airline acquires the Spare Engine prior to delivery of any Aircraft, this provision will be void and have no further force or effect. 
       
  3.   The reference price for Installed Engine shipsets ( Installed Engine Shipset Reference Price ), as and when delivered under the Aircraft Delivery Schedule, shall be [ *** ] (Jan. 2016 USD. CPI = 216.64) for CFM56-5B4 Engines. This Reference price will be the basis for the calculation of the Escalation Cap allowance described herein. 

In consideration of the above, CFM agrees to the following: 
    
  A.      Special Allowances 
       
  CFM agrees to provide the following allowances to Airline subject to the conditions set forth in Attachment B hereto: 
    
           (i) 
    Aircraft Allowance 
       
  For each of the Aircraft referenced and delivered to Airline under the Aircraft Delivery Schedule, CFM will provide Airline with a per-Aircraft allowance of [ *** ]. 

Allegiant 5B GTA No. 1-0000008363            CFM Proprietary Information                        Page 2 of 15 

Such per Aircraft Allowance is stated in January 2016 US Dollars (CPI=216.64), and shall be adjusted for escalation to the date of delivery of each Aircraft to Airline in accordance with the escalation formula set forth in Attachment D hereto.  If due to fault or negligence of Airline, there is a delay in delivery of Aircraft, such escalation shall stop at the original (scheduled delivery date in effect at the time of delay due to fault or negligence of Airline) scheduled delivery date of the Aircraft. 
    
  Each per Aircraft Allowance will be earned by Airline upon delivery of each shipset of Installed Engines to Airframer, and paid as follows:  
    
  If paid to Airline   
  Each per Aircraft Allowance will be made available and paid to Airline within (3) business days following receipt of written notice from Airline that it has taken delivery of each Aircraft.  
    
  If paid to Airframer   
  If requested in writing by Airline at least 30 days prior to scheduled Aircraft delivery date, CFM will pay the Aircraft Allowance directly to the Airframer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, CFM will not initiate the actual payment of the Aircraft Allowance to the Airframer until it receives further written direction by Airline at the time Airline takes delivery of each Aircraft.  
    
  Airline will keep CFM informed of any Aircraft delivery date changes. For the avoidance of doubt, CFM agrees it shall not provide the Aircraft Allowance to the Airframer without the Airline s further written direction under the foregoing and Airline agrees that it shall not issue such further written direction earlier than the date of Aircraft delivery to Airline. If, after such further written direction from Airline, CFM actually provides the Aircraft Allowance to the Airframer and the actual delivery date is delayed (not due to acts or failure to act by CFM) more than 2 days from the date CFM provides such allowance, Airline will pay to CFM interest on such amount, calculated from the date of payment to the Airframer to the date of actual Aircraft delivery. Interest will be computed at [ *** ]. Such payment to the Airframer may be offset against any amounts due and owing CFM. 
    
           (ii) 
    Spare Engine Allowance    
       
  Upon delivery of the Spare Engine, CFM will provide Airline with an allowance in the form of a [ *** ] credit off the invoice issued by CFM.  The price for the Spare Engine will be in accordance with Attachment C.      The Spare Engine Delivery Schedule may be mutually amended, but in no case will CFM provide a Spare Engine Allowance for Spare Engine deliveries which, due to fault or negligence of Airline, occur beyond [ *** ].

[ *** ] 
    
  [ *** ] 
    
  Notwithstanding previous agreements with Airframer, the Installed Engine Shipset Price so long as there is Continued Production, shall be subject to escalation from January 2016 (CPI=216.64) to the month delivery to the Airline, in accordance with Attachment D [ *** ]. 
    
  For Engines delivered directly to Airframer from CFM for installation on the firm Aircraft with delivery dates that occur after the period covered by the Aircraft Delivery Schedule, [ *** ].  

[ *** ] 
    
  The price of Spare Engines delivered directly to Airline from CFM with delivery dates that occur on or before December 31, 2018 shall be subject to escalation from January 2016 (CPI=216.64) to the month of delivery [ *** ].   
    
  For delivery of spare engines after December 31, 2018 and such delay results from the fault or negligence of Airline [ *** ]. 

B. 
    Spare Engine Base Price Protection    
       
  Base prices of the Spare Engine shall be as set forth in Attachment C hereto, and shall be subject to adjustment for escalation in accordance with Section 2 Part A.iv above, as applicable, through [ *** ].  If the delay of a Spare Engine delivery is not due to a fault of the Airline, the price will not escalate beyond the scheduled delivery date. 
    
  For [ *** ] Spare Engine in this Letter Agreement (and notwithstanding the provisions of Exhibit C of the GTA), CFM shall render to Customer an invoice for [ *** ] of the base price (unescalated) and constituting a progress payment of the price thereof, which Customer shall pay within [ *** ] calendar days after the date of the invoice; and payment of the balance, including amount for price escalation to the month of scheduled delivery, if any, shall be made upon delivery. 
    
           C. 
    Special Guarantees 
       
  CFM agrees to provide the following special guarantees to Airline in support of the firm Aircraft (Installed Engines) and Spare Engine described in this Letter Agreement.  These special guarantees are subject, to (i) the Limitation of Liability

  CFM ESCALATION FORMULA 

I.  
    The base price for Products purchased hereunder shall be adjusted pursuant to the provisions of this Exhibit. 
       
           II.  
    For the purpose of this adjustment: 
       
           A.  
    Base price shall be the price(s) set forth in the applicable Letter Agreement. 
       
           B.  
    The Composite Price Index (CPI) shall be calculated, to the second decimal place, using the following formula: 
       
  [ *** ] 

[ *** ] 
    [ *** ] 

[ *** ] 
    
           C.  
    Each CPI shall be determined to the second decimal place.  Calculation shall be to the third decimal digit and if the third decimal digit is five or more, the second decimal digit shall be raised to the next higher figure.  If the third decimal digit is less than five, the second decimal figure shall remain as calculated. 
       
           C.  
    The Base Composite Index (CPIb) shall be the base index stated in the published prices. 
       
           III.  
    Base prices shall be adjusted in accordance with the following formula: 
       
    [ *** ] 

IV.  
    The invoice price shall be the final price and will not be subject to further adjustments in the indices.  In no event shall the invoice price be lower than the base price.

IV.  
    The ratio   [ *** ]   shall be calculated to the fourth decimal digit.  If the fourth decimal digit is five or more, the third decimal digit shall be raised to the next higher figure, and if the fourth decimal digit is less than five, the third decimal figure shall remain as calculated.  If the calculation of this ratio results in a number less than 1.000, the ratio will be adjusted to 1.000.  The resulting three digit decimal shall be used to calculate Pn. 
       
           V.  
    Values to be utilized in the event of unavailability  .  If at the time of delivery of Product, CFM is unable to determine the adjusted price because the applicable values to be used to determine the   [ *** ]   have not been released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, then: 
       
  a)    The Price Adjustment, to be used at the time of delivery of the Product, will be determined by utilizing the escalation provisions set forth above.  The values released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and available 30 days prior to scheduled Product delivery month will be used to determine the   [ *** ]   values for the applicable months (including those noted as preliminary by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) to calculate the Product Price Adjustment.  If no value have been released for an applicable month, the provisions set forth in Paragraph b, below, will apply.  If prior to delivery of a Product, the U.S. Department of Labor changes the base year for determination of the   [ *** ]   values as defined above, such rebase values will be incorporated in the Price Adjustment calculation. 
    
  b)    If prior to delivery of a Product, U.S. Department of Labor substantially revises the methodology used for the determination of the values to be used to determine the   [ *** ]   values (in contrast to benchmark adjustments or other corrections of previously released values), or for any reason has not released values needed to determine the applicable Price Adjustment, CFM will, and without discrimination to Airline, and prior to delivery of any such Product, select a substitute for such values from data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics or other similar data reported by non-governmental United States organizations, such substitute to lead in application to the same adjustment result insofar as possible, as would have been achieved by continuing the use of the original values as they may have fluctuated during the applicable time period.  Appropriate revisions of the formula will be made as required to reflect any substitute values.  However, if within 24 months from delivery of the Product, the Bureau of Labor Statistics should resume releasing values for the months needed to determine the Product Price Adjustment, such values will be used to determine any increase or decrease in the Product Price Adjustment from that determined at the time of delivery of such Product. 
    
  c)    In the event escalation provisions are made non-enforceable or otherwise rendered null and void by any agency of the United States Government, the parties agree, to the extent they may lawfully do so, to equitably adjust the base price of any affected Product to reflect an allowance for increase or decrease in labor compensation and material costs occurring since February of the Base Price year (2016) which is consistent with the applicable provisions of this Price Escalation formula. 
    
  d)    For the calculation herein, the values released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and available to CFM at the end of the month prior to scheduled Product delivery month will be used to determine the   [ *** ]   values for the applicable months (including those noted as preliminary by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) to calculate the Product Price Adjustment for the Product invoice at the time of delivery.  The values will be

considered final and no Product Price Adjustment will be made after Product delivery for any subsequent changes in published index values. 
    
    Note  :      Any rounding of a number, with respect to escalation of the Product Price, will be accomplished as follows:  If the first digit of the portion to be dropped from the number is five or greater, the preceding digit will be raised to the next higher number  .

  BASIS AND CONDITIONS FOR SPECIAL GUARANTEES 

A.      General Conditions 
    
  The Special Guarantees offered in this Letter Agreement have been developed specifically for Airline's new Installed Engines and all Spare Engines, purchased under this Letter Agreement.  The General Conditions described in Exhibit A of the General Terms Agreement between CFM and Airline apply to the guarantees and such guarantees are offered to Airline contingent upon: 
    
  1.    Airline accepting delivery of the Installed Engines (with associated Aircraft) in accordance with the Aircraft Delivery Schedule and accepting delivery of the Spare Engine in accordance with the Spare Engine Delivery Schedule.  
    
  2.    Agreement between Airline and CFM regarding administration of the guarantees; 

B.      Administration 
    
  If compensation becomes available to Airline under more than one specific guarantee, Airframer guarantee for which CFM has agreed to participate in, warranty or other engine program consideration, Airline will not receive duplicate compensation but will receive the compensation most beneficial to Airline under a single guarantee, warranty or other program consideration.  If there is a dispute between CFM and the Airframer about which of them is responsible for payment of related compensation to Airline available under a Special Guarantee as a result of CFM s failure to meet such Special Guarantee, CFM shall promptly pay the compensation to Airline under such Special Guarantee and will be subrogated to Airline s rights to any related compensation from the Airframer (to the extent Customer may disclose information concerning the Airframer s obligations to compensate Customer). Unless otherwise stated, the guarantee compensation will be in the form of non-expiring credits to be used by Airline against the purchase from CFM of Spare Engines, spare Parts, and/or Engine services.

The compensation provided for Executive hereunder is inclusive of any fees received by Executive as an officer of the Company or any other company or corporate body in which Executive holds an office as a nominee or representative of the Company.  Any such amounts received by Executive shall be paid over to the Company. 
  M.  Clawback Agreement  .  In accordance with the Company s clawback policy, Executive hereby agrees to reimburse the Company for all or any portion of any bonuses or incentive or equity-based compensation if the Compensation Committee in good faith determines: (a) the payment or grant was based on the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a material financial restatement (other than as a result of a change in accounting principles) and a lower payment or award would have occurred based upon the restated financial results; or (b) the Executive engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct related to the Company or its business. In each such instance, the Company will, to the extent practicable and allowable under applicable law, require reimbursement of any bonus or incentive or equity based compensation awarded or effect the cancellation of any unvested or deferred stock awards previously granted to the Executive in the amount by which the Executive s bonus or incentive or equity based compensation for the relevant period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results, or such other amount as determined by the Compensation Committee, provided that the Company will not be entitled to recover bonuses or incentive or equity based compensation paid more than three years prior to the date the applicable restatement is disclosed. The Company agrees that the initial grants of Restricted Stock and SARs are not subject to clawback. 
    
  5.  Term  . The initial term of this Agreement shall commence as of September 12, 2016 (the  Effective Date ) and shall continue until September 11, 2019.  The term may be extended from year to year thereafter upon written agreement of the parties specifying the compensation arrangement for the extension period. 
    
  6.  Termination  : 
  A.  This Agreement shall be terminated upon Executive s death or upon a physician certified disability which permanently or indefinitely renders Executive unable to perform his usual duties on behalf of the Company.  In the event of a termination for death or disability, all outstanding stock options, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights held by Executive at the time shall become vested on a pro rata basis through the end of the last calendar month ending on or before the Termination Date (as hereinafter defined).  By way of example, if 10,000 shares of Restricted Stock are to vest on March 31, 2018 and the Termination Date is January 31, 2018 (four months after the last vesting date), then four-sixths or 6,667 of the shares of Restricted Stock to have vested on March 31, 2018, shall become vested on the January 31, 2018 Termination Date.

Executive may, without  Good Reason  (as defined in paragraph D below), terminate this Agreement by giving to the Company ninety (90) days prior written notice and such termination shall be effective on the date specified by Executive but in no event earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day following the date of such notice.  In such event, Executive shall continue to render his services up to the Termination Date if so requested by the Company.  In the event of such a resignation without Good Reason, all then unvested stock options, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights held by Executive shall be immediately forfeited.   
  C.  The Company may, without  Cause  (as defined in paragraph E below), terminate this Agreement at any time by giving to Executive written notice and such termination shall be effective on the date specified by the Company.  At the option of the Company, Executive shall immediately cease performing his duties hereunder upon receipt of the notice.    If terminated without Cause pursuant to this paragraph C, Executive shall be entitled to continue to participate in the Company s fringe benefits for six (6) months following Executive s termination and all outstanding stock options, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights held by Executive at the time shall become vested on a pro rata basis through the end of the last calendar month ending on or before the Termination Date.     
  D.  Executive may terminate this Agreement immediately for  Good Reason .  For purposes of this Agreement, Good Reason shall be defined as (i) failure of the Company to make any payment or provide any benefit to Executive  hereunder, which failure is not cured within thirty (30) days after the Company s receipt of written notice of such default, or (ii) a material diminution of Executive s duties and responsibilities or his title without Executive s consent; (iii) the imposition of a requirement on Executive  to report to a new CEO or to another officer unless approved by Executive , or (iv) the principal location at which Executive  is to perform his duties is relocated to a place more than fifty (50) miles from Las Vegas, Nevada.  Any termination under this paragraph D shall take effect immediately upon the Company s receipt of written notice from Executive after the expiration of any applicable cure period.  If Executive terminates this Agreement for  Good Reason  pursuant to this paragraph D, Executive shall be entitled to continue to participate in the Company s fringe benefits for six (6) months following Executive s termination and all outstanding stock options, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights held by Executive at the time shall become vested on a pro a pro rata basis through the end of the last calendar month ending on or before the Termination Date.   
  E.  The Company may terminate this Agreement immediately for  Cause .

the Company into disrepute; (iv) Executive  shall commit any act of fraud, dishonesty, theft or misappropriation, whether or not related to his activities on behalf of the Company, including providing false reports or accounts to the Company or deliberately making false statements about the Company, its services, employees, customers or suppliers; (v) intentional or repeated material neglect of Executive s duties; (vi) breach by Executive  of any other material provision of this Agreement; (vii) Executive shall become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise make an arrangement or composition with creditors generally; (viii) Executive shall engage in anti-social behavior (such as fighting, indecency, harassment, sexual or racial harassment or discrimination, intimidation of others, physical violence or assault) during the course of performing duties for the Company or against another employee outside of work; (ix) Executive shall have possession of illegal drugs at the Company s workplace; or (x) Executive  shall perform duties in a negligent or dangerous manner which causes or is likely to cause material loss or injury.  This Agreement may not be terminated by the Company under subclause (v), (vi) or (x) of this Item unless and until the Company has provided Executive with written notice of such violative conduct and Executive  has failed to cure (or fails to commence and thereafter diligently pursue the cure) such act within thirty (30) days after Executive s receipt of such written notice; provided, however, that no right to cure shall be available for a second or subsequent violation of the same provision within any twelve (12) month period.  Any termination under this paragraph E shall take effect immediately upon Executive s receipt of written notice from the Company or expiration of any applicable cure period, whichever is later.  The failure of the Company to terminate this Agreement for cause as a result of any of the foregoing at any one or more times shall not affect the Company s ability to terminate this Agreement for cause as a result of the subsequent occurrence of any act giving rise to  cause  hereunder, provided that Executive is still provided with a notice to cure if applicable in accordance with the above.  In the event of such a termination for Cause, all then unvested stock options, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights held by Executive shall be immediately forfeited.

  G.  Termination of Executive s Obligations  .  Executive s obligations under Items 7 and 8 of this Agreement shall survive the expiration of the term of this Agreement without renewal and termination of Executive s employment as provided in such Item. 
  H.  Resignation of Positions upon Termination  .  On the termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, Executive shall at the request of the Company immediately resign (without prejudice to any claims which Executive may have against the Company arising out of this Agreement or the termination thereof) from all and any offices which Executive  may hold as an officer or member of the Board of the Company and from all other appointments or offices which Executive  holds as a nominee or representative of the Company and if Executive  should fail to do so, the Company is hereby irrevocably authorized to appoint another person in Executive s name and on Executive s behalf to sign any documents or do anything necessary or requisite to effect such resignation(s) and/or transfers. 
  I.  Termination Date  .  For all purposes of this Agreement the  Termination Date  shall refer to the effective date of termination as set forth above.

  C.    The parties agree that: (i) the covenants and agreements of Executive  contained in this Item are reasonably necessary to protect the interests of the Company in whose favor said covenants and agreements are imposed in light of the nature of the Company s business and the professional involvement of Executive  in such business; (ii) the restrictions imposed by this Item are not greater than are necessary for the protection of the Company in light of the substantial harm that the Company will suffer should Executive  breach any of the provisions of said covenants or agreements; (iii) the covenants and  

agreements of Executive  contained in this Item have been independently negotiated between the parties and served as a material inducement for the Company to enter into this Agreement; and (iv) the period of restriction referred to in this Item are fair and reasonably required for the protection of the Company. 
  D.

  E.    The covenants and agreements on the part of Executive contained in this Item shall be construed as agreements independent of any other agreement between Executive and the Company.  The existence of any claim or cause of action of Executive against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of each of such covenants and agreements or otherwise affect the remedies to which the Company is entitled hereunder. 
  F.    If the provisions of this Item 7 should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time or other limitations permitted by applicable law in any jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be deemed reformed in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, or other limitation permitted by applicable law.

  (i)  directly or indirectly disclose, reveal, report, duplicate or transfer any Confidential Information to any other person or entity outside of the Company; 
  (ii)  directly or indirectly aid, encourage, direct or allow any other person or entity outside of the Company to gain possession of or access to Confidential Information;

Confidential Information may be written or oral, expressed in electronic media or otherwise disclosed, and may be tangible or intangible. Confidential Information also includes any information made available to the Company by its customers or other third parties and which the Company is obligated to keep confidential.

  B.  Executive  hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Company has expended considerable and substantial time, effort and capital resources to develop the Confidential Information, (ii) the Confidential Information is innovative and must receive confidential treatment to protect the Company's competitive position in the market and the Company's proprietary interest therein from irreparable damage, (iii) Executive, by virtue of his relationship with the Company, has had and will have access to the Confidential Information, and (iv) the Confidential Information and all physical embodiments or other repositories of the same shall be and at all times remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company.

Failure to require strict compliance with any term or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of a party s right to insist upon strict compliance with each and every provision of this Agreement.  No waiver of any terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of that or any other term of condition.

Any party which delivers a facsimile or pdf signature shall promptly thereafter deliver an originally executed signature to the other party; provided, however, that the failure to deliver an original signature page shall not affect the validity of any signature delivered by facsimile or pdf.

Each party has had the opportunity to be represented by counsel of its choice in negotiating this Agreement.

  The vesting of SARs will be accelerated to the extent provided in that certain Employment Agreement between the Company and the Participant dated September 9, 2016. 

B.      Partial Exercise  .  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the SARs (to the extent vested as provided in Paragraph 5A above) may be exercised in whole or in part. 
    
  C.      Method of Exercising SARs  .  Subject to Paragraph 5A above, any SARs granted hereunder or any portion thereof may be exercised by the Participant by delivering to the Company at its main office (attention of its Secretary) written notice which shall set forth the Participant's election to exercise a portion or all of the vested SARs, the number of SARs with respect to which the SARs rights are being exercised and such other representations and agreements as may be required by the Company to comply with applicable securities laws. 
    
  D.      Nonassignability of SARs  .  The SARs shall not be assignable or transferable by the Participant except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  Any distributee by will or by the laws of descent and distribution shall be bound by the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement.  During the life of the Participant, the SARs shall be exercisable only by the Participant.  Any attempt to assign, pledge, transfer, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the SARs, and any levy of execution, attachment or similar process on the SARs, shall be null and void. 
    
  E.      Termination of Employment other than as a Result of Death or Disability  .  If Participant ceases to be an Employee other than as a result of Participant s death or disability (as defined in Paragraph F below), then the SARs shall be exercisable only to the extent exercisable (  i.e.  , vested) on the date of termination of employment.  In such event, the vested SARs must be exercised on or before the date that is one hundred and eighty (180) days after the effective date of termination of employment.  To the extent any portion of the SARs is not exercisable (  i.e.  , not vested) on the date of termination of employment, such nonvested portion of the SARs shall terminate on the date of termination of employment.  To the extent any portion of the SARs is not exercised on or before the date that is one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of termination of employment, such portion of the SARs shall terminate as of the end of such date.  Nothing in the Agreement shall be construed as imposing any obligation on the Company to continue the employment of Participant or shall interfere or restrict in any way the rights of the Company to discharge Participant at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.   
    
  F.      Termination of Employment as a Result of Death or Disability  .  In the event of the death or disability of the Participant while in the employ of the Company, the personal representative of the Participant (in the event of Participant s death) or the Participant (in the event of Participant s disability) may, subject to the provisions hereof and before the earlier of the SARs' expiration date or the date that is one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of such death or disability, exercise the SARs granted to the Participant to the same extent the Participant might have exercised such SARs on the date of Participant s death or disability (  i.e.  , to the extent then vested), but not further or otherwise.  To the extent any portion of the SARs is not exercisable at the date of the death or disability of the Participant (  i.e.  , to the extent not then vested), such nonvested portion of the SARs shall terminate on the date of death or disability.  To the extent any portion of the SARs is not exercised within the time period provided, such portion of the SARs shall terminate as of the date of expiration of such time period.  For purposes of this Paragraph F, the Participant shall be considered to be subject to a disability when the Participant is disabled within the meaning of Code Section 22(e)(3), and the date of any such disability shall be deemed to be the day following the last day the Participant performed services for the Company. 
    
  G.      Period to Exercise SARs  .  The SARs granted hereunder may, prior to their expiration or termination, be exercised from time to time, in whole or in part, up to the total number of Shares with respect to which they shall have then become exercisable.  The SARs granted hereunder may become exercisable in installments as determined by the Committee; provided, however, that if the SARs is exercisable in more than one installment, and if the employment of the Participant is terminated, then the SARs (or such portion thereof as shall be exercisable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) shall be exercisable during the period set forth in Paragraph E or F (whichever is applicable). 
    
  H.      No Exercise after Five Years  .  The SARs shall in no event be exercisable after five (5) years from the date hereof. 
    
  I.      Payment of Cash Upon Exercise  .  Upon exercise of any portion or all of the SARs, the Company will make payment to Participant based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of exercise as provided in Item 2 above.  Deductions shall be made from any cash payment to Participant hereunder for social security, Medicare, federal and state withholding taxes, and any other such taxes as may from time to time be required by governmental authority. 

6.        No Rights as a Shareholder  .  The Participant shall not have any rights as a shareholder with respect to any SARs granted hereunder.  Except as provided in Item 4 of this Agreement or Section 12 of the Plan, no adjustment shall be made to the SARs granted hereunder as a result of any dividends or other rights paid with respect to the stock of the Company. 

7.        No Employment Rights  .  This Agreement shall not confer upon Participant any right with respect to the continuance of employment by the Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate such employment at any time. 
    
    8.        Enforcement  .  If any portion of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder shall be valid and enforceable to the extent possible.

Any written notice under this Agreement shall be deemed given on the date that is three business days after it is sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed either to the Participant at his address as indicated in the Company s employment records or to the Company at its principal office.  Any notice may be sent using any other means (including personal delivery, expedited courier, messenger service, telecopy, ordinary mail or electronic mail) but no such notice shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it is actually received by the intended recipient.  
    
  10.        Amendment  .  This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by the Company and Participant. 
    
  11.        Heirs and Successors  .  Subject to Item 2D above, this Agreement and all terms and conditions hereof shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns, and upon the Participant and his heirs, legatees and legal representatives. 
    
  12.        Interpretation  .  Any issues of interpretation of any provision of this Agreement shall be resolved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. 
    
  13.        Severability  .  The provisions of this Agreement, and of each separate section and subsection, are severable, and if any one or more provisions may be determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions, and any unenforceable provisions to the extent enforceable, shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable. 
    
  14.        Governing Law; Jurisdiction  .  All questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the internal law and not the law of conflicts of the State of Nevada. Each of the undersigned further agrees that any action or proceeding brought or initiated in respect of this Agreement may be brought or initiated in the United States District Court for the State of Nevada or in any District Court located in Clark County, Nevada, and each of the undersigned consents to the exercise of personal jurisdiction and the placement of venue in any of such courts, or in any jurisdiction allowed by law, in any such action or proceeding and further consents that service of process may be effected in any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 14.065 of the Nevada Revised Statutes or in such other manner as may be permitted by law.  Each of the undersigned further agrees that no such action shall be brought against any party hereunder except in one of the courts above named. 
    
  15.        Waiver  .  The failure of the Company to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of such provision or any other provision hereof. 
    
  16.        Deemed Signature; Counterparts  .    It is contemplated that the Participant will confirm his/her acceptance of the stock appreciation rights evidenced hereby and the terms of this Agreement by logging onto the Plan administrator s website and electronically indicating his/her acceptance. As the Participant s information on the Plan administrator s website is password protected, such acceptance shall be deemed to be the Participant s acceptance absent Participant s ability to establish that he did not accept this Agreement and that whoever indicated such acceptance did so without the Participant s knowledge or acquiescence. Further, the acceptance by Participant of any benefits from the stock appreciation rights granted under this Agreement (whether by exercising such stock appreciation rights or otherwise) shall also be deemed a confirmation by Participant of his intent to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.   If this Agreement is physically signed (which is not required), then it may be executed in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if all parties hereto had signed the same document, and all counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute one instrument.  If this Agreement is physically signed (which is not required), this Agreement may be executed by any party by delivery of a facsimile or pdf signature, which signature shall have the same force as an original signature.  Any party which delivers a facsimile or pdf signature shall promptly thereafter deliver an originally executed signature to the other parties; provided, however, that the failure to deliver an original signature page shall not affect the validity of any signature delivered by facsimile or pdf.  A facsimile, pdf or photocopied signature shall be deemed to be the functional equivalent of an original for all purposes. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed on the date first above written.

  AGREEMENT 

This Restricted Stock Agreement (the  Agreement ) is made as of September 9, 2016     ( Date of Grant ) between Allegiant Travel Company, a Nevada corporation (the  Company ) and John Redmond ( Grantee ). 
    
  1.  LONG- TERM INCENTIVE PLAN  .

A copy of the Plan is available to Grantee upon request and is incorporated in this Agreement by this reference.  Terms used in this Agreement that are defined in the Plan shall have the same meaning as in the Plan, unless the text of this Agreement clearly indicates otherwise. 
    
  2.  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS  .

  D.  This Agreement sets forth the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock granted to Grantee. 
    
  3.  RESTRICTIONS  .   
    
  A.  The Restricted Stock has been awarded to the Grantee subject to the transfer and forfeiture conditions set forth in Paragraph C below (the  Restrictions ) which shall lapse, if at all, as described in Section 4 below.  For purposes of this Award, the term Restricted Stock includes any additional shares of stock granted to the Grantee with respect to any Restricted Stock (e.g., shares issued upon a stock dividend or stock split) prior to the vesting of the Restricted Stock. 
    
  B.  Grantee may not directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, voluntarily or involuntarily, sell, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise transfer (a  transfer ) any of the Restricted Stock prior to vesting as provided in Section 4 below.  Any transfer or attempted transfer prior to such time shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever.   
    
  C.  Except to the extent provided in that certain Employment Agreement between the Company and Grantee dated September 9, 2016, if the Grantee s employment with the Company terminates prior to the vesting of all Restricted Stock of the Grantee for any reason other than as set forth in Section 4 below, then the Grantee shall forfeit all of the Grantee s right, title and interest in and to the Restricted Stock not vested as of the date of such termination and such Restricted Stock shall be reconveyed to the Company as of the date of such termination without further consideration or any act or action by the Grantee. 
     
  D.  The Restrictions imposed under this Section 3 shall apply to all shares of the Company s common stock or other securities issued with respect to Restricted Stock hereunder in connection with any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, stock dividend or other change in corporate structure affecting the common stock of the Company which occurs prior to the vesting of the Restricted Stock. 
    
  4.      EXPIRATION AND TERMINATION OF RESTRICTIONS  .  The Restrictions imposed under Section 3 above will expire and vesting of the Restricted Stock shall be as follows: 

A.  On March 9, 2017, the Restrictions will expire with respect to one-sixth (1/6) of the Restricted Stock of the Grantee not forfeited prior to that date; 
    
  B.  On September 9, 2017, the Restrictions will expire with respect to an additional one-sixth (1/6) of the Restricted Stock of the Grantee not forfeited prior to that date;  
    
  C.  On March 9, 2018, the Restrictions will expire with respect to an additional one-sixth (1/6) of the Restricted Stock of the Grantee not forfeited prior to that date; 
    
  D.  On September 9, 2018, the Restrictions will expire with respect to an additional one-sixth (1/6) of the Restricted Stock of the Grantee not forfeited prior to that date;  
    
  E.  On March 9, 2019, the Restrictions will expire with respect to additional one-sixth (1/6) of the Restricted Stock of the Grantee not forfeited prior to that date; and  
    
  F.  On September 9, 2019, the Restrictions will expire with respect to the balance of the Restricted Stock of the Grantee not forfeited prior to that date. 
    
  5.  ADJUSTMENTS  .  If the number of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company is changed as a result of a stock dividend, stock split or the like without additional consideration to the Company, the number of shares of Restricted Stock under this Agreement shall be adjusted to correspond to the change in the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock. 
    
  6.  VOTING AND DIVIDENDS  .  Subject to the restrictions contained in Section 3 hereof, the Grantee shall have all rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Grantee s Restricted Stock, including the right to vote the shares of the Grantee s Restricted Stock and the right to receive any cash or stock dividends, including dividends of stock of a company other than the Company.  Stock dividends issued with respect to the Grantee s Restricted Stock shall be treated as additional shares of the Grantee s Restricted Stock (even if they are shares of a company other than the Company) that are subject to the same restrictions and other terms and conditions that apply to the shares with respect to which such dividends are issued.  If a dividend is paid in other property, the Grantee will be credited with the amount of property which would have been received had the Grantee owned a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of Restricted Stock credited to his/her account.  The property so credited will be subject to the same restrictions and other terms and conditions applicable to the Restricted Stock under this Agreement and will be disbursed to the Grantee in kind simultaneously with the Restricted Stock to which such property relates. 
    
  7.  DELIVERY OF SHARES  .  The shares of Restricted Stock of the Grantee will be issued in the name of the Grantee as Restricted Stock and will be held by the Company prior to vesting in certificated or uncertificated form.  If a certificate for Restricted Stock is issued prior to vesting, such certificate shall be registered in the name of the Grantee and shall bear a legend in substantially the following form: 
    
   This certificate and the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to the terms and conditions (including forfeiture and restrictions against transfer) contained in a Restricted Stock Agreement dated September 9, 2016,     between the registered owner of the shares represented hereby and Allegiant Travel Company.  Release from such terms and conditions shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such Agreement, copies of which are on file in the office of Allegiant Travel Company.  
    
  Upon request from the Company, the Grantee shall deposit with the Company a stock power, or powers, executed in blank and sufficient to reconvey the Restricted Stock to the Company upon any forfeiture of the Restricted Stock (or a portion thereof), in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  Upon vesting of any Restricted Stock, any stock certificates and stock powers relating to such vested Restricted Stock shall be released to the Grantee upon request. 
    
  8.  WITHHOLDING TAXES  .  The Company is entitled to withhold an amount equal to the Company s required minimum statutory withholding taxes for the respective tax jurisdiction attributable to any share of common stock or property deliverable in connection with the Restricted Stock.  Grantee may satisfy any withholding obligation in whole or in part by electing to have the Company retain shares of the Restricted Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of vesting equal to the minimum amount to be withheld.  Fair Market Value for this purpose shall be the closing price for a share of the Company s common stock on the last trading day before the date of vesting. 

9.  OTHER RIGHTS  .  The grant of Restricted Stock does not confer upon Grantee any right to continue in the employ of the Company and does not interfere with the right of the Company to terminate Grantee s employment at any time. 
    
  10.  NOTICES  .  Any written notice under this Agreement shall be deemed given on the date that is three business days after it is sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed either to the Grantee at his/her address as indicated in the Company s employment records or to the Company at its principal office.  Any notice may be sent using any other means (including personal delivery, expedited courier, messenger service, telecopy, ordinary mail or electronic mail) but no such notice shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it is actually received by the intended recipient.   
    
  11.  NONTRANSFERABILITY  .  This Agreement and all rights hereunder are nontransferable and nonassignable by the Grantee, other than by the last will and testament of Grantee or the laws of descent and distribution, unless the Company consents thereto in writing.  Any transfer or attempted transfer except pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever. 
    
  12.  SECTION 83(b) ELECTION  .  Grantee may make an election to be taxed upon the grant of his/her Restricted Stock under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  To effect such election, the Grantee must file an appropriate election with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days after the grant of the Restricted Stock and otherwise in accordance with the applicable Treasury Regulations. 
    
  13.  AMENDMENT  .  This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by the Company and Grantee. 
    
  14.  HEIRS AND SUCCESSORS  .  This Agreement and all terms and conditions hereof shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns, and upon the Grantee and his/her heirs, legatees and legal representatives. 
    
  15.  INTERPRETATION  .  Any issues of interpretation of any provision of this Agreement shall be resolved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. 
    
  16.  SEVERABILITY  .  The provisions of this Agreement, and of each separate section and subsection, are severable, and if any one or more provisions may be determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions, and any unenforceable provisions to the extent enforceable, shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable. 
    
  17.  GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION  .  All questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the internal law and not the law of conflicts of the State of Nevada.  Each of the undersigned further agrees that any action or proceeding brought or initiated in respect of this Agreement may be brought or initiated in the United States District Court for the State of Nevada or in any District Court located in Clark County, Nevada, and each of the undersigned consents to the exercise of personal jurisdiction and the placement of venue in any of such courts, or in any jurisdiction allowed by law, in any such action or proceeding and further consents that service of process may be effected in any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 14.065 of the Nevada Revised Statutes or in such other manner as may be permitted by law.  Each of the undersigned further agrees that no such action shall be brought against any party hereunder except in one of the courts above named. 
    
  18.  WAIVER  .  The failure of the Company to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of such provision or any other provision hereof. 
    
  19.  DEEMED SIGNATURE; COUNTERPARTS  .    It is contemplated that the Grantee will confirm his/her acceptance of the restricted stock grant evidenced hereby and the terms of this Agreement by logging onto the Plan administrator s website and electronically indicating his/her acceptance. As the Grantee s information on the Plan administrator s website is password protected, such acceptance shall be deemed to be the Grantee s acceptance absent Grantee s ability to establish that he/she did not accept this Agreement and that whoever indicated such acceptance did so without the Grantee s knowledge or acquiescence. Further, the acceptance by Grantee of any benefits from the ownership of stock granted under this Agreement (whether by voting the Restricted Stock, accepting dividends on the Restricted Stock, selling any shares of Restricted Stock or otherwise) shall also be deemed a confirmation by Grantee of his/her intent to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.   If this  

Agreement is physically signed (which is not required), then it may be executed in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if all parties hereto had signed the same document, and all counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute one instrument.

  ALLEGIANT TRAVEL COMPANY 
  2016 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 

1.    PURPOSES OF THE PLAN:  The purposes of the Plan are to (a) promote the long-term success of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to increase stockholder value by providing Eligible Individuals with incentives to contribute to the long-term growth and profitability of the Company by offering them an opportunity to obtain a proprietary interest in the Company through the grant of equity-based awards and (b) assist the Company in attracting, retaining and motivating highly qualified individuals who are in a position to make significant contributions to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  "Award Document" means an agreement, certificate or other type or form of document or documentation approved by the Committee that sets forth the terms and conditions of an Award. An Award Document may be in written, electronic or other media, may be limited to a notation on the books and records of the Company and, unless the Committee requires otherwise, need not be signed by a representative of the Company or a Participant or alternatively, may be signed by electronic signature or other electronic indication of acceptance.  
    
  "Board" means the Board of Directors of the Company, as constituted from time to time.  
    
  "CEO" means the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

For purposes of clause (iii), the term "person" shall have the same meaning as when used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act but shall exclude: (A) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or of a Parent or Subsidiary and (B) a corporation owned directly or indirectly by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the common stock of the Company. A transaction shall not constitute a Change in Control if its sole purpose is to change the state of the Company's incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the persons who held the Company's securities immediately before such transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to an Award that is subject to Section 409A of the Code and for which payment or settlement of the Award will accelerate upon a Change in Control, no event set forth in an agreement applicable to a Participant or clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) will constitute a Change in Control for purposes of the Plan and any Award Document unless such event also constitutes a "Change in Ownership", "Change in Effective Control" or "Change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Company's assets" as defined under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder.

"Common Stock" means the common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share, or such other class of share or other securities as may be applicable under Section 12(b) of the Plan.  
    
  "Company" means Allegiant Travel Company, a Nevada corporation, or any successor to all or substantially all of its business that adopts the Plan.  
    
  "Effective Date" means the date on which the Plan is approved by the stockholders of the Company.

  "Exchange Act" means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.  
    
  "Fair Market Value" means the market value of a share of Common Stock on a particular date determined as follows. In the event the Company's Common Stock is listed on an established stock exchange, Fair Market Value shall be deemed to be the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on such stock exchange on such date or, if no sale of the Company's Common Stock shall have been made on any stock exchange on that day, the Fair Market Value shall be determined at such price for the next preceding day upon which a sale shall have occurred; provided, however, that for purposes of determining the amount of cash payable or stock issuable upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, Fair Market Value shall be the highest reported trading price on such day. In the event the Company's Common Stock is not listed upon an established system, but is quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board or similar trading market ( OTC ), the Fair Market Value shall be deemed to be the closing sale price (if reported) or otherwise, the mean between the closing dealer "bid" and "asked" prices for the Company's Common Stock as quoted on the OTC for such date, and if no closing sale price or "bid" and "asked" prices are quoted for that day, the Fair Market Value shall be determined by reference to such prices on the next preceding day on which such prices are quoted. In the event the Company's Common Stock is neither listed on an established stock exchange nor quoted on the OTC, the Fair Market Value on such date shall be determined by the Committee in its good faith discretion.  
    
  "Incentive Stock Option" means an Option that is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code or any successor provision thereto.  
    
   Misconduct  shall mean the commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement or dishonesty by the Participant, any unauthorized use or disclosure by such person of confidential information or trade secrets of the Company (or any Subsidiary), or any other intentional misconduct by such person adversely affecting the business or affairs of the Company (or any Subsidiary) in a material manner. The foregoing definition shall not in any way preclude or restrict the right of the Company (or any Subsidiary) to discharge or dismiss any Participant or other person in the service of the Company (or any Subsidiary) for any other acts or omissions, but such other acts or omissions shall not be deemed, for purposes of the Plan, to constitute Misconduct.

To the extent not prohibited by applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Committee may, from time to time, delegate some or all of its authority under the Plan to a subcommittee or subcommittees thereof or other persons or groups of persons it deems appropriate under such conditions or limitations as it may set at the time of such delegation or thereafter, except that the Committee may not: (i) delegate its authority pursuant to Section 15 to amend the Plan or (ii) delegate to any executive officer of the Company, or a committee that includes any such executive officer, the Committee s authority to grant Awards, or the Committee s authority otherwise concerning Awards, awarded to executive officers of the Company.

The Committee shall have the authority to select the persons to whom Awards may be granted and to determine the number and terms of Awards to be granted to each such Participant. Under the Plan, references to "employment" or "employed" include Participants who are directors or consultants of the Company or its Subsidiaries.  
    
  (b)      Grants to Participants  .

  5.    SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN: 
    
  (a)      Plan Limit  .  Subject to Section 12 of the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Shares that may be issued for all purposes under the Plan shall be 2,000,000 (the  Plan Limit ). Such number excludes any awards outstanding prior to the Effective Date under any prior incentive plan. Shares to be issued under the Plan may be authorized and unissued shares, issued shares that have been reacquired by the Company (in the open-market or in private transactions) and that are being held in treasury, or a combination thereof. Each Share issued pursuant to an Award other than an Option or a Stock Appreciation Right shall count as two (2) Shares for purposes of the Plan Limit. Each Share which may be issued upon exercise of an Option shall count as one Share. Each Share to which a Stock Appreciation Right relates shall be counted as one Share to the extent such Stock Appreciation Right is or may be settled in stock.  Any Stock Appreciation Right which may only be settled in cash shall not be counted against the Plan Limit. For Awards which are not denominated in Shares, the Plan Limit shall be reduced by the number of Shares delivered upon settlement or payment of the Award. 
    
  (b)   Share Replenishment  . In addition to the Shares authorized by Section 5(a), Shares underlying Awards that are granted under the Plan, but which are subsequently forfeited, cancelled or expire for any reason without being exercised or settled shall again become available for issuance under the Plan. In addition, to the extent a Stock Appreciation Right which may be settled in cash or stock is exercised for cash, the Shares underlying such Stock Appreciation Right shall again become available for issuance under the Plan. The following Shares shall not become available for issuance under the Plan: (x) Shares tendered in payment of an Option or other Award, and (y) Shares withheld for taxes or in payment of the Exercise Price of an Award. Shares purchased by the Company using Option proceeds shall not be added to the Plan Limit. Upon the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right  

for stock, the difference between the number of Stock Appreciation Rights exercised and the number of Shares delivered on the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right shall   not     be added back to the Plan Limit. 
    
  (c)       Special Limits  . Anything to the contrary in Section 5(a) above notwithstanding, but subject to Section 12(b) of the Plan, the maximum number of Shares that may be subject to Options and/or other Awards granted to any one Eligible Individual in any calendar year shall not exceed 100,000 Shares.  
    
  6.    AWARDS IN GENERAL: 
    
  (a)      Types of Awards  .  Awards under the Plan may consist of Options, Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Awards. Any Award described in Sections 7 through 10 of the Plan may be granted singly or in combination or tandem with any other Awards, as the Committee may determine. Awards under the Plan may be made in combination with, in replacement of, or as alternatives to awards or rights under any other compensation or benefit plan of the Company, including the plan of any acquired entity.  
    
  (b)      Terms Set Forth in Award Document  .  The terms and conditions of each Award shall be set forth in an Award Document in a form approved by the Committee for such Award, which shall contain terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to applicable laws, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate (i) the vesting or payment of any Time-Based Award, (ii) the lapse of restrictions on any Time-Based Award or (iii) the date on which any Time-Based Award first becomes exercisable subject, however, to the restrictions in Section 6(c). The terms of Awards may vary among Participants, and the Plan does not impose upon the Committee any requirement to make Awards or to accelerate Awards subject to uniform terms. Accordingly, the terms of individual Award Documents may vary. An Award Document shall not be a precondition to the granting of an Award; provided, however, that (i) the Committee may, but need not, require as a condition to any Award s effectiveness, that such Award Document be executed on behalf of the Company and/or by the Participant to whom the Award evidenced thereby shall have been granted and such executed Award Document to be delivered to the Company, and (ii) no person shall have any rights under any Award unless and until the Participant to whom such Award shall have been granted has complied with the applicable terms and conditions of the Award. 
    
  (c)      Minimum Vesting  . Except as otherwise provided herein, any Award shall have a minimum restriction period or performance period, as applicable, of one year from the date of grant; provided, however, that the Committee may provide for earlier vesting upon a Participant s termination of employment or service by reason of death or disability, or a Change in Control. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, up to five percent (5%) of the Plan Limit (the    Excepted Shares   ) shall not be subject to the minimum restriction period or performance period, as applicable, described in the preceding sentence, it being understood that the Committee may, in its discretion, and at the time an Award is granted, designate any Shares that are subject to such Award as Excepted Shares; provided, however, that, in no event shall the Committee designate any such Shares as Excepted Shares after the time such Award is granted. 
    
  (d)      Termination of Employment  .  The Committee shall specify at or after the time of grant of an Award the provisions governing the disposition of an Award in the event of a Participant's termination of employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations and subject to the limitation in Section 6(c), in connection with a Participant's termination of employment, the Committee shall have the discretion to accelerate the vesting, exercisability or settlement of, eliminate the restrictions and conditions applicable to, or extend the post-termination exercise period of an outstanding Award. Such provisions may be specified in the applicable Award Document or determined at a subsequent time. Should a Participant s service with the Company be terminated for Misconduct or should a Participant otherwise engage in Misconduct while holding one or more outstanding Awards under this Plan, then all Awards held by such a Participant shall, in the Committee s discretion, terminate immediately and cease to be outstanding. 
    
  (e)      Repricing  .     Except in the event of capital adjustments under Section 12(b) hereof, unless the approval of stockholders of the Company is obtained, (i) Options and Stock Appreciation Rights issued under the Plan shall not be amended to lower their exercise price, (ii) Options and Stock Appreciation Rights issued under the Plan will not be exchanged for (or cancelled and replaced with) other Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with lower exercise prices, (iii) Options and Stock Appreciation Rights issued under the Plan with an exercise price in excess of the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares will not be exchanged for cash or other property, and (iv) no other action shall be taken with respect to Options or Stock Appreciation Rights that would be treated as a repricing under the rules of the principal stock exchange or market system on which the Shares are listed. 
    
  (f)      Change in Control  .  The Committee shall have full authority to determine the effect, if any, of a Change in Control of the Company on the vesting, exercisability, settlement, payment or lapse of restrictions applicable to an Award, which effect may be specified in the applicable Award Document or subject to the limitations described below with respect to Performance  

Awards, determined at a subsequent time. Except as otherwise specified in an Award Document (or in a Participant's employment agreement), and subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Board or the Committee shall in its sole discretion, at any time prior to, coincident with or after the time of a Change in Control, take such actions as it may consider appropriate to maintain the rights of a Participant in an Award granted under the Plan, including, without limitation: (i) providing for the acceleration of any vesting conditions relating to the exercise or settlement of an Award or that an Award may be exercised or settled in full on or before a date fixed by the Board or the Committee; (ii) making such other adjustments to the Awards then outstanding as the Board or the Committee deems appropriate to reflect such Change in Control; or (iii) causing the Awards then outstanding to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefor, by the surviving corporation in such Change in Control; provided, however, that in the event of a Change in Control and unless the Award Document provides otherwise, the vesting of Performance Awards may not be accelerated except to the extent based on actual results through the date of the Change in Control or on a pro rata basis to reflect that portion of the applicable ongoing Performance Period that has elapsed as of the date of the Change in Control.  
    
  (g)      Dividends and Dividend Equivalents  .  The Committee may provide Participants with the right to receive dividends or payments equivalent to dividends or interest with respect to an outstanding Award, which payments can either be paid currently or deemed to have been reinvested in Shares, and can be made in Shares, cash or a combination thereof, as the Committee shall determine.  
    
  (h)      Rights of a Shareholder  .  A Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to Shares covered by an Award until the date the Participant or his nominee becomes the holder of record of such Shares. No adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to such date, except as provided in Section 12(b) of the Plan.  
    
  (i)      Performance-Based Awards  .  The Committee may determine whether any Award under the Plan is intended to be "performance-based compensation" as that term is used in Section 162(m) of the Code. Any such Awards designated to be "performance-based compensation" shall be conditioned on the achievement of one or more Performance Targets to the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code and will be subject to all other conditions and requirements of Section 162(m). The Performance Targets that may be used by the Committee for such Awards will be based on measurable and attainable financial goals for the Company, one or more of its operating divisions or Subsidiaries or any combination of the above such as net income, total revenues, operating cash flow, operating margin, operating revenue, revenue growth rates, pretax income, pretax operating income, growth rates, operating income growth, return on assets, total shareholder return, share price, return on equity, operating earnings, cost per available seat mile, cost per available seat mile excluding fuel, diluted earnings per share, earnings per share growth, or similar financial measures, or a combination thereof as selected by the Committee, and quantifiable nonfinancial goals. The applicable Performance Targets will be established by the Committee prior to the commencement of the applicable Performance Period (or such later date permitted by Section 162(m) of the Code). Each Participant is assigned a target number of Shares (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5(c)) payable if Performance Targets are achieved. Any payment of an Award granted with Performance Targets shall be conditioned on the written certification of the Committee in each case that the Performance Targets and any other material conditions were satisfied. If a Participant's performance exceeds such Participant's Performance Targets, Awards may be greater than the target number, but may not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of such Participant's target number. The Committee retains the right to reduce any Award if it believes that individual performance does not warrant the Award calculated by reference to the quantified results. In the event all members of the Committee are not "outside directors" as that term is defined in Section 162(m) of the Code, the grant and terms of Awards intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" will be made by a subcommittee appointed in accordance with Section 3(d) of the Plan consisting of two or more "outside directors" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code.  
    
  7.    TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS: 
    
  (a)      General  .  The Committee, in its discretion, may grant Options to eligible Participants and shall determine whether such Options shall be Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified Stock Options. Each Option shall be evidenced by an Award Document that shall expressly identify the Option as an Incentive Stock Option or Nonqualified Stock Option (or partially an Incentive Stock Option and partially a Nonqualified Stock Option), and be in such form and contain such provisions as the Committee shall from time to time deem appropriate.  
    
  (b)       Exercise Price  .  The exercise price of an Option shall be fixed by the Committee at the time of grant or shall be determined by a method specified by the Committee at the time of grant, but in no event shall the exercise price of an Option be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.  
    
  (c)       Term  .  An Option shall be effective for such term as shall be determined by the Committee and as set forth in the Award Document relating to such Option, and the Committee may extend the term of an Option after the time of grant; provided, however, that the term of an Option may in no event extend beyond the tenth anniversary of the date of grant of such Option.  

(d)      Payment of Exercise Price  .  Subject to the provisions of the applicable Award Document, the exercise price of an Option may be paid (i) in cash, (ii) by actual delivery for cancellation of freely transferable Shares already owned by the person exercising the Option, (iii) by a combination of cash and Shares equal in value to the exercise price, (iv) through net share settlement or similar procedure involving the withholding of Shares subject to the Option with a value equal to the exercise price or (v) by such other means as the Committee, in its discretion, may authorize. In accordance with the rules and procedures authorized by the Committee for this purpose, the Option may also be exercised through a "cashless exercise" procedure authorized by the Committee that permits Participants to exercise Options by delivering a properly executed exercise notice to the Company together with a copy of irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds necessary to pay the exercise price and the amount of any required tax or other withholding obligations.  
    
  (e)      Incentive Stock Options  .  The exercise price per Share of an Incentive Stock Option shall be fixed by the Committee at the time of grant or shall be determined by a method specified by the Committee at the time of grant. No Incentive Stock Option may be issued pursuant to the Plan to any individual who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless (i) the exercise price determined as of the date of grant is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant of the Shares subject to such Incentive Stock Option and (ii) the Incentive Stock Option is not exercisable more than five years from the date of grant thereof. No Participant shall be granted any Incentive Stock Option which would result in such Participant receiving a grant of Incentive Stock Options that would have an aggregate Fair Market Value in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), determined as of the time of grant, that would be exercisable for the first time by such Participant during any calendar year. The terms of any Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, and any regulations promulgated thereunder.  
    
           8. 
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND RESTRICTED STOCK: 
       
  (a)      Restricted Stock Units  .  The Committee is authorized to grant Restricted Stock Units to Eligible Individuals. A Restricted Stock Unit shall entitle a Participant to receive, subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in the Plan and the applicable Award Document, one or more Shares in consideration of the Participant's employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Restricted Stock Units shall be paid in Shares, cash, or a combination of cash and Shares as provided in the Award Document, with a value equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares at the time of payment.  
    
  (b)      Restricted Stock  .  An Award of Restricted Stock shall consist of one or more shares of Common Stock granted or sold to an Eligible Individual, and shall be subject to the terms and conditions established by the Committee in connection with the Award and specified in the applicable Award Document. Restricted Stock may, among other things, be subject to restrictions on transferability, vesting requirements or other specified circumstances under which it may be canceled.  
    
  9.    STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS: 
    
  (a)      General  .  The Committee is authorized to grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Eligible Individuals. A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle a Participant to receive, upon satisfaction of the conditions to payment specified in the applicable Award Document, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of the number of Shares for which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised over the grant price for such Stock Appreciation Right specified in the applicable Award Document. The grant price per share of Shares covered by a Stock Appreciation Right shall be fixed by the Committee at the time of grant or, alternatively, shall be determined by a method specified by the Committee at the time of grant, but in no event shall the grant price of a Stock Appreciation Right be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. At the sole discretion of the Committee, the Award Document may provide that payments to a Participant upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right may be made in cash or Shares, or in a combination of cash and Shares, having an aggregate Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise equal to such cash amount.  
    
  (b)       Term  .  A Stock Appreciation Right shall be effective for such term as shall be determined by the Committee and as set forth in the Award Document relating to such Stock Appreciation Right, and the Committee may extend the term of a Stock Appreciation Right after the time of grant; provided, however, that the term of a Stock Appreciation Right may in no event extend beyond the tenth anniversary of the date of grant of such Stock Appreciation Right.  
    
  (c)      Methods of Exercise  .  In accordance with the rules and procedures established by the Committee for this purpose, and subject to the provisions of the applicable Award Document and all applicable laws, the Committee shall determine the permissible methods of exercise for a Stock Appreciation Right.  

(d)      Stock Appreciation Rights in Tandem with Options  .  A Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option may be granted either at the same time as such Option or subsequent thereto. If granted in tandem with an Option, a Stock Appreciation Right shall cover the same number of Shares as covered by the Option (or such lesser number of shares as the Committee may determine) and shall be exercisable only at such time or times and to the extent the related Option shall be exercisable, and shall have the same term as the related Option. The grant price of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option shall equal the per share exercise price of the Option to which it relates. Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option, the related Option shall be canceled automatically to the extent of the number of Shares covered by such exercise; conversely, if the related Option is exercised as to some or all of the Shares covered by the tandem grant, the tandem Stock Appreciation Right shall be canceled automatically to the extent of the number of Shares covered by the Option exercise.  
    
  10.    OTHER AWARDS:  The Committee shall have the authority to specify the terms and provisions of other forms of equity-based or equity-related Awards not described above that the Committee determines to be consistent with the purpose of the Plan and the interests of the Company, which Awards may provide for cash payments based in whole or in part on the value or future value of Shares, for the acquisition or future acquisition of Shares, or any combination thereof.  
    
  11.    CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS: 
    
  (a)      Transfers  . Unless the Committee determines otherwise on or after the date of grant, no Award shall be transferable other than by last will and testament or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Committee may, in its discretion and subject to such terms and conditions as it shall specify, permit the transfer of an Award for no consideration (i) to a Participant's family member, (ii) to one or more trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such family members, (iii) to one or more entities which are beneficially owned in whole or in part by one or more such family members or (iv) to any other individual or entity permitted under law and the rules of the stock exchange that lists the Shares (collectively, "Permitted Transferees"). Any Award transferred to a Permitted Transferee shall be further transferable only by last will and testament or the laws of descent and distribution or, for no consideration, to another Permitted Transferee of the Participant.  
    
  (b)      Award Exercisable Only by Participant  .  During the lifetime of a Participant, an Award shall be exercisable only by the Participant or by a Permitted Transferee to whom such Award has been transferred in accordance with Section 11(a) above. The grant of an Award shall impose no obligation on a Participant to exercise or settle the Award.  
    
  12.    RECAPITALIZATION OR REORGANIZATION: 
    
  (a)      Authority of the Company and Stockholders  .  The existence of the Plan, the Award Documents and the Awards granted hereunder shall not affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Company or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company's capital structure or business, any merger or consolidation of the Company, any issue of stock or of options, warrants or rights to purchase stock or of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks whose rights are superior to or affect the Shares or the rights thereof or which are convertible into or exchangeable for Shares, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.  
    
  (b)      Change in Capitalization  .  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or any Award Document, the number (the Plan Limit) and kind of Shares authorized for issuance under Section 5 of the Plan, including the maximum number of Shares available under the special limits provided for in Section 5(c), shall be equitably adjusted in the event of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation and may be equitably adjusted in the sole discretion of the Committee in the event of an extraordinary dividend, split-up, spin-off, combination, exchange of Shares, warrants or rights offering to purchase Shares at a price substantially below Fair Market Value or other similar corporate event affecting the Shares.  In each case in which an adjustment is made, the adjustment shall be to preserve, but not increase, the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan. In addition, upon the occurrence of any of the foregoing events for which an adjustment is made, the number of outstanding Awards and the number and kind of Shares subject to any outstanding Award and the exercise price per Share (or the grant price per Share, as the case may be), if any, under any outstanding Award shall be equitably adjusted (including by payment of cash to a Participant) in the sole discretion of the Committee in order to preserve the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available to Participants granted Awards. Such adjustments shall be made by the Committee, in its sole discretion, whose determination as to what adjustments shall be made, and the extent thereof, shall be final. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, such adjusted Awards shall be subject to the same restrictions and vesting or settlement schedule to which the underlying Award is subject.  

13.    TERM OF THE PLAN:  Unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 15 of the Plan, the Plan shall terminate on June 30, 2026, except with respect to Awards then outstanding. No Awards may be granted under the Plan after June 30, 2026.  
    
  14.    EFFECTIVE DATE:  The Plan shall become effective on the Effective Date; provided, however, that if the Plan is not approved by the stockholders upon submission to them for approval, the Plan shall be void   ab initio  .  
    
  15.    AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION:  Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Board may at any time terminate or, from time to time, amend, modify or suspend the Plan; provided, however, that no termination, amendment, modification or suspension of the Plan shall materially and adversely alter or impair the rights of a Participant in any Award previously made under the Plan without the consent of the holder thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall have broad authority to amend the Plan or any Award under the Plan without the consent of a Participant to the extent it deems necessary or desirable (a) to comply with, or take into account changes in, applicable tax laws, securities laws, accounting rules and other applicable laws, rules and regulations or (b) to ensure that an Award is not subject to interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code. In addition, no such amendment shall be made without the approval of the Company s stockholders to the extent such approval is required by any applicable law, tax rules, stock exchange rules or accounting rules (including as necessary to comply with any rules or requirements of any securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which the Shares may be listed or quoted or to prevent the Company from being denied a tax deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code). 
    
  16.    MISCELLANEOUS: 
    
  (a)      Tax Withholding  .  The Company or a Subsidiary, as appropriate, may require any individual entitled to receive a payment in respect of an Award or to vest in a Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit grant to remit to the Company, prior to such payment or in connection with such vesting, an amount sufficient to satisfy any applicable tax withholding requirements. In the case of an Award payable in Shares, the Company or a Subsidiary, as appropriate, may permit such individual to satisfy, in whole or in part, such obligation to remit taxes by directing the Company to withhold Shares that would otherwise be received by such individual or to repurchase Shares that were issued to such individual to satisfy the statutory withholding rates for any applicable tax withholding purposes, in accordance with all applicable laws and pursuant to such rules as the Committee may establish from time to time. The Company or a Subsidiary, as appropriate, shall also have the right to deduct from all cash payments made to a Participant (whether or not such payment is made in connection with an Award) any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payments.  
    
  (b)      No Right to Awards or Employment  .  No person shall have any claim or right to receive Awards under the Plan. Neither the Plan, the grant of Awards under the Plan nor any action taken or omitted to be taken under the Plan shall be deemed to create or confer on any Eligible Individual any right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary or other affiliate thereof, or to interfere with or to limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary or other affiliate thereof to terminate the employment of such Eligible Individual at any time. No Award shall constitute salary, recurrent compensation or contractual compensation for the year of grant, any later year or any other period of time. Payments received by a Participant under any Award made pursuant to the Plan shall not be included in, nor have any effect on, the determination of employment-related rights or benefits under any other employee benefit plan or similar arrangement provided by the Company and the Subsidiaries, unless otherwise specifically provided for under the terms of such plan or arrangement or by the Committee. 
    
  (c)      Forfeiture; Recoupment  . Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan or any Award Document to the contrary, Awards will be subject, to the extent applicable, to: (a) the terms and conditions of the Company s executive compensation recoupment policy (as previously adopted, and as may be amended and restated from time to time); and (b) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended (the    Dodd Frank Act   ), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and rules, regulations and binding, published guidance thereunder, and any similar legislation that may be enacted subsequent to the date hereof (including any rules, regulations and binding, published guidance thereunder). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole discretion, implement any recoupment policies or make any changes to the Company s existing recoupment policies as the Company deems necessary or advisable in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory guidance (including, without limitation, the Dodd-Frank Act).  
    
  (d)      Securities Law Restrictions  .  An Award may not be exercised or settled and no Shares may be issued in connection with an Award unless the issuance of such shares has been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and qualified under applicable state "blue sky" laws and any applicable foreign securities laws, or the Company has determined that an exemption from registration and from qualification under such state "blue sky" laws is available. The Committee may require each Participant purchasing or acquiring Shares pursuant to an Award under the Plan to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that such Eligible Individual is acquiring the Shares for investment purposes and not with a view to the distribution thereof. All certificates for Shares delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any exchange  

upon which the Shares are then listed, and any applicable securities law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.  
    
  (e)      Section 162(m) of the Code  .  The Plan is intended to comply in all respects with Section 162(m) of the Code.  
    
  (f)      Awards to Individuals Subject to Laws of a Jurisdiction Outside of the United States  .  To the extent that Awards under the Plan are awarded to individuals who are domiciled or resident outside of the United States or to persons who are domiciled or resident in the United States but who are subject to the tax laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States, the Committee may adjust the terms of the Awards granted hereunder to such person (i) to comply with the laws of such jurisdiction and (ii) to permit the grant of the Award not to be a taxable event to the Participant. The authority granted under the previous sentence shall include the discretion for the Committee to adopt, on behalf of the Company, one or more sub-plans applicable to separate classes of Eligible Individuals who are subject to the laws of jurisdictions outside of the United States.  
    
  (g)      Satisfaction of Obligations  . Subject to applicable law, the Company may apply any cash, Shares, securities or other consideration received upon exercise or settlement of an Award to any obligations a Participant owes to the Company and the Subsidiaries in connection with the Plan or otherwise, including, without limitation, any tax obligations or obligations under a currency facility established in connection with the Plan.  
    
  (h)      Unfunded Plan  .  The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded plan for incentive compensation. Prior to the issuance of Shares in connection with an Award, nothing contained herein shall give any Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company. In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Shares with respect to awards hereunder.  
    
  (i)      Award Document  .  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the Plan and any Award Document, the Plan shall govern and the Award Document shall be interpreted to minimize or eliminate any such conflict or inconsistency.  
    
  (j)      Application of Funds  .  The proceeds received by the Company from the sale of Shares pursuant to Awards will be used for general corporate purposes.  
    
  (k)      Headings  .  The headings of sections herein are included solely for convenience of reference and shall not affect the meaning of any of the provisions of the Plan.  
    
  (l)      Section 409A of the Code  .  If any provision of the Plan or an Award Document contravenes any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code or could cause an Award to be subject to the interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code, such provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be modified to maintain, to the maximum extent practicable, the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. Moreover, any discretionary authority that the Committee may have pursuant to the Plan shall not be applicable to an Award that is subject to Section 409A of the Code to the extent such discretionary authority will contravene Section 409A or the regulations or guidance promulgated thereunder. With respect to any Award that provides for a deferral of compensation for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and that is payable under its terms on a Participant s termination of employment (including a Participant s termination of employment on account of retirement, if applicable), notwithstanding any provision herein or in the Participant s Award Agreement to the contrary, if at the time of payment under such an Award, the Participant is a  specified employee  (as defined below), no such payment shall occur prior to the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6) month period measured from the date of the Participant s separation from service, or (B) the date of the Participant s death. Upon the expiration of the six (6) month deferral period referred to in the preceding sentence or the Participant s death, all amounts that would otherwise have been paid during such period but for this Section 16(l) shall be paid and any amounts that remain to be paid under the Award shall be paid in accordance with the terms hereof and of the Award Document. The term  specified employee  shall have the same meaning as assigned to that term under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and whether a Participant is a specified employee shall be determined in accordance with written guidelines adopted by the Company for such purposes. 
    
  (m)      Governing Law  .  Except as to matters of federal law, the Plan and all actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada (other than its conflict of law rules).

A copy of the Plan is available to Grantee upon request and is incorporated in this Agreement by this reference.  Terms used in this Agreement that are defined in the Plan shall have the same meaning as in the Plan, unless the text of this Agreement clearly indicates otherwise. 
    
  2.  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS  . 
    
  A.  The Company hereby grants to Grantee a total of   [Number of Shares Granted]   shares of the Company s Common Stock (the  Restricted Stock ) subject to the terms and conditions set forth below. 
    
  B.  Grantee will receive a certificate identifying the number of shares of common stock issued to the Grantee as Restricted Stock. 
    
  C.  The Restricted Stock has been awarded as compensation to the Grantee for services to be rendered as a Director of the Company over the vesting period provided for herein. 
    
  D.  This Agreement sets forth the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock granted to Grantee. 
    
  3.  RESTRICTIONS  .   
    
  A.  The Restricted Stock has been awarded to the Grantee subject to the transfer and forfeiture conditions set forth in Paragraph C below (the  Restrictions ) which shall lapse, if at all, as described in Section 4 below.  For purposes of this Award, the term Restricted Stock includes any additional shares of stock granted to the Grantee with respect to any Restricted Stock (e.g., shares issued upon a stock dividend or stock split) prior to the vesting of the Restricted Stock. 
    
  B.  Grantee may not directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, voluntarily or involuntarily, sell, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise transfer (a  transfer ) any of the Restricted Stock prior to vesting as provided in Section 3 below.  Any transfer or attempted transfer prior to such time shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever.   
    
  C.  If the Grantee s service as a Director of the Company terminates prior to the vesting of all Restricted Stock of the Grantee for any reason other than as set forth in Section 4 below, then the Grantee shall forfeit all of the Grantee s right, title and interest in and to the Restricted Stock not vested as of the date of such termination and such Restricted Stock shall be reconveyed to the Company as of the date of such termination without further consideration or any act or action by the Grantee.   
    
  D.  The Restrictions imposed under this Section 3 shall apply to all shares of the Company s common stock or other securities issued with respect to Restricted Stock hereunder in connection with any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, stock dividend or other change in corporate structure affecting the common stock of the Company which occurs prior to the vesting of the Restricted Stock. 
    
  4.      EXPIRATION AND TERMINATION OF RESTRICTIONS  .  The Restrictions imposed under Section 3 above will expire and vesting of the Restricted Stock shall be as follows: 
    
  On   [the first anniversary date]  ,     the Restrictions will expire with respect to all of the Restricted Stock of the Grantee not forfeited prior to that date. 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all Restricted Stock of a Grantee shall become fully vested upon the Grantee s death or total disability or upon a  Change of Control  of the Company.  Total disability shall be defined as a physician certified disability which permanently or indefinitely renders the Grantee unable to perform his usual duties for the Company.  
    
  For purposes of this Agreement, a  Change of Control  shall be deemed to have occurred if at any time after the date this Agreement is signed: (i) by any method, transaction or series of related transactions, more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Company or beneficial ownership thereof are acquired within a period of one year by a person or group (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) other than the members of Company s Board, those persons who were more than 5% owners of the Company prior to the date of this Agreement, employees of the Company and any of their immediate family members and affiliates; (ii) there is a merger or consolidation of the Company in which the Company is not the continuing or surviving entity or in which the stockholders of the Company immediately before such transaction do not own in the aggregate at least 50% of the outstanding voting shares of the continuing or surviving entity immediately after such transaction; (iii) there is a merger or consolidation of the Company pursuant to which the Company s shares are converted into cash, securities or other property; or (iv) the Company sells, leases or exchanges all or substantially all of its assets or the Company s stockholders approve the liquidation or dissolution of the Company.   
    
  5.  ADJUSTMENTS  .  If the number of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company is changed as a result of a stock dividend, stock split or the like without additional consideration to the Company, the number of shares of Restricted Stock under this Agreement shall be adjusted to correspond to the change in the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock. 
    
  6.  VOTING AND DIVIDENDS  .  Subject to the restrictions contained in Section 3 hereof, the Grantee shall have all rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Grantee s Restricted Stock, including the right to vote the shares of the Grantee s Restricted Stock and the right to receive any cash or stock dividends, including dividends of stock of a company other than the Company.   
    
  Cash dividends shall be paid to the Grantee regardless of whether the Restricted Stock is fully vested unless the cash dividend has been determined to be an extraordinary dividend by the Board of Directors.   
    
  Stock dividends issued with respect to the Grantee s Restricted Stock shall be treated as additional shares of the Grantee s Restricted Stock (even if they are shares of a company other than the Company) that are subject to the same restrictions and other terms and conditions that apply to the shares with respect to which such dividends are issued.   
    
  If there is an extraordinary cash dividend or if a dividend is paid in property other than cash or stock, the Grantee will be credited with the amount of such extraordinary cash dividend or property which would have been received had the Grantee owned a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of Restricted Stock credited to his account.  The extraordinary cash dividend or property so credited will be subject to the same restrictions and other terms and conditions applicable to the Restricted Stock under this Agreement and will be disbursed to the Grantee in kind simultaneously with the Restricted Stock to which such extraordinary cash dividend or property relates. 
    
  7.  DELIVERY OF SHARES  .  The shares of Restricted Stock of the Grantee will be issued in the name of the Grantee as Restricted Stock and will be held by the Company prior to vesting in certificated or uncertificated form.  If a certificate for Restricted Stock is issued prior to vesting, such certificate shall be registered in the name of the Grantee and shall bear a legend in substantially the following form: 
    
   This certificate and the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to the terms and conditions (including forfeiture and restrictions against transfer) contained in a Restricted Stock Agreement dated   [Grant Date]  , between the registered owner of the shares represented hereby and Allegiant Travel Company.  Release from such terms and conditions shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such Agreement, copies of which are on file in the office of Allegiant Travel Company.  
    
  Upon request from the Company, the Grantee shall deposit with the Company a stock power, or powers, executed in blank and sufficient to reconvey the Restricted Stock to the Company upon any forfeiture of the Restricted Stock (or a portion thereof), in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  Upon vesting of any Restricted Stock, any stock certificates and stock powers relating to such vested Restricted Stock shall be released to the Grantee upon request. 
    
  8.  WITHHOLDING TAXES  .  The Company is entitled to withhold an amount equal to the Company s required minimum statutory withholding taxes (if any) for the respective tax jurisdiction attributable to any share of  

common stock or property deliverable in connection with the Restricted Stock.  Grantee may satisfy any withholding obligation in whole or in part by electing to have the Company retain shares of the Restricted Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of vesting equal to the minimum amount to be withheld.  Fair Market Value for this purpose shall be the closing price for a share of the Company s common stock on the last trading day before the date of vesting. 
    
  9.  OTHER RIGHTS  .  The grant of Restricted Stock does not confer upon Grantee any right to continue on the Board of Directors of the Company and does not interfere with the right of the Company to terminate Grantee s service on the Board at any time in accordance with the Company s By-Laws. 
    
  10.  CLAWBACK AGREEMENT  .  In accordance with the Company s clawback policy applicable to executive officers of the Company, in the event Grantee is an executive officer of the Company, then Grantee hereby agrees to reimburse the Company for all or any portion of any bonuses or incentive or equity-based compensation if the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors in good faith determines: (a) the payment or grant was based on the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a material financial restatement (other than as a result of a change in accounting principles) and a lower payment or award would have occurred based upon the restated financial results; or (b) Grantee engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct related to the Company or its business. In each such instance, the Company will, to the extent practicable and allowable under applicable law, require reimbursement of any bonus or incentive or equity based compensation awarded or effect the cancellation of any unvested or deferred stock awards previously granted to Grantee in the amount by which Grantee s bonus or incentive or equity based compensation for the relevant period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results, or such other amount as determined by the Compensation Committee, provided that the Company will not be entitled to recover bonuses or incentive or equity based compensation paid more than three years prior to the date the applicable restatement is disclosed. 
    
  11.  NOTICES  .  Any written notice under this Agreement shall be deemed given on the date that is three business days after it is sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed either to the Grantee at his address as indicated in the Company s employment records or to the Company at its principal office.  Any notice may be sent using any other means (including personal delivery, expedited courier, messenger service, telecopy, ordinary mail or electronic mail) but no such notice shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it is actually received by the intended recipient.   
    
  12.  NONTRANSFERABILITY  .  This Agreement and all rights hereunder are nontransferable and nonassignable by the Grantee, other than by the last will and testament of Grantee or the laws of descent and distribution, unless the Company consents thereto in writing.  Any transfer or attempted transfer except pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever. 
    
  13.  SECTION 83(b) ELECTION  .  Grantee may make an election to be taxed upon the grant of his Restricted Stock under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  To effect such election, the Grantee must file an appropriate election with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days after the grant of the Restricted Stock and otherwise in accordance with the applicable Treasury Regulations. 
    
  14.  AMENDMENT  .  This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by the Company and Grantee. 
    
  15.  HEIRS AND SUCCESSORS  .  Subject to Section 10 above, this Agreement and all terms and conditions hereof shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns, and upon the Grantee and their heirs, legatees and legal representatives. 
    
  16.  INTERPRETATION  .  Any issues of interpretation of any provision of this Agreement shall be resolved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. 
    
  17.  SEVERABILITY  .  The provisions of this Agreement, and of each separate section and subsection, are severable, and if any one or more provisions may be determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions, and any unenforceable provisions to the extent enforceable, shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable. 

18.  GOVERNING LAW  .  All questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the internal law and not the law of conflicts of the State of Nevada. 
    
  19.  WAIVER  .  The failure of the Company to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of such provision or any other provision hereof. 
    
  20.  DEEMED SIGNATURE; COUNTERPARTS  .    It is contemplated that the Grantee will confirm his/her acceptance of the restricted stock grant evidenced hereby and the terms of this Agreement by logging onto the Plan administrator s website and electronically indicating his/her acceptance. As the Grantee s information on the Plan administrator s website is password protected, such acceptance shall be deemed to be the Grantee s acceptance absent Grantee s ability to establish that he/she did not accept this Agreement and that whoever indicated such acceptance did so without the Grantee s knowledge or acquiescence. Further, the acceptance by Grantee of any benefits from the ownership of stock granted under this Agreement (whether by voting the Restricted Stock, accepting dividends on the Restricted Stock, selling any shares of Restricted Stock or otherwise) shall also be deemed a confirmation by Grantee of his/her intent to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.   If this Agreement is physically signed (which is not required), then it may be executed in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if all parties hereto had signed the same document, and all counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute one instrument.  If this Agreement is physically signed (which is not required), this Agreement may be executed by any party by delivery of a facsimile or pdf signature, which signature shall have the same force as an original signature.  Any party which delivers a facsimile or pdf signature shall promptly thereafter deliver an originally executed signature to the other parties; provided, however, that the failure to deliver an original signature page shall not affect the validity of any signature delivered by facsimile or pdf.  A facsimile, pdf or photocopied signature shall be deemed to be the functional equivalent of an original for all purposes. 
    
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has executed this Agreement as of day and year first above written.

  F.      Termination of Employment as a Result of Death or Disability  .  In the event of the death or disability of the Optionee while in the employ of the Company, the personal representative of the Optionee (in the event of Optionee s death) or the Optionee (in the event of Optionee s disability) may, subject to the provisions hereof and before the earlier of the Option's expiration date or the expiration of one (1) year after the date of such death or disability, exercise the Option granted to the Optionee to the same extent the Optionee might have exercised such Option on the date of Optionee s death or disability (  i.e.  , to the extent then vested), but not further or otherwise.  To the extent any portion of the Option is not exercisable at the date of the death or disability of the Optionee (  i.e.  , to the extent not then vested), such nonvested portion of the Option shall terminate on the date of death or disability.  To the extent any portion of the Option is not exercised within the time period provided, such portion of the Option shall terminate as of the date of expiration of such time period.  For purposes of this Paragraph F, the Optionee shall be considered to be subject to a disability when the Optionee is disabled within the meaning of Code Section 22(e)(3), and the date of any such disability shall be deemed to be the day following the last day the Optionee performed services for the Company.

  23.  Deemed Signature; Counterparts  .    It is contemplated that the Optionee will confirm his/her acceptance of the option grant evidenced hereby and the terms of this Agreement by logging onto the Plan administrator s website and electronically indicating his/her acceptance. As the Optionee s information on the Plan administrator s website is password protected, such acceptance shall be deemed to be the Optionee s acceptance absent Optionee s ability to establish that he/she did not accept this Agreement and that whoever indicated such acceptance did so without the Optionee s knowledge or acquiescence.

If this Agreement is physically signed (which is not required), this Agreement may be executed by any party by delivery of a facsimile or pdf signature, which signature shall have the same force as an original signature.  Any party which delivers a facsimile or pdf signature shall promptly thereafter deliver an originally executed signature to the other parties; provided, however, that the failure to deliver an original signature page shall not affect the validity of any signature delivered by facsimile or pdf.  A facsimile, pdf or photocopied signature shall be deemed to be the functional equivalent of an original for all purposes. 
    
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed on the date first above written.

  13.  WITHHOLDING TAXES  .  The Company is entitled to withhold an amount equal to the Company s required minimum statutory withholding taxes for the respective tax jurisdiction attributable to any share of common stock or property deliverable in connection with the Restricted Stock.

In accordance with the Company s clawback policy applicable to executive officers of the Company, in the event Grantee is an executive officer of the Company, then Grantee hereby agrees to reimburse the Company for all or any portion of any bonuses or incentive or equity-based compensation if the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors in good faith determines: (a) the payment or grant was based on the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a material financial restatement (other than as a result of a change in accounting principles) and a lower payment or award would have occurred based upon the restated financial results; or (b) Grantee engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct related to the Company or its business. In each such instance, the Company will, to the extent practicable and allowable under applicable law, require reimbursement of any bonus or incentive or equity based compensation awarded or effect the cancellation of any unvested or deferred stock awards previously granted to Grantee in the amount by which Grantee s bonus or incentive or equity based compensation for the relevant period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results, or such other amount as determined by the Compensation  

Committee, provided that the Company will not be entitled to recover bonuses or incentive or equity based compensation paid more than three years prior to the date the applicable restatement is disclosed.

The SARs consist of the right to receive, upon exercise of the SAR (or any portion thereof) a cash payment equal to the number of SARs being exercised multiplied by the excess of the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) of the Common Stock on the date upon which the Participant exercises the SAR (or any portion thereof) over the Exercise Price.  The SARs shall only be settled in cash and not in shares of Common Stock in the Company or any other property.

Further, the number of Shares to which the SARs granted hereunder relate and the Exercise Price per Share may be equitably adjusted, in the sole discretion of the Committee, in the event of an extraordinary dividend, split-up, spin-off, warrants or rights offering to purchase Shares at a price substantially below Fair Market Value or other similar corporate event affecting the Shares, in each case in order to preserve, but not increase, the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available to Participant under this Agreement. With respect to any such adjustments to be made in the discretion of the Committee, such adjustments shall be made by the Committee, in its sole discretion, whose determination as to what adjustments shall be made, and the extent thereof, shall be final. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, such adjusted awards shall be subject to the same restrictions and vesting or settlement schedule to which the underlying award is subject.
