1. NATURE OF THE BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  Nature of the Business 
    
  Steel Partners Holdings L.P. ("SPLP" or "Company") is a diversified global holding company that engages in multiple businesses through consolidated subsidiaries, associated companies and other interests. It owns and operates businesses and has significant interests in companies in various industries, including diversified industrial products, energy, defense, supply chain management and logistics, banking and youth sports. SPLP operates through the following segments: Diversified Industrial, Energy, Financial Services, and Corporate and Other, which are managed separately and offer different products and services. For additional details related to the Company's reportable segments see Note 17 - "Segment Information." Steel Partners Holdings GP Inc. ("SPH GP"), a Delaware corporation, is the general partner of SPLP and is wholly-owned by SPLP. The Company is managed by SP General Services LLC ("Manager"), pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated management agreement ("Management Agreement") discussed in further detail in Note 16 - "Related Party Transactions." 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") have been condensed or omitted in accordance with those rules and regulations. The Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. This quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Certain amounts for the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
    
  In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position and the results of operations and changes in cash flows for the interim periods. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on historical experience, expected future cash flows and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The results of operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. 
    
  During 2015, one of the Company's subsidiaries, Steel Excel Inc. ("Steel Excel"), identified an error related to the manner in which the provision for income taxes had reflected the tax effects related to unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities during 2014 and 2013. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment to correct the error in the first quarter of 2015 to its tax provision of approximately   $3,500  , which is included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority or wholly-owned subsidiaries, which include the following: 

7 

(a) 
    DGT's financial statements are recorded on a two-month lag, and as a result, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statements of Operations as of and for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   includes DGT's activity as of and for its three and   nine   months ended July 31, 2016. 
              (b) 
    WFHC owns   100%   of WebBank ("WebBank") and   100%   of WebFinancial Holding LLC ("WFH LLC") (formerly CoSine Communications, Inc.), which operates through its subsidiary API Group plc ("API"). 
       
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and the guidance defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. The ASU, as amended, is effective for the Company's 2018 fiscal year and may be applied either (i) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented with an election for certain specified practical expedients, or (ii) retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU recognized at the date of initial application, with additional disclosure requirements. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance, but does not currently anticipate that the application of ASU No. 2014-09 will have a significant effect on its financial condition, results of operations or its cash flows. We have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  , which requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The amendments do not apply to inventory that is measured using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") cost method. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance, which is effective for the Company's 2017 fiscal year. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  , which eliminates the requirement to restate prior-period financial statements for measurement-period adjustments following a business combination. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement-period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The prior-period impact of the adjustment should either be presented separately on the face of the statement of operations or disclosed in the notes. This new guidance is effective for the Company's 2016 fiscal year. The amendments in this ASU will be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur in 2016 and thereafter. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments Overall (Topic 825): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which requires certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The new standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment and requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance, which is effective for the Company's 2018 fiscal year. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . The new standard establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis, on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for capital and operating leases existing at the date of adoption, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance, which is effective for the Company's 2019 fiscal year. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This new standard simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows, among other things. The new standard is effective for the Company's 2017 fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurements of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The new standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and loan receivables, from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model and adds certain new required disclosures. Under the expected loss model, entities will recognize estimated credit losses  
  
   8 

to be incurred over the entire contractual term of the instrument rather than delaying recognition of credit losses until it is probable the loss has been incurred. In addition, the new standard requires recording credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities through an allowance account. The new standard is effective for the Company's 2020 fiscal year with early adoption permitted for all entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   This new standard provides guidance to help decrease diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU No. 2016-15 provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. The new standard is effective for the Company's 2018 fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance. 

2. ACQUISITIONS 
    
  2016 Acquisitions 
    
  HNH's Acquisition of EME 
    
  On September 30, 2016, SL Montevideo Technology, Inc. ("SMTI"), a subsidiary of SL Industries, Inc. ("SLI") (which was acquired by HNH in June 2016 as discussed further below), entered into an asset purchase agreement ("Purchase Agreement") with Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation ("Hamilton"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, SMTI acquired from Hamilton certain assets of its Electromagnetic Enterprise division ("EME") used or useful in the design, development, manufacture, marketing, service, distribution, repair, and sale of electric motors, starters and generators for certain commercial applications, including for use in commercial hybrid electric vehicles and refrigeration and in the aerospace and defense sectors. The acquisition of EME expands SLI's product portfolio and diversifies its customer base. SMTI purchased the acquired net assets for   $64,500   in cash and assumption of certain ordinary course business liabilities, subject to adjustments related to working capital at closing and quality of earnings of the acquired business for the period of January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016, each as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement includes a guarantee by Hamilton of a minimum level of product purchases from SMTI by an affiliate of Hamilton for calendar years 2017, 2018, and 2019, in exchange for compliance by SMTI with certain operating covenants. The transaction was financed with additional borrowings under HNH's senior secured revolving credit facility. 
    
  The following table summarizes the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date on a preliminary basis: 

The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to finalization of valuations of certain acquired assets and liabilities. The goodwill of   $32,686   arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies expected from combining the operations of SLI and EME. The goodwill is assigned to the Company's Diversified Industrial segment and is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Other intangibles consist solely of customer relationships of   $28,820  . These customer relationships have been assigned a useful life of   15   years based on the limited turnover and long-standing relationships EME has with its existing customer base. The acquired customer relationships were valued using an excess earnings approach, and significant assumptions used in the valuation included the customer attrition rate assumed and the expected level of future sales. 
    
  No net sales or operating income of the acquired business are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 based on the acquisition date. The future results of operations of the acquired business will be reported within the Company's Diversified Industrial segment. 
    
  API's Acquisition of Hazen Paper Company 

9 

On July 27, 2016, API acquired Hazen Paper Company's ("Hazen") lamination facility and business in Osgood, Indiana for approximately   $14,000  . The acquisition, which is not material to SPLP's operations, is part of API's strategy to focus on brand enhancement solutions for the packaging market, and it enables API to provide a combined foils and laminate offering to customers in the U.S., while giving broader coverage for its global customers. In connection with the Hazen acquisition, the Company has recorded property, plant and equipment, other intangible assets (primarily customer relationships) and goodwill totaling approximately   $6,200  ,   $2,700   and   $4,100  , respectively. 
    
  HNH's Acquisition of SLI 
    
  On April 6, 2016, HNH entered into a definitive merger agreement with SLI, pursuant to which it commenced a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of SLI's common stock, at a purchase price of   $40.00   per share in cash ("Offer"). SLI designs, manufactures and markets power electronics, motion control, power protection, power quality electromagnetic equipment, and custom gears and gearboxes that are used in a variety of medical, commercial and military aerospace, computer, datacom, industrial, architectural and entertainment lighting, and telecom applications. Consummation of the Offer was subject to certain conditions, including the tender of a number of shares that constituted at least (1) a majority of SLI's outstanding shares and (2)   60%   of SLI's outstanding shares not owned by HNH or any of its affiliates, as well as other customary conditions. SPLP beneficially owned approximately   25.1%   of SLI's outstanding shares. 
    
  On June 1, 2016, the conditions noted above, as well as all other conditions to the Offer were satisfied, and HNH successfully completed its tender offer through a wholly-owned subsidiary. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the wholly-owned subsidiary merged with and into SLI, with SLI being the surviving corporation ("SLI Merger"). Upon completion of the SLI Merger, SLI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of HNH. 
    
  The total merger consideration was approximately   $161,985  , excluding related transaction fees and expenses. The merger consideration represents the aggregate cash merger consideration of approximately   $122,191   paid by HNH to non-affiliates and the fair value of SPLP's previously held interest in SLI of approximately   $39,794  . The funds necessary to consummate the Offer, the SLI Merger and to pay related fees and expenses were financed with additional borrowings under HNH's senior secured revolving credit facility. 
    
  The following table summarizes the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date on a preliminary basis: 

The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to finalization of valuations of certain acquired assets and liabilities. The goodwill of   $54,317   arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies expected from combining the operations of HNH and SLI. The goodwill is assigned to the Company's Diversified Industrial segment and is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Other intangibles consist primarily of acquired trade names of approximately   $14,600  , customer relationships of approximately   $59,500  , developed technology and patents of approximately   $10,600     and customer order backlog of   $3,100  . The customer order backlog is being amortized based on the expected period over which the orders will be fulfilled, ranging from  
  
   10 

two to eight months. The remaining intangible assets have been assigned useful lives ranging from   10   to   15   years based on the long operating history, broad market recognition and continued demand for the associated brands, and the limited turnover and long-standing relationships SLI has with its existing customer base. The valuations of acquired trade names and developed technology and patents were performed utilizing a relief from royalty method, and significant assumptions used in the valuation included the royalty rate assumed and the expected level of future sales, as well as the rate of technical obsolescence for the developed technology and patents. The acquired customer relationships were valued using an excess earnings approach, and significant assumptions used in the valuation included the customer attrition rate assumed and the expected level of future sales. Included in Accrued liabilities and Other non-current liabilities above is a total of   $7,500   for existing and contingent liabilities relating to SLI's environmental matters, which are further discussed in Note 15 - "Commitments and Contingencies." 
    
  The amount of net sales and operating income of the acquired business included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately   $48,300   and   $200  . The amount of net sales and operating loss of the acquired business included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately   $60,100   and   $3,000  . The operating loss for the nine-month period includes   $1,900   of expenses associated with the amortization of the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventories. The operating loss for the nine-month period also includes   $1,900   of expenses associated with the acceleration of SLI's previously outstanding stock-based compensation awards, which became fully vested on the date of acquisition pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, and which are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's 2016 Consolidated Statements of Operations. The results of operations of the acquired business are reported within the Company's Diversified Industrial segment. 
    
  2015 Acquisitions 
    
  HNH's Acquisition of JPS 
    
  Effective July 2, 2015, HNH completed the acquisition of JPS Industries, Inc. ("JPS") pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of May 31, 2015. JPS is a major U.S. manufacturer of mechanically formed glass and aramid substrate materials for specialty applications in a wide expanse of markets requiring highly engineered components. At the effective time of the Merger (as defined below), HNH's acquisition subsidiary was merged with and into JPS ("Merger"), with JPS being the surviving corporation in the Merger, and each outstanding share of JPS common stock (other than shares held by HNH and its affiliates, including SPH Group Holdings LLC ("SPH Group Holdings"), a subsidiary of SPLP, and a significant stockholder of JPS), was converted into the right to receive   $11.00   in cash. The total merger consideration was   $114,493  , which represents the aggregate cash merger consideration of   $70,255   and the fair value of SPLP's previously held interest in JPS of   $44,238  . The cash consideration was funded by HNH and SPH Group Holdings. SPH Group Holding's funding of the aggregate merger consideration totaled approximately   $4,510  , with the remainder funded by HNH, financed through additional borrowings under HNH's senior secured revolving credit facility. 
    
  As a result of the closing of the Merger, JPS was indirectly owned by both HNH and SPH Group Holdings. Following the expiration of the 20-day period provided in Section 262(d)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law for JPS stockholders to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger, and in accordance with an exchange agreement, dated as of May 31, 2015, by and between HNH and SPH Group Holdings, on July 31, 2015, HNH exchanged   1,429,407   shares of HNH's common stock with a value of   $48,700   for all shares of JPS common stock held by SPH Group Holdings. As a result of the exchange, HNH owns   100%   of JPS. 
    
  The following table summarizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date: 
  
   11 

The goodwill of   $32,162   arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies expected from combining the operations of HNH and JPS. The goodwill is assigned to SPLP's Diversified Industrial segment and is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Other intangible assets consist primarily of acquired trade names of approximately   $4,300  , customer relationships of approximately   $3,100  , and developed technology of approximately   $1,700  . These intangible assets have been assigned useful lives ranging from   10   to   15   years based on the long operating history, broad market recognition and continued demand for the associated brands, and the limited turnover and longstanding relationships JPS has with its existing customer base. The valuations of acquired trade names and developed technology were performed utilizing a relief from royalty method, and significant assumptions used in the valuation included the royalty rate assumed and the expected level of future sales, as well as the rate of technical obsolescence for the developed technology. The acquired customer relationships were valued using an excess earnings approach, and significant assumptions used in the valuation included the customer attrition rate assumed and the expected level of future sales. 
    
  The amount of net sales and operating loss of the acquired business included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were approximately   $28,100   and   $2,300  , respectively, which include   $3,300   of nonrecurring expense related to the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventories. The results of operations of the acquired business are reported within the Company's Diversified Industrial segment. 
    
  CoSine Acquisition 
    
  On January 20, 2015 ("CoSine Acquisition Date"), the Company entered into a contribution agreement ("Contribution Agreement") with CoSine Communications, Inc. ("CoSine"). Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the Company contributed (i)   24,807,203   ordinary shares of API and (ii)   445,456   shares of common stock of Nathan's Famous, Inc. ("Nathan's") to CoSine in exchange for   16,500,000   shares of newly issued CoSine common stock and   12,761   shares of newly issued   7.5%   series B non-voting preferred stock, which increased SPLP's ownership of CoSine to approximately   80%  . Prior to obtaining a controlling interest, SPLP owned approximately   48%   of the outstanding shares of CoSine, and its investment was accounted for under the traditional equity method. As a result of the above transaction, CoSine became a majority-owned, controlled subsidiary and is consolidated with SPLP from the CoSine Acquisition Date. Prior to CoSine's acquisition of API discussed below, CoSine was included in the Corporate and Other segment. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, CoSine is included in the Diversified Industrial segment. 
    
  The Contribution Agreement was the first step in a plan for a wholly-owned UK subsidiary of CoSine ("BidCo") to make an offer, which commenced on February 4, 2015, to acquire all of the issued and to be issued shares in API for   60   pence in cash per API share not already owned by BidCo. As a result of the offer, BidCo owned approximately   98%   of API as of March 31, 2015, however, CoSine did not obtain control over the operations of API until April 17, 2015 (see the "CoSine's Acquisition of API" section below). 
    
  As of the CoSine Acquisition Date, the fair value of the Company's previously held equity interest and the noncontrolling interest in CoSine were valued at approximately   $2.51   per share. Accordingly, the Company remeasured its previously held equity  
  
   12 

interest to a fair value of approximately   $12,011  , resulting in an investment gain, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015, of approximately   $6,900   and is included in Net investment (losses) gains in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  The consideration paid to acquire the controlling interest in CoSine was   $66,239  , which was comprised of   $12,011   related to the fair value of the previously held common equity of CoSine,   $22,823   for the fair value of the API shares transferred to CoSine and   $31,405   for the fair value of the Nathan's shares transferred to CoSine. The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the CoSine Acquisition Date, as well as the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in CoSine: 

CoSine's Acquisition of API 
    
  As discussed above, CoSine obtained control over the operations of API on April 17, 2015 ("API Acquisition Date"), at which time API became a consolidated subsidiary of CoSine. API is a manufacturer and distributor of foils, films and laminates used to enhance the visual appeal of products and packaging. API is headquartered in Cheshire, England. The table below details the consideration paid to acquire the controlling interest in API: 

The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the API Acquisition Date: 

13 

All of the goodwill is assigned to SPLP's Diversified Industrial segment and is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Other intangible assets consist primarily of acquired trade names of approximately   $5,100   and customer relationships of approximately   $17,700  . Based on our evaluation, the trade names have been assigned a   10  -year useful life based on the long operating history, broad market recognition and continued demand for the associated brands, and customer relationships have been assigned a   7  -year life based on the expected turnover of API's existing customer base. The valuation of acquired trade names was performed utilizing a relief from royalty method, and significant assumptions used in the valuation included the royalty rate assumed and the expected level of future sales. The acquired customer relationships were valued using an excess earnings approach, and significant assumptions used in the valuation included the customer attrition rate assumed and the expected level of future sales. 
    
  Pro Forma Results 
    
  The following unaudited pro forma data is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the results of future operations or of the results that would have occurred had the JPS and API acquisitions taken place on January 1, 2014 and the SLI and EME acquisitions taken place on January 1, 2015. The information for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is based on historical financial information with respect to the acquisitions and does not include operational or other changes which might have been effected by the Company. The supplemental unaudited pro forma earnings for both periods were adjusted to reflect incremental depreciation and amortization expense based on the fair value adjustments for the acquired property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which are amortized using the double-declining balance method for customer relationships and the straight line method for other intangibles, over periods principally ranging from   10   to   15   years, except for the customer order backlog, which is amortized over periods ranging from   two   to   eight   months. The supplemental unaudited proforma earnings were also adjusted to reflect incremental interest expense on the borrowings made to finance the acquisitions. 
    
  The supplemental unaudited pro forma earnings exclude a total of   $6,900   of acquisition-related costs incurred by HNH, SLI and EME during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . The 2016 supplemental unaudited pro forma earnings further reflect adjustments to exclude   $1,900   of nonrecurring expense related to SLI's amortization of the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventories, as well as   $1,900   in expense associated with the acceleration of SLI's previously outstanding stock-based compensation awards. The 2015 supplemental unaudited pro forma earnings were adjusted to include both the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventories and the expense associated with the acceleration of SLI's previously outstanding stock-based compensation awards. The 2015 supplemental unaudited pro forma earnings also reflect adjustments to exclude a total of   $8,700   of acquisition related costs incurred by HNH, JPS, SLI and API during the nine months of 2015 and   $4,375   of nonrecurring expense related to JPS's and API's amortization of the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventories. 

3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES 
    
  Discontinued Operations 
    
  Discontinued operations in 2015 include the operations of Arlon, LLC ("Arlon"), a manufacturer of high performance materials for the printed circuit board industry and silicone rubber-based materials, which was part of SPLP's Diversified Industrial segment. On December 18, 2014, HNH entered into a contract to sell its Arlon business for   $157,000   in cash, less transaction fees, subject to a final working capital adjustment and certain potential reductions as provided in the stock purchase agreement, which are reflected in proceeds from sale of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The closing occurred in January 2015. 

14 

Asset Impairment Charges 
    
  In connection with HNH's continued integration of JPS, HNH approved the closure of JPS' Slater, South Carolina operating facility during the second quarter of 2016 and recorded impairment charges totaling approximately   $7,900   associated with the planned closure, including write-downs of   $6,600   to property, plant, and equipment and   $400   to intangible assets, as well as a   $900   inventory write-down, which was recorded in Cost of goods sold in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  Due to improved operational productivity and available capacity at Lucas-Milhaupt facilities, HNH has approved the closure of its Lucas-Milhaupt Gliwice, Poland operating facility as part of its continual focus to optimize infrastructure costs. During the third quarter of 2016, HNH recorded asset impairment charges totaling   $3,557  , primarily due to write-downs of   $1,500   to property, plant, and equipment and   $500   to inventories, associated with the planned closure. The inventory write-down was recorded in Cost of goods sold in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
    
  Sale of API's Security Holographics Business 
    
  In April 2016, API sold its security holographics business for approximately   $8,000   and recorded a gain of approximately   $2,800  , which is recorded in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. API's security holographics business created custom optical security solutions to protect secure documents and premium products against counterfeit and fraud and it was included in the Company's Diversified Industrial segment. The sale was part of API's strategy to focus on its decorative holographic offerings for the packaging market. The operations of this business were not significant to the consolidated financial statements of SPLP. 

4. LOANS RECEIVABLE, INCLUDING LOANS HELD FOR SALE 
    
  Major classification of WebBank's loans receivable, including loans held for sale, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows: 

(a) 
    The carrying value is considered to be representative of fair value because the rates of interest are not significantly different from market interest rates for instruments with similar maturities. The fair value of loans receivable, including loans held for sale, net was   $189,879   and   $226,541   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
       
  Loans with a carrying value of approximately   $57,522   and   $63,393   were pledged as collateral for potential borrowings at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. WebBank serviced   $19,770   in loans for others at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Allowance for Loan Losses ("ALLL") represents an estimate of probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The amount of the ALLL is established by analyzing the portfolio at least quarterly and a provision for or reduction of loan losses is recorded so that the ALLL is at an appropriate level at the balance sheet date. The increase in the ALLL was due to an increase in existing impaired loans and the addition of a loan portfolio of held-to-maturity consumer loans. There have been no other significant changes in the credit quality of loans in the loan portfolio since   December 31, 2015  .

5. INVENTORIES, NET 
    
  A summary of Inventories, net is as follows: 

Fine and Fabricated Precious Metal Inventory 
    
  In order to produce certain of its products, HNH purchases, maintains and utilizes     precious     metal inventory. HNH records certain     precious     metal inven  tory at the lower of LIFO cost or market, with any adjustments recorded through Cost of goods sold. Remaining precious metal inventory is accounted for primarily at fair value. 
    
  Certain customers and suppliers of HNH choose to do business on a     "  pool  "     basis. Such customers or suppliers furnish     precious     metal to HNH for return in fabricated form or for purchase from or return to the supplier. When the customer's precious metal is returned in fabricated form, the customer is charged a fabrication charge. The value of pooled precious metal is not included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent HNH is able to utilize customer precious metal in its production process, such custome  r metal replaces the need for HNH to purchase its own inventory. As of   September 30, 2016  , customer metal in HNH's custody consisted of   139,450   ounces of silver,   520   ounces of gold and   1,391   ounces of p  alladium. 

6. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET 
    
  A reconciliation of the change in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment is as follows: 

(a) 
    Goodwill from acquisitions during 2016 relates to HNH's acquisitions of SLI and EME, as well as API's acquisition of Hazen. The goodwill recorded for these acquisitions is subject to adjustment during the finalization of the purchase price allocations. For additional information, see Note 2 - "Acquisitions." 
       
  A summary of Other intangible assets, net is as follows: 
  
   16 

Other intangible assets, net as of   September 30, 2016   includes approximately   $119,400   in intangible assets, primarily trade names, customer relationships, and developed technology and patents, associated with the SLI, EME and Hazen acquisitions. These balances are subject to adjustment during the finalization of the purchase price allocations for the SLI, EME and Hazen acquisitions. 
    
  Trademarks with indefinite lives as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $8,020  . Amortization expense related to intangible assets was   $9,360   and   $4,512   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $18,332   and   $11,864   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in amortization expense during 2016 was principally due to the Company's recent acquisitions discussed in Note 2 - "Acquisitions." Future amortization expense of the intangible assets acquired in the SLI and EME acquisitions is expected to total   $4,200   for the remainder of 2016,   $13,300  ,   $11,600  ,   $10,300  ,   $9,200  , and   $62,600   in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and thereafter, respectively. 

7. INVESTMENTS 
    
  A) Short-Term Investments 
    
  Marketable Securities 
    
  The Company's short-term investments primarily consist of its marketable securities portfolio held by its subsidiary, Steel Excel. These marketable securities as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are classified as available-for-sale securities, with changes in fair value recognized in Partners' Capital as Other comprehensive income (loss), except for other-than-temporary impairments, which are reflected as a reduction of cost and charged to the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The classification of marketable securities as a current asset is based on the intended holding period and realizability of the investment. The Company's portfolio of marketable securities was as follows: 

Proceeds from sales of marketable securities were   $3,100   and   $22,800   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and were   $47,200   and   $72,602   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company determines gains and losses from sales of marketable securities based on specific identification of the securities sold. Gross realized gains and losses from sales of marketable securities, all of which are reported as a component of Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, were as follows: 
  
   17 

The fair value of marketable securities with unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016  , and the duration of time that such losses had been unrealized, were as follows: 

The fair value of marketable securities with unrealized losses at   December 31, 2015  , all of which had unrealized losses for a period of less than twelve months, were as follows: 

The gross unrealized losses primarily related to losses on corporate securities and corporate obligations, which primarily consist of investments in equity and debt securities of publicly-traded entities. Based on Steel Excel's evaluation of such securities, it determined that certain unrealized losses represented other-than-temporary impairments. This determination was based on several factors, including adverse changes in the market conditions and economic environments in which the entities operate. Steel Excel recognized asset impairment charges of approximately   $1,500   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and approximately   $7,900   and   $30,600   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, equal to the cost basis of such securities in excess of their fair values. Steel Excel has determined that there was no indication of other-than-temporary impairments on its other investments with unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016  . This determination was based on several factors, including the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the entity, and the intent and ability to hold the corporate securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.  
    
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities and marketable securities as of   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity, were as follows: 

B) Long-Term Investments 
    
  The following table summarizes the Company's long-term investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . For those investments at fair value, the carrying amount of the investment equals its respective fair value.

   19 

Fair Value Changes Recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
    
  For purposes of determining gross realized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on specific identification. Gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCI") in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. In January 2015, the Company contributed Nathan's, one of its available-for-sale securities, to CoSine in exchange for additional CoSine equity (see Note 2 - "Acquisitions" for additional information). Also, in the nine months of 2015, Cosine sold all   445,456   shares of Nathan's for proceeds of approximately   $33,202   and received a special dividend of approximately   $5,500   which is included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . As a result, management determined there to be an other-than-temporary impairment in the stock price and recorded an impairment charge of approximately   $5,500  . 
    
  The cost basis and gross unrealized gains and losses related to our available-for-sale securities, which are classified as long-term investments, are as follows: 

Fair Value Changes Recorded in Consolidated Statement of Operations  
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company purchased approximately   $3,500   of available-for-sale convertible debt securities. These securities are publicly traded and are convertible into common equity of the investee. The Company elected the fair value option to account for these convertible debt securities and, accordingly, changes in fair value are reported in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in Income (loss) from investments held at fair value. Also, prior to its acquisition in the second quarter of 2015, the Company's investment in API was accounted for as an available-for-sale security under the fair value option (see Note 2 - "Acquisitions" for additional information on the acquisition of API). 
    
  (2) EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS 
    
  Investments in Associated Companies 
    
  The Company's investments in associated companies are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company elected to record certain investments under the equity method at fair value beginning on the dates these investments became subject to the equity method. Associated companies are included in the Diversified Industrial, Energy or, Corporate and Other segments. Certain associated companies have a fiscal year end that differs from December 31. Additional information for each of SPLP's investments in associated companies as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 
    
  Traditional Equity Method: 

Steel Excel has an investment in iGo, a provider of accessories for mobile devices. This investment is being accounted for under the traditional equity method as an associated company. Based on the closing market price of iGo's publicly-traded shares, the fair value of the investment in iGo was approximately   $4,100   and   $3,900   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

collateralized by first priority security interests in and liens upon present and future assets of HNH and these subsidiaries. The Senior Credit Facility restricts HNH's ability to transfer cash or other assets to HNH, subject to certain exceptions including required pension payments to the WHX Corporation Pension Plan. The Senior Credit Facility is subject to certain mandatory prepayment provisions and restrictive and financial covenants, which include a maximum ratio limit on Total Leverage and a minimum ratio limit on Fixed Charge Coverage, as defined, as well as a minimum liquidity level. HNH was in compliance with all debt covenants at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The increase in the amount outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was principally attributable to the SLI and EME acquisitions discussed in Note 2 - "Acquisitions." 
    
  Interest Rate Swap Agreements 
    
  HNH entered into an interest rate swap agreement in February 2013 to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Under the interest rate swap, HNH received   one-month   LIBOR in exchange for a fixed interest rate of   0.569%   over the life of the agreement on an initial   $56,400   notional amount of debt, with the notional amount decreasing by   $1,100  ,   $1,800   and   $2,200   per quarter in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. HNH entered into a second interest rate swap agreement in June 2013, also to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Under the interest rate swap, HNH received   one-month LIBOR   in exchange for a fixed interest rate of   0.598%   over the life of the agreement on an initial   $5,000   notional amount of debt, with the notional amount decreasing by   $100  ,   $200   and   $200   per quarter in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Both agreements expired in February 2016. 
    
  Master Lease Agreement 
    
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, HNH entered into a master lease agreement with TD Equipment Finance, Inc. ("TD Equipment"), which establishes the general terms and conditions for a   $10,000   credit facility under which HNH may lease equipment and other property from TD Equipment pursuant to the terms of individual lease schedules. As of September 30, 2016, no leases had been entered into under the master lease agreement. 
    
  Steel Excel Loans 
    
  Steel Excel's energy business has a credit agreement, as amended ("Amended Credit Agreement"), that provides for a borrowing capacity of   $105,000  , consisting of a   $95,000   secured term loan ("Term Loan") and up to   $10,000   in revolving loans ("Revolving Loans"), subject to a borrowing base of   85%   of the eligible trade receivables. 
    
  Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement are collateralized by substantially all the assets of Steel Energy Ltd. ("Steel Energy") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Sun Well Service, Inc. ("Sun Well"), Rogue Pressure Services, Ltd. ("Rogue") and Black Hawk Energy Services Ltd. ("Black Hawk Ltd"), and a pledge of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Sun Well, Rogue and Black Hawk Ltd. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement are fully guaranteed by Sun Well, Rogue and Black Hawk Ltd. The carrying value as of   September 30, 2016   of the assets pledged as collateral by Steel Energy and its subsidiaries under the Amended Credit Agreement was approximately   $133,354  . 
    
  The Amended Credit Agreement has a term that runs through July 2018, with the Term Loan amortizing in quarterly installments of   $3,300   and a balloon payment due on the maturity date. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $42,900   was outstanding under the Term Loan and no amount was outstanding under the Revolving Loans. Required principal payments under the Amended Credit Agreement are   $0  ,   $3,303   and   $39,643   for the remainder of 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at annual rates of either (i) the Base Rate plus an applicable margin of   1.50%   to   2.25%   or (ii) LIBOR plus an applicable margin of   2.50%   to   3.25%  . The "Base Rate" is the greatest of (i) the prime lending rate, (ii) the   Federal Funds Rate   plus   0.50%  , and (iii) the   one-month LIBOR   plus   1.00%  . The applicable margin for both Base Rate and LIBOR is determined based on the leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the Amended Credit Agreement. LIBOR-based borrowings are available for interest periods of one, three, or six months. In addition, Steel Excel is required to pay commitment fees of between   0.375%   and   0.50%   per annum on the daily unused amount of the Revolving Loans. The interest rate on the borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement was   3.00%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  API Long-Term Debt Facilities 
    
  Revolving Facilities 
    
  API, in the UK, has a multi-currency revolving agreement of    13,500   (approximately   $17,500  ) that expires on December 31, 2017. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $5,839   was outstanding under the facility. The interest rate on the borrowings  
  
   23 

under the UK facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin of between   1.50%   to   2.40%  , and the interest rate was approximately   1.80%   at   September 30, 2016  . These borrowings are secured by certain UK assets, which totaled approximately   $40,000   at   September 30, 2016  , and include certain debt covenants, including leverage and interest cover. API was in compliance with all covenants at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  API also has a revolving facility in the U.S. that expires in June 2018, of up to approximately   $4,500   as of   September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   $2,010   was outstanding under the U.S. facility at an interest rate of   3.50%  . The interest rate on the borrowings under the U.S facility bear interest at LIBOR plus   3.00%  . The U.S. facility is secured by certain inventories and receivables, which totaled approximately   $12,300   at   September 30, 2016  . The facility was amended in October 2015 to modify and add certain covenants and provisions that were in place until June 30, 2016. 
    
  Term Loans 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, API entered into a term loan in the U.S. totaling approximately   $9,000   to partially fund its acquisition of Hazen (see Note 2 - "Acquisitions"). This term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus   3.00%   and had an interest rate of   3.50%   at   September 30, 2016  . In addition, API has certain term loans for equipment for approximately   $1,305   and   $1,009   at September 30, 2016. These loans had interest rates of   3.50%   and   4.30%   at   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and are secured over the related equipment. 

9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , financial instrument liabilities and related restricted cash consists primarily of   $12,446   and   $21,639  , respectively, of short sales of corporate securities. Activity is summarized below for financial instrument liabilities and related restricted cash: 

Short Sales of Corporate Securities 
    
  From time to time, Steel Excel enters into short sale transactions on certain corporate securities in which Steel Excel receives proceeds from the sale of such securities and incurs obligations to deliver such securities at a later date. Upon initially entering into such short sale transactions, Steel Excel recognizes a liability equal to the fair value of the obligation, with a comparable amount of cash and cash equivalents reclassified as restricted cash. Subsequent changes in the fair value of such obligations, determined based on the closing market price of the securities, are recognized currently as gains or losses, with a comparable adjustment made between unrestricted and restricted cash. 
    
  Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
    
  API enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its trade receivables and accounts payable denominated in certain foreign currencies. In addition, API enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of its future sales denominated in Euros and the value of its future purchases denominated in USD. These hedges have settlement dates ranging through September 2017. 
    
  The forward contracts that are used to hedge the risk of foreign exchange movement on its trade receivables and accounts payable are accounted for as fair value hedges. At   September 30, 2016  , there were contracts in place to buy Sterling and sell Euros in the amount of    8,743  . The fair values of these derivatives are recognized as derivative assets and liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net change in fair value of the derivative assets and liabilities are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  The forward contracts that are used to hedge the value of API's future sales and purchases are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At   September 30, 2016  , there were contracts in place to hedge the value of future sales denominated in Euros in the amount of    18,525   and the value of future purchases denominated in USD in the amount of   $1,200  . These hedges are fully effective, and,  
  
   24 

accordingly the changes in fair value are recorded in AOCI and, at maturity, any gain or loss on the forward contract is reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
    
  WebBank - Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  WebBank's derivative financial instruments represent on-going economic interests in loans made after they are sold. These derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in Other non-current assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2016 and are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy (see Note 14 - "Fair Value Measurements"). At   September 30, 2016  , derivatives outstanding mature within   3   to   5   years. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments are accounted for in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in Financial Services revenue. Fair value represents the estimated amounts that WebBank would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on a discounted cash flow model for the same or similar instruments. WebBank does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. 
    
  Precious Metal and Commodity Inventories 
    
  HNH's precious metal and commodity inventories are subject to market price fluctuations. HNH enters into commodity futures and forward contracts to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations on its precious and certain non-precious metal inventories that are not subject to fixed-price contracts. HNH's hedging strategy is designed to protect it against normal volatility; therefore, abnormal price changes in these commodities or markets could negatively impact HNH's earnings. The Company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , HNH had the following outstanding forward contracts with settlement dates through October 2016. HNH accounts for these contracts as either fair value hedges or economic hedges. There were no futures contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 

Fair Value Hedges.   Of the total forward contracts outstanding,   557,684   ounces of silver and substantially all of the copper contracts are designated and accounted for as fair value hedges. The fair values of these derivatives are recognized as derivative assets and liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net change in fair value of the derivative assets and liabilities, and the change in the fair value of the underlying hedged inventory, are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations, and such amounts principally offset each other due to the effectiveness of the hedges. The fair value hedges are associated primarily with HNH's precious metal inventory carried at fair value. 
    
  Economic Hedges.   The remaining outstanding forward contracts for silver, and all the contracts for gold and tin, are accounted for as economic hedges. As these derivatives are not designated as accounting hedges, they are accounted for as derivatives with no hedge designation. The derivatives are marked to market, and both realized and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in current period earnings in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. The economic hedges are associated primarily with HNH's precious metal inventory valued using the LIFO method. 
    
  The forward contracts were made with a counter party rated A+ by Standard   Poors. Accordingly, HNH has determined that there is minimal credit risk of default. HNH estimates the fair value of its derivative contracts through the use of market quotes or broker valuations when market information is not available. HNH maintains collateral on account with the third-party broker. Such collateral consists of both cash that varies in amount depending on the value of open contracts, as well as ounces of precious metal held on account by the broker. 
    
  Debt Agreements 
    
  As discussed in Note 8 - "Long-Term Debt," HNH entered into two interest rate swap agreements to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These derivatives were not designated as accounting hedges under U.S. GAAP; they were accounted for as derivatives with no hedge designation. HNH recorded the gains or losses both from the mark-to-market adjustments and net settlements in interest expense in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations as the hedges were intended to offset interest rate movements. The agreements expired in February 2016. 
  
   25 

The fair value and carrying amount of derivative instruments in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and the effect of derivative instruments on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations is shown in the following tables: 

(a) Designated as hedging instruments as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  (b) Fair value hedge 
  (c) Economic hedge 
  (d) Cash flow hedge 
    
  Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
    
  WebBank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. In the normal course of business, these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans as part of WebBank's lending arrangements. Those instruments involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet. The contract amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement WebBank has in particular classes of financial instruments. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , WebBank's undisbursed loan commitments totaled   $164,973   and   $80,667  , respectively. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a borrower who meets the lending criteria through one of WebBank's lending agreements, provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract with the counterparty to the lending arrangement. 
    
  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since certain of the commitments are expected to expire without the credit being extended, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. WebBank evaluates each prospective borrower's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by WebBank upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower and WebBank's counterparty. 
    
  WebBank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. WebBank uses the same credit policy in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. 
    
  WebBank estimates an allowance for potential losses on off-balance sheet contingent credit exposures related to the guaranteed amount of its Small Business Administration ("SBA") and United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") loans and whether or not the SBA/USDA honors the guarantee. WebBank determines the allowance for these contingent credit exposures based on historical experience and portfolio analysis. The allowance is included with Other non-current liabilities in the Company's  
  
   26 

Consolidated Balance Sheets, with any related increases or decreases in the reserve included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allowance was   $188   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

10. PENSION BENEFIT PLANS 
    
  The following table presents the components of pension expense for HNH's pension plans, including the JPS pension plan which was assumed in HNH's acquisition of JPS, and the pension plans of API: 

Beginning January 1, 2016, HNH changed the manner in which the interest cost component of net periodic pension expense is determined. Historically, HNH estimated the interest cost component using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. HNH has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of this component of benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation that correlate to the relevant projected cash flows ("spot rate approach"). This change provides a more precise measurement of interest cost. The estimated impact of this change is to reduce forecast annual pension expense in 2016 by approximately   $4,800  . 
    
  Required future pension contributions are determined based upon assumptions such as discount rates on future obligations, assumed rates of return on plan assets and legislative changes. Actual future pension costs and required funding obligations will be affected by changes in the factors and assumptions described in the previous sentence, as well as other changes such as any plan termination or other acceleration events. Required minimum pension contributions are as follows: 

11. CAPITAL AND ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   26,152,976   Class A units (regular common units) outstanding. 
    
  Common Unit Repurchase Program 
    
  On May 13, 2016, the Board of Directors of SPH GP approved the repurchase of up to an aggregate of   $5,000   of the Company's common units ("May 2016 Repurchase Program"). The May 2016 Repurchase Program was fully utilized in May 2016 when the Company purchased   346,163   units for an aggregate price of approximately   $5,000  . On June 9, 2016, the Board of Directors of SPH GP approved an additional repurchase of up to an aggregate of   $15,000   of the Company's common units ("June 2016 Repurchase Program"). In June 2016, the Company purchased   157,300   units for an aggregate price of approximately   $2,200  . Any purchases made under the June 2016 Repurchase Program will be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The June 2016 Repurchase Program has no termination date. 
    
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
    
  Changes, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows: 
  
   27 

(a) 
    Net of a tax provision of approximately   $640  . 
              (b) 
    Net of a tax provision of approximately   $199  . 
              (c) 
    Amounts do not include the net unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities of   $1,962  , the unrealized loss on derivative financial instruments of   $184  , cumulative translation adjustment losses of   $592   and losses from the change in pension and other post-retirement obligations of   $14  , which are attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
       
  Incentive Unit Expense 
    
  Effective January 1, 2012, SPLP issued to the Manager partnership profits interests in the form of incentive units, a portion of which will be classified as Class C common units of SPLP upon the attainment of certain specified performance goals by SPLP, which are determined as of the last day of each fiscal year. If the performance goals are not met for a fiscal year, no portion of the incentive units will be classified as Class C common units for that year. The number of outstanding incentive units is equal to   100%   of the common units outstanding, including common units held by non-wholly-owned subsidiaries. The performance goals and expense related to the classification of a portion of the incentive units as Class C units is measured on an annual basis, but is accrued on a quarterly basis. Accordingly, the amount accrued is adjusted to reflect the fair value of the Class C common units on each interim calculation date. The expense is recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. There was   no   incentive unit expense recorded in the three or   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company recorded a reduction to incentive unit expense of approximately   $1,040   in the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   no   incentive unit expense was recorded in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 

12. INCOME TAXES 
    
  The Company recorded tax provisions of   $8,334   and   $13,125   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $18,357   and   $24,705   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company's tax provision represents the income tax expense or benefit of its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company's consolidated subsidiaries have recorded deferred tax valuation allowances to the extent that they believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. 
    
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, WFHC and CoSine entered into a series of transactions whereby CoSine was merged with and into WFH LLC, a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of WFHC, which is disregarded for income tax purposes. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a tax benefit in continuing operations of approximately   $111,881   associated with the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances attributable to federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately   $329,600   associated with WFHC, WebBank and the newly merged CoSine business ("WFHC U.S. Consolidated Group") given the resulting change in its judgment about the realizability of the associated deferred tax assets. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company revised its calculation of the expected benefit to be derived from the realizability of federal deferred tax assets of the WFHC U.S. Consolidated Group and recorded an additional tax benefit in continuing operations of approximately   $4,182  . 
    
  In the first quarter of 2015, Steel Excel identified an error related to the manner in which the provision for income taxes had reflected the tax effects related to unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities during 2014 and 2013. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment to its tax provision of approximately   $3,500   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 

13. NET INCOME PER COMMON UNIT 
    
  The following data was used in computing net income per common unit shown in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations: 

14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized by type of inputs applicable to the fair value measurements as follows: 
  
   28 

(a) 
    For additional detail of the marketable securities and long-term investments see Note 7 - "Investments." 
       
  There were no transfers of securities among the various measurement input levels during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows: 
    
  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The valuation under this approach does not entail a significant degree of judgment ("Level 1"). 
    
  Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g. interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals or current market) and contractual prices for the underlying financial instrument, as well as other relevant economic measures ("Level 2"). 
    
  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date ("Level 3"). 
    
  The fair value of the Company's financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and accounts payable, approximate carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. Carrying cost approximates fair value for long-term debt which has variable interest rates. 

29 

The precious metal and commodity inventories associated with HNH's fair value hedges (see Note 9 - "Financial Instruments") are reported at fair value. Fair values of these inventories are based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges and are considered Level 1 measurements. The derivative instruments that HNH purchases in connection with its precious metal and commodity inventories, specifically commodity futures and forwards contracts, are also valued at fair value. The futures contracts are Level 1 measurements since they are traded on a commodity exchange. The forward contracts are entered into with a counterparty and are considered Level 2 measurements. 
    
  The interest rate swap agreements were considered Level 2 measurements as the inputs were observable at commonly quoted intervals. These agreements expired in February 2016. 

Following is a summary of changes in financial assets measured using Level 3 inputs: 

(a) 
    Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Income (loss) of associated companies, net of taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
              (b) 
    Unrealized gains and losses were recorded in Income from other investments - related party in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
              (c) 
    Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Income (loss) from investments held at fair value in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
              (d) 
    Realized gains and losses on sale are recorded in Other income, net or Revenue in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
       
  Long-Term Investments - Valuation Techniques 

30 

The Company estimates the value of one of its investments in an associated company primarily using a discounted cash flow method adjusted for additional information related to debt covenants, solvency issues and other related matters. The ModusLink Warrants are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model (for additional information see Note 7 - "Investments"). 
    
  Marketable Securities and Other - Valuation Techniques 
    
  The Company uses the net asset value included in quarterly statements it receives in arrears from a venture capital fund to determine the fair value of such fund and determines the fair value of certain corporate securities and corporate obligations by incorporating and reviewing prices provided by third-party pricing services based on the specific features of the underlying securities. The fair value of the derivative held by WebBank (see Note 9 - "Financial Instruments") represents the estimated amounts that WebBank would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date and is based on discounted cash flows analyses that consider credit, performance and prepayment. 

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, WebBank has impaired loans with a fair value of   $3,997   and   $423   that are collateral-dependent, and that were measured at fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs using Level 3 inputs. 

15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  As discussed in more detail below, certain of the Company's subsidiaries have been designated as potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") by federal and state agencies with respect to certain sites with which they may have had direct or indirect involvement. These claims are in various stages of administrative or judicial proceedings and include demands for recovery of past governmental costs and for future investigations and remedial actions. In many cases, the dollar amounts of the claims have not been specified and, with respect to a number of the PRP claims, have been asserted against a number of other entities for the same cost recovery or other relief as was asserted against certain of the Company's subsidiaries. The Company accrues costs associated with environmental matters, on an undiscounted basis, when they become probable and reasonably estimable. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , on a consolidated basis, the Company has recorded current liabilities of approximately   $5,500   and non-current liabilities of   $2,622  , which represent its current estimate of the probable cleanup liabilities, including remediation and legal costs. Expenses relating to these costs, and any recoveries, are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, the Company has insurance coverage available for several of these matters and believes that excess insurance coverage may be available as well. Estimates of the Company's liabilities for remediation of a particular site and the method and ultimate cost of remediation require a number of assumptions that are inherently difficult to make, and the ultimate outcome may be materially different from current estimates. 
    
  Certain HNH subsidiaries, including its newly acquired subsidiary SLI, have existing and contingent liabilities relating to environmental matters, including capital expenditures, costs of remediation, and potential fines and penalties relating to possible violations of national and state environmental laws. Those subsidiaries have remediation expenses on an ongoing basis, although such costs are continually being readjusted based upon the emergence of new techniques and alternative methods. HNH recorded current liabilities of approximately   $5,500   and non-current liabilities of approximately   $1,200   related to estimated environmental remediation costs as of   September 30, 2016  . HNH also has insurance coverage available for several of these matters and believes that excess insurance coverage may be available as well. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, HNH recorded insurance reimbursements totaling   $2,800   for previously incurred remediation costs. No similar reimbursements were recorded during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Included among these liabilities, certain HNH subsidiaries have been identified as PRPs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") or similar state statutes at sites and are parties to administrative consent orders in connection with certain properties. Those subsidiaries may be subject to joint and several liabilities imposed by CERCLA on PRPs. Due to the technical and regulatory complexity of remedial activities and the difficulties attendant in identifying PRPs and allocating or determining liability among them, the subsidiaries are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of compliance with such laws. Similarly, BNS LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the BNS Liquidating Trust, has been named as a PRP at one previously disclosed site and a then-subsidiary of BNS ("BNS Sub") has been identified as a PRP at another previously disclosed site. Based upon information currently available, BNS Liquidating Trust and BNS Sub do not expect that their respective environmental costs or that the resolution of these environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company, but there can be no such assurances to this effect. 
    
  Based upon information currently available, the HNH subsidiaries do not expect that their respective environmental costs, including the incurrence of additional fines and penalties, if any, will have a material adverse effect on them or that the resolution of these environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of such subsidiaries or HNH, but there can be no such assurances. HNH anticipates that the subsidiaries will pay any such amounts out of their respective working capital, although there is no assurance that they will have sufficient funds to pay them. In the event that the HNH subsidiaries are unable to fund their liabilities, claims could be made against their respective parent companies, including HNH, for payment of such liabilities. 
    
  The sites where certain HNH subsidiaries have environmental liabilities include the following: 
    
  HNH has been working with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection ("CTDEEP") with respect to its obligations under a 1989 consent order that applies to a property in Connecticut that HNH sold in 2003 ("Sold Parcel") and an adjacent parcel ("Adjacent Parcel") that together comprise the site of a former HNH manufacturing facility. The remaining  
  
   31 

remediation, monitoring and regulatory administrative costs for the Sold Parcel are expected to approximate   $100  . With respect to the Adjacent Parcel, an ecological risk assessment has been completed and the results, along with proposed clean up goals, were submitted in the second quarter of 2016 to the CTDEEP for their review and approval. The next phase will be a physical investigation of the upland portion of the parcel. A work plan was submitted in the third quarter of 2016 to the CTDEEP for review and approval. That work is expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2016 and is estimated to cost   $200  . Investigation of the wetlands portion is not expected to start until the later part of 2017, pending regulatory approvals and setting goals for the entire parcel. The total remediation costs for the Adjacent Parcel cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the resolution of this matter will not be material to the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of HNH. 
    
  In 1986, Handy   Harman Electronic Materials Corporation ("HHEM"), a subsidiary of HNH, entered into an administrative consent order ("ACO") with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ("NJDEP") with regard to certain property that it purchased in 1984 in New Jersey. The ACO involves investigation and remediation activities to be performed with regard to soil and groundwater contamination. HHEM is actively remediating the property and continuing to investigate effective methods for achieving compliance with the ACO. HHEM anticipates entering into discussions with the NJDEP to address that agency's potential natural resource damage claims, the ultimate scope and cost of which cannot be estimated at this time. Pursuant to a settlement agreement with the former owner/operator of the site, the responsibility for site investigation and remediation costs, as well as any other costs, as defined in the settlement agreement, related to or arising from environmental contamination on the property (collectively, "Costs") are contractually allocated   75%   to the former owner/operator and   25%   jointly to HHEM and HNH, all after having the first   $1,000   paid by the former owner/operator. As of   September 30, 2016  , total investigation and remediation costs of approximately   $5,600   and   $1,800   have been expended by the former owner/operator and HHEM, respectively, in accordance with the settlement agreement. Additionally, HHEM is currently being reimbursed indirectly through insurance coverage for a portion of the Costs for which HHEM is responsible. HHEM believes that there is additional excess insurance coverage, which it intends to pursue as necessary. HHEM anticipates that there will be additional remediation expenses to be incurred once a final remediation plan is agreed upon. There is no assurance that the former owner/operator or guarantors will continue to timely reimburse HHEM for expenditures and/or will be financially capable of fulfilling their obligations under the settlement agreement and the guaranties. The final Costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, and accordingly, there can be no assurance that the resolution of this matter will not be material to the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of HHEM or HNH. 
    
  HHEM has been complying with a 1987 consent order from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection ("MADEP") to investigate and remediate the soil and groundwater conditions at a commercial/industrial property in Massachusetts. On June 30, 2010, HHEM filed a Response Action Outcome report to close the site since HHEM's licensed site professional concluded that groundwater monitoring demonstrated that the groundwater conditions have stabilized or continue to improve at the site. As a result of meetings and subsequent discussions with the MADEP, HHEM conducted additional work that was completed in the third quarter of 2015. HHEM expects to submit a follow-up response report to the MADEP in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of the follow up response report and subsequent decommissioning, and any additional costs that could result from the final review of the closure report by the MADEP, are not anticipated to be material. 
    
  SLI may incur environmental costs in the future as a result of past activities of its former subsidiary, SurfTech, at sites located in Pennsauken, New Jersey ("Pennsauken Site") and in Camden, New Jersey ("Camden Site"). At the Pennsauken Site, SLI reached an agreement with both the United States Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") related to its liability and entered into a Consent Decree which governs the agreement. SLI agreed to perform remediation, which is substantially complete, and to pay a fixed sum for the EPA's past costs. The fixed sum is to be paid in installments, and the final payment of   $2,100   is due to be made in the second quarter of 2017. In December 2012, SLI received a demand letter from the office of the Deputy Attorney General of New Jersey ("NJDAG"). The demand is for   $1,300   for past and future cleanup costs and   $500   for natural resource damages for a total demand of   $1,800  . SLI has made a counter-offer to the NJDAG in the amount of   $300  , which has been reserved for, and anticipates entering into discussions to address the NJDAG's claims. The final scope and cost of those claims cannot be estimated at this time but is not expected to be outside a range of   $300   to   $1,800  . 
    
  With respect to the Camden Site, SLI has reported soil contamination and a groundwater contamination plume emanating from the site. A Remedial Action Workplan ("RAWP") for soils is being developed and is expected to be submitted to the NJDEP in the first quarter of 2017, by the Licensed Site Remediation Professional ("LSRP") for the site. The RAWP for treatment of unsaturated soils is scheduled to be initiated during the first quarter of 2017 with post-remediation rebound testing and slab removal to be conducted in the fourth quarter of 2017. SLI's environmental consultants also implemented an interim remedial action pilot study to treat on-site contaminated groundwater, which consisted of injecting food-grade product, into the groundwater at the down gradient property boundary to create a "bio-barrier." Post-injection groundwater monitoring to assess the bio-barrier's effectiveness was completed. Consistent decreases in target contaminants concentrations in groundwater were observed. In December 2014, a report was submitted to the NJDEP stating sufficient information was obtained from the pilot study to complete the full scale  
  
   32 

groundwater remedy design. A full scale groundwater bioremediation will be implemented during the fourth quarter of 2017 following the soil remediation mentioned above. A reserve of   $1,400   has been established for anticipated costs at this site, but there can be no assurance that there will not be potential additional costs associated with the site which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the resolution of this matter will not be material to the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of HNH. 
    
  SLI is currently participating in environmental assessment and cleanup at a commercial facility located in Wayne, New Jersey. Contaminated soil and groundwater has undergone remediation with the NJDEP and LSRP oversight, but contaminants of concern ("COCs") in groundwater and surface water, which extend off-site, remain above applicable NJDEP remediation standards. A soil remedial action plan has been developed to remove the new soil source contamination that continues to impact groundwater. SLI's LSRP completed a supplemental groundwater remedial action, pursuant to a RAWP filed with, and permit approved by, the NJDEP, and a report was filed with the NJDEP in March 2015. SLI's consultants have developed cost estimates for supplemental remedial injections, soil excavation, and additional tests and remedial activities. The LSRP has initiated the preparation of a Remedial Investigation Report, which was sent to the NJDEP in May 2016, and has negotiated off-site access to the adjacent property and installed monitoring wells. Results of the initial samples detected COC's above NJDEP standards. There can no assurance that there will not be potential additional costs associated with the site, which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the resolution of this matter will not be material to the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of HNH. 
    
  Litigation Matters 
    
  BNS Litigation Matters 
    
  BNS Sub has been named as a defendant in   1,367   alleged asbestos-related toxic-tort claims as of   September 30, 2016  . The claims were filed over a period beginning in 1994 through   September 30, 2016  . In many cases, these claims involved more than   100   defendants. Of the claims filed,   1,260   were dismissed, settled or granted summary judgment and closed as of   September 30, 2016  . Of the claims settled, the average settlement was less than   $3  . There remained   107   pending asbestos claims as of   September 30, 2016  . There can be no assurance that the number of future claims and the related costs of defense, settlements or judgments will be consistent with the experience to date of existing claims. 
    
  BNS Sub has insurance policies covering asbestos-related claims for years beginning 1974 through 1988 with estimated aggregate coverage limits of   $183,000  , with   $1,543   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   in estimated remaining self-insurance retention (deductible). There is secondary evidence of coverage from 1970 to 1973, although there is no assurance that the insurers will recognize that the coverage was in place. Policies issued for BNS Sub beginning in 1989 contained exclusions related to asbestos. Under certain circumstances, some of the settled claims may be reopened. Also, there may be a significant delay in receipt of notification by BNS Sub of the entry of a dismissal or settlement of a claim or the filing of a new claim. BNS Sub believes it has significant defenses to any liability for toxic-tort claims on the merits. None of these toxic-tort claims has gone to trial and, therefore, there can be no assurance that these defenses will prevail. 
    
  BNS Sub annually receives retroactive billings or credits from its insurance carriers for any increase or decrease in claims accruals as claims are filed, settled or dismissed, or as estimates of the ultimate settlement and defense costs for the then-existing claims are revised. As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , BNS Sub has accrued   $1,422   relating to the open and active claims against BNS Sub. This accrual represents the Company's best estimate of the likely costs to defend against or settle these claims by BNS Sub beyond the amounts accrued by the insurance carriers and previously funded, through the retroactive billings by BNS Sub. 
    
  There can be no assurance that the number of future claims and the related costs of defense, settlements or judgments will be consistent with the experience to date of existing claims, and that BNS Sub will not need to increase significantly its estimated liability for the costs to settle these claims to an amount that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Other Litigation 
    
  In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to other periodic lawsuits, investigations, claims and proceedings, including, but not limited to, contractual disputes, employment, environmental, health and safety matters, as well as claims associated with our historical acquisitions and divestitures. There is insurance coverage available for many of the foregoing actions. Although we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of lawsuits, investigations, claims and proceedings asserted  
  
   33 

against us, we do not believe any currently pending legal proceeding to which we are a party will have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations or liquidity. 

16. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  Management Agreement with SP General Services LLC 
    
  The Manager receives a fee, pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, at an annual rate of   1.5%   of total SPLP Partners' Capital ("Management Fee"), payable on the first day of each quarter and subject to quarterly adjustment.

17. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
    
  SPLP operates through the following segments: Diversified Industrial, Energy, Financial Services, and Corporate and Other, which are managed separately and offer different products and services. For a more complete description of the Company's segments, see "Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview." Corporate assets, revenues and overhead expenses are not allocated to the segments. 
    
  Steel Services provides legal, tax, accounting, treasury, consulting, auditing, administrative, compliance, environmental health and safety, human resources, marketing, investor relations, operating group management and similar services to other affiliated companies. Steel Services charged the Diversified Industrial, Energy and Financial Services segments approximately   $2,900  ,   $2,000   and   $1,175   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $2,689  ,   $2,038   and   $563   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Steel Services charged the Diversified Industrial, Energy and Financial Services segments approximately   $8,813  ,   $6,113   and   $3,525   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $7,443  ,   $6,113   and   $1,688   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Segment information is presented below: 

18. REGULATORY MATTERS 
    
  WebBank 
    
  WebBank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on WebBank's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, WebBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. WebBank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
    
  In July 2013, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks ("Basel III"). Under the final rules, which began for WebBank on January 1, 2015 and are subject to a phase-in period through January 1, 2019, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by WebBank. The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio ("CET1 Ratio") of   4.5%   and a capital conservation buffer of   2.5%   of risk-weighted assets, which when fully phased-in, effectively results in a minimum CET1 Ratio of   7.0%  . Basel III raises the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from   4.0%   to   6.0%   (which, with the capital conservation buffer, effectively results in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of   8.5%   when fully phased-in),  
  
   35 

effectively results in a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of   10.5%   (with the capital conservation buffer fully phased-in), and requires a minimum leverage ratio of   4.0%  . Basel III also makes changes to risk weights for certain assets and off-balance-sheet exposures. WebBank expects that its capital ratios under Basel III will continue to exceed the well capitalized minimum capital requirements, and such amounts are disclosed in the table below: 

SPLP 
    
  The Company historically has conducted its business, and continues to conduct its business and operations, in such a manner so as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("Act"). Under the Act, the Company is required to meet certain qualitative tests related to the Company's assets and/or income, and to refrain from trading for short-term, speculative purposes. The Company has taken actions, including liquidating certain of our assets and acquiring additional interests in existing or new subsidiaries or controlled companies, to comply with these tests, or a relevant exception. Also, since the Company operates as a diversified holding company engaged in a variety of operating businesses, we do not believe we are primarily engaged in an investment company type business, nor do we propose to primarily engage in such a business. If we were deemed to be an investment company under the Act, we may need to further adjust our business strategy and assets, including divesting certain desirable assets immediately to fall outside of the definition or within an exemption, to register as an investment company or to cease operations.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results     of Operations 

As used in this Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us," "our," "SPLP" and the "Company" refer to Steel Partners Holdings L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. 
    
  The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our present business and the results of operations, together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, along with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. All monetary amounts used in this discussion are in thousands. 
    
  OVERVIEW 
    
  SPLP is a diversified global holding company that engages in multiple businesses through consolidated subsidiaries, associated companies and other interests. It owns and operates businesses and has significant interests in companies in various industries, including diversified industrial products, energy, defense, supply chain management and logistics, banking and youth sports. SPLP operates through the following segments: Diversified Industrial, Energy, Financial Services, and Corporate and Other, which are managed separately and offer different products and services. 
    
  The Diversified Industrial segment consists of the operations of Handy   Harman Ltd. ("HNH"), a diversified holding company that owns a variety of manufacturing operations encompassing joining materials, tubing, building materials, performance materials, electrical products and cutting replacement products and services businesses. The Diversified Industrial segment also includes the operations of WebFinancial Holding LLC ("WFH LLC") beginning in the second quarter of 2015, which through its subsidiary API Group plc ("API"), is a manufacturer and distributor of foils, films and laminates used to enhance the visual appeal of products and packaging. 
    
  The Energy segment consists of Steel Excel Inc. ("Steel Excel"), which provides drilling and production services to the oil and gas industry. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary Steel Sports Inc., Steel Excel's sports business is a social impact organization that strives to provide a first-class youth sports experience, emphasizing positive experiences and instilling the core values of discipline, teamwork, safety, respect and integrity. Steel Excel also continues to identify other new business acquisition opportunities. The operations of Steel Sports are not considered material to SPLP and are included in our Energy segment. 
    
  The Financial Services segment consists of WebBank and WF Asset Corp. WebBank originates and funds consumer and small business loans through lending programs with unaffiliated companies ("Marketing Partners"), where the Marketing Partners provide marketing and servicing for the loans and subsequently purchase the loans (or interests in the loans) that are originated by WebBank. WebBank also has private-label financing programs that are branded for a specific retailer, manufacturer, dealer channel, or proprietary network and bank card programs. WebBank participates in syndicated commercial and industrial, as well as asset-based credit facilities and asset-based securitizations through relationships with other financial institutions. WF Asset Corp. owns a portfolio of investments. WebBank's deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to the current limits, and the bank is examined and regulated by the FDIC and the State of Utah Department of Financial Institutions. 
    
  The Corporate and Other segment consists of several consolidated subsidiaries, including Steel Services Ltd. ("Steel Services"), DGT Holdings Corp. ("DGT") and the BNS Holdings Liquidating Trust ("BNS Liquidating Trust"), as well as various investments and cash and cash equivalents.

  (4) Equity method investment. 
    
  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Revenue 
    
  Revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $40,623  , or   14.7%  , as compared to the same period last year. Excluding growth from the acquisitions of SL Industries, Inc. ("SLI") (June 2016) and JPS Industries, Inc. ("JPS") (July 2015) of   17.5%   and other growth due to higher average silver prices in HNH of   1.8%  , revenue decreased by   4.6%   across the Diversified Industrial, Energy and Financial Services segments. 
    
  Revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $103,210  , or   13.9%  , as compared to the same period last year. Excluding growth from the acquisitions of SLI, JPS and API of   22.9%   and lower investment gains of   3.8%  , revenues declined   5.2%  . This revenue decrease of   5.2%   was primarily due to decreases in the Energy and Diversified Industrial segments, partially offset by an increase in the Financial Services segment. 
    
  Cost of Goods Sold 
    
  Cost of goods sold for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $26,492  , or   13.6%  , and increased   $96,312  , or   19.5%  , in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same periods last year, primarily due to an increase in the Diversified Industrial segment, partially offset by a decrease in the Energy segment due to lower revenue. The increase in the Diversified Industrial segment in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the acquisition of SLI. The increase in the Diversified Industrial segment in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to the acquisitions  
  
   39 

of SLI, JPS and API, as well as higher duties paid on certain imports, amortization related to the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventories associated with HNH's SLI acquisition and certain inventory write-downs at HNH due to the planned closure of two facilities. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative 
    
  Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $16,390  , or   28.7%  , when compared to the same period last year, primarily due to HNH's acquisition of SLI and higher personnel costs at WebBank to support the increase in their business. These SG A expense increases were partially offset by a decrease in the Corporate and Other segment due to lower corporate employee costs and professional fees. SG A expenses in the Energy segment were relatively flat for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period last year. 
    
  SG A expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $29,888  , or   17.7%  , when compared to the same period of 2015, primarily due to the acquisitions of SLI, JPS and API and higher personnel costs at WebBank to support the increase in their business. These SG A expense increases were partially offset by a net decrease in the Energy segment due to the receipt of a litigation settlement in 2016, net of higher corporate overhead and legal fees, as well as a decrease in the Corporate and Other segment due to lower corporate employee costs and lower professional fees.  
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $3,025   and   $2,347  , respectively, and was   $7,390   and   $6,520   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The higher interest expense for both three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to higher borrowing levels in 2016, primarily to fund HNH's recent acquisitions. 
    
  All Other Expenses, Net 
    
  All other expenses, net increased   $2,160   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher finance interest expense, higher provisions for loan losses, higher losses from derivatives and lower gains on investment activity by Steel Excel recorded in the 2016 period, partially offset by lower asset impairment charges of approximately $6,144. In the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded impairment charges of $3,057 primarily due to the planned closure of an HNH facility, and for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded impairment charges of $9,202 due to an other-than-temporary decline in fair value of certain marketable securities and the impairment of a building owned by DGT. 
    
  All other expenses, net decreased   $13,242   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower asset impairment charges of approximately $26,012, partially offset by higher finance interest expense, higher provision for loan losses, higher losses from derivatives and lower gains on investment activity by Steel Excel recorded in the 2016 period. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded impairment charges of $11,527 primarily due to the planned closure of two HNH facilities and an other-than-temporary decline in fair value of certain marketable securities. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded impairment charges of $37,540 due to an other-than-temporary decline in fair value of certain marketable securities and the impairment of a building owned by DGT. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  As a limited partnership, we are generally not responsible for federal and state income taxes, and our profits and losses are passed directly to our limited partners for inclusion in their respective income tax returns. Provision has been made for federal, state, local or foreign income taxes on the results of operations generated by our consolidated subsidiaries, and these are reflected within continuing and discontinued operations. The difference between the effective tax rate and statutory federal rate of 35% is principally due to changes in the valuation allowances, various permanent differences included in the provisions of our subsidiaries, and partnership income not subject to taxation. 
    
  Tax provisions of $  8,334   and   $13,125   were recorded for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and tax provisions of   $18,357   and   $24,705   were recorded for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
    
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, WFHC and CoSine entered into a series of transactions whereby CoSine was merged with and into WFH LLC, a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of WFHC, which is disregarded for income tax purposes. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a tax benefit in continuing operations of approximately   $111,881   associated  
  
   40 

with the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances attributable to federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately   $329,600   associated with WFHC, WebBank and the newly merged CoSine business ("WFHC U.S. Consolidated Group") given the resulting change in its judgment about the realizability of the associated deferred tax assets. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company revised its calculation of the expected benefit to be derived from the realizability of federal deferred tax assets of the WFHC U.S. Consolidated Group and recorded an additional tax benefit in continuing operations of approximately   $4,182  . 
    
  In the first quarter of 2015, Steel Excel identified an error related to the manner in which the provision for income taxes had reflected the tax effects related to unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities during 2014 and 2013. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment to its tax provision of approximately   $3,500   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Income (Loss) of Associated Companies, Net of Taxes 
    
  Income (loss) of associated companies includes income or loss recognized on investments where we own between 20% and 50% of the outstanding equity and have the ability to exercise influence, but not control, over the investee (see Note 7 - "Investments" to the SPLP consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information). The table below details the income or (loss) recorded for our investments in associated companies for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Net (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations 
    
  The net income from discontinued operations in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily represents the gain on sale of HNH's former Arlon, LLC ("Arlon") business. For additional information on the Arlon disposition, see Note 3 - "Discontinued Operations and Asset Impairment Charges" to the SPLP financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following is a summary of SPLP's consolidated operating results, classified by segment: 
  
   41 

Diversified Industrial 
    
  Net sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   $49,692  , or   22.1%  , when compared to the same period in   2015  . The change in net sales reflects approximately $48,300 in incremental sales associated with HNH's SLI acquisition, as well as an increase of $4,600 as a result of higher average silver prices. Excluding the impact of HNH's SLI acquisition and the change in silver prices, HNH's net sales decreased by approximately $3,400 due primarily to lower volume from the joining materials and performance materials businesses, partially offset by growth from the building materials business. The average silver market price was approximately $19.26 per troy ounce during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $14.96 per troy ounce in the same period in 2015. API's net sales were relatively flat for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period last year.  
    
  Segment operating income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   $2,222  , or   21.3%  , when compared to the same period last year, primarily due higher gross profit of   $18,905   and the non-recurrence of   $4,184   in equity method investment losses recorded in 2015, partially offset by higher asset impairment charges in 2016 of $3,557, of which $500 unfavorably impacted gross profit, due to the planned closure of an HNH facility and higher SG A expenses in 2016 of   $16,729  . The higher SG A expenses and higher gross profit were both driven primarily by HNH's SLI acquisition, while gross profit was also favorably impacted by an increase in core growth at HNH of approximately $2,000, driven by higher gross profit from its building materials business resulting from higher sales volume.  
    
  Net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   $166,511  , or   30.0%  , when compared to the same period in 2015. The change in net sales reflects approximately $170,000 in incremental sales associated with the SLI, JPS and API acquisitions, as well as an increase of $2,800 at HNH as a result of higher average silver prices. Excluding the impact of HNH's JPS and SLI acquisitions and the change in silver prices, HNH's net sales decreased by approximately $7,100 due primarily to lower volume from the joining materials business, partially offset by growth from the building materials business. The average silver market price was approximately $17.09 per troy ounce during the first nine months of 2016, as compared to $16.03 per troy ounce in the same period in 2015. Excluding the acquisition impact, API's net sales were relatively flat for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period last year. 
    
  Segment operating income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   $1,653  , or   4.6%  , when compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher gross profit of   $42,184   and higher income of   $7,221   recorded from equity method investments, partially offset by higher asset impairment charges in the 2016 period of $11,457, of which $1,400 unfavorably impacted gross profit, primarily due to the planned closure of two HNH facilities, as well as higher SG A expenses of   $35,488  . The higher gross profit and SG A expenses in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by the SLI, JPS and API acquisitions, however, the higher gross profit was also impacted by an increase in core growth at HNH of approximately $5,300 due to increased gross profit from its building materials business principally due to sales growth. 

Energy 
  
   42 

The continuing weakness in the oil services industry had an adverse effect on the results of operations of the Company's Energy segment in the first   nine   months of 2016. The decline in energy prices, particularly the significant decline in oil prices, has resulted in the Energy segment's customers, the oil and gas exploration and production companies ("E P Companies"), cutting back on their capital expenditures, which has resulted in reduced drilling activity. In addition, the E P Companies have sought price concessions from their service providers to offset their drop in revenue. Such actions on the part of the E P Companies had an adverse effect on the operations of the Energy segment in 2016. Steel Excel has taken certain actions and instituted cost-reduction measures in an effort to mitigate these adverse effects. The Energy segment's results of operations going forward will be dependent on the price of oil, the resulting well production and drilling rig count in the basins in which it operates, and Steel Excel's ability to return to the pricing and service levels of the past as oil prices increase. The drilling rig count in North America has declined significantly since its peak in 2014, which has directly impacted the segment's rig utilization, and the pricing for the segment's services has declined. The North American drilling rig count continued to decline into the second quarter of 2016, but has since been gradually increasing. However, the North American drilling rig count is still substantially lower than in prior years, and as a result, Steel Excel expects the Energy segment to experience a decline in operating income in 2016, as compared to the 2015 results. 
    
  Net revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $6,326  , or   18.9%  , and decreased   $39,107  , or   36.2%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same periods of   2015  . The decreases in net revenue in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 were primarily due to decreases of approximately $4,700 and $37,300, respectively, in Steel Excel's energy business due to the decline in rig utilization and the decline in prices that resulted from the adverse effects the decline in energy prices had on the oil services industry. 
    
  Segment operating loss for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $7,791  , or   69.7%  , when compared to the same period of   2015   primarily due to the non-recurrence of   $7,886   of impairment charges related to marketable securities recorded in the 2015 period and lower losses from equity method investments of   $9,039  . These changes were partially offset by lower gains on sales of investments of   $7,228   and a decrease in gross profit of   $2,078   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period last year. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the decline in revenue in the energy business. 
    
  Segment operating loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $27,782  , or   81.3%  , when compared to the same period of   2015  . Significant changes in the 2016 period were lower impairment charges of   $29,156   related to marketable securities, lower SG A expenses of   $3,067  , due to the receipt of a litigation settlement, net of higher corporate overhead costs, and higher income from equity method investments in the 2016 period of   $11,794  . These changes were partially offset by a decrease in gross profit of   $11,254   and lower gains on sales of investments of   $5,692   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period last year. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the decline in revenue in the energy business. 

Financial Services 
    
  Revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $2,858  , or   15.7%  , and increased   $7,891  , or   17.2%  , in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same periods last year. The decrease in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was the result of lower volume in the existing lending programs for the quarter and the restructuring of program structures. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenue increased due to overall increased volume during the year in WebBank's existing lending programs and the restructuring of program structures, which created a gain on sale. 
    
  Segment operating income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $4,805  , or   37.8%  , and increased   $1,479  , or   4.8%  , in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same periods last year. Both periods were impacted by higher costs and expenses such as higher SG A expenses due to higher personnel expenses in 2016 due to growth in the number of WebBank's programs, expanding WebBank's capabilities, and the need for more oversight to meet regulatory expectations. In addition, finance interest expense and the provision for loan losses both increased in the three and nine and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , when to the same periods last year. The higher finance interest expense was due to a larger deposit balance to support asset growth and an increase in interest rates, and the increase in the provision for loan losses was due to an increase in existing impaired loans and the addition of a loan portfolio of held-to-maturity consumer loans. 

Corporate and Other 
    
  Revenue was relatively flat in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and decreased   $32,085  , or   97.6%  , in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same periods in   2015  . The decrease in the   nine   months ended  
  
   43 

September 30, 2016   was due to net investment gains of $32,267, which were recorded in the 2015 period due to gains on sales of available-for-sale securities of approximately $25,400 and a gain on our investment in CoSine of approximately $6,900 resulting from the re-measurement of our investment upon the acquisition of a majority interest in CoSine in January 2015 (see Note 2 - "Acquisitions" to the SPLP consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-Q). 
    
  Segment operating income increased   $17,862   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , as a result of lower losses in the 2016 period of approximately $15,000 on equity method and other investments and the non-recurrence of an asset impairment charge of $1,315 related to a building owned by DGT that was recorded in the 2015 period. In addition, SG A expenses decreased as a result of lower corporate employee costs and professional fees in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  . 
    
  Segment operating income decreased   $25,159   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , primarily as a result of the non-recurrence of the aforementioned net investment gains of $32,267 recorded in the 2015 period and lower income in the 2016 period of approximately $2,600 from equity method and other investments. These reductions to segment operating income were partially offset by the non-recurrence of the aforementioned DGT building impairment and lower SG A expenses as a result of lower corporate employee costs and lower professional fees during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  . 

DISCUSSION OF CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS 
    
  The following table provides a summary of the Company's consolidated cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015: 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $121,618  . Net income from continuing operations of   $25,272   was impacted by certain non-cash items and a net decrease of   $26,580   relating to changes in certain operating assets and liabilities. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of   $52,275   in loans held for sale due to the timing of loan originations and the level of activity at WebBank. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of   $20,512   in trade and other receivables due to the timing of receipts. 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $109  . Net income from continuing operations of   $13,169   was impacted by certain non-cash items, partially offset by an increase of   $70,876   relating to changes in certain operating assets and liabilities. Of this increase,   $6,863   was from an increase in trade and other receivables,   $52,248   was from an increase in loans held for sale and   $15,029   was from a decrease in accounts payable, accrued and other current liabilities. These changes were partially offset by a   $3,655   decrease in inventories. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by   $2,266   in cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations. 
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $163,210  . Significant items included net cash paid for HNH's acquisition of SLI, including the Electromagnetic Enterprise division of Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation ("EME"), and API's acquisition of Hazen Paper Company ("Hazen"), which totaled an aggregate of   $196,546  , purchases of property, plant and equipment of   $18,733   and an increase in loan originations, net of collections of   $17,866  , partially offset by net proceeds from sales of investments, primarily by Steel Excel, of   $51,372   and proceeds from sale of assets of   $10,129  , primarily as a result of the sale of API's security holographics business. 
    
  Net cash provided by investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $82,016  . Significant items included proceeds received from HNH's sale of Arlon of   $155,517   and net proceeds from sales of investments of   $53,798  , primarily due to CoSine's sale of Nathan's Famous, Inc. shares and net proceeds from investment sales by Steel Excel. In addition, cash  
  
   44 

flows from investing activities were impacted by purchases of property, plant and equipment of   $17,037  , acquisitions of   $117,226  , primarily due to the API and JPS acquisitions, and additional investments in associated companies, primarily MLNK, of   $7,607  . 
    
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $184,954  , including net revolver borrowings of   $167,177  , primarily by HNH to fund the acquisitions of SLI and EME, proceeds from term loans of   $9,839  , primarily to fund API's Hazen acquisition, and a net increase in deposits of   $37,743  . These increases were partially offset by cash used to purchase the Company's common units of   $7,297   and subsidiaries' purchases of their common stock of   $20,956  . 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $19,064  . This was due primarily to net revolver payments of   $41,280  , repayments of term loans of   $10,845  , subsidiary's purchases of the Company's common units of   $8,537  , purchases of SPLP common units of   $1,917   and subsidiary's purchases of their common stock of   $6,105  , partially offset by a net increase in deposits of   $49,257  . 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  SPLP (excluding its operating subsidiaries, "Holding Company") is a global diversified holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries, noncontrolling investments in equity securities, and cash and cash equivalents. SPLP strives to enhance the liquidity and business operations of its companies and increase long-term value for unitholders and stakeholders through balance sheet improvements, strategic allocation of capital and operational and growth initiatives. The Company uses a set of tools and processes called the   Steel Business System   to drive operational and sales efficiencies across each of its business units. The   Steel Business System   is designed to drive strategy deployment and sales and marketing based on lean principles. SPLP's operational initiatives include creating efficiencies through consolidated purchasing and materials sourcing provided by the   Steel Partners Purchasing Council  , which arranges shared purchasing programs and is reducing costs for, and providing other benefits to, a number of SPLP's companies. The Company strives to reduce our companies' operational costs, and enhance growth and profitability, through the implementation of   Steel Partners Operational Excellence Programs  , which include the deployment of Lean Manufacturing, Design for Six Sigma, Six Sigma and Strategy Deployment. SPLP is focused on reducing corporate overhead of our companies by centralizing certain administrative and corporate services through Steel Partners Corporate Services that provides management, consulting and advisory services. 
    
  The Holding Company's principal sources of funds, a portion of which are used to pay its overhead expenses, are available cash resources, servicing contracts with subsidiaries and affiliates, borrowings, investments, public and private capital market transactions, distributions or dividends from subsidiaries and/or investments, as well as dispositions of existing businesses. Investments, which are generally recorded at fair value, are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents, but they are generally convertible into cash within a reasonable period of time. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Holding Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $5,200 and investments of approximately $92,000, of which approximately $86,700 is either pledged as collateral under the credit facility with PNC Bank, National Association ("PNC Credit Facility") or restricted. The PNC Credit Facility provides for a revolving credit facility with borrowing availability of up to   $105,000  . The Holding Company's availability under the PNC Credit Facility was approximately   $18,000   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Holding Company generally does not have access to the cash flow generated by the Company's operating businesses for its needs, and the operating businesses generally do not rely on the Holding Company to support their operating activities. The Holding Company and its operating businesses believe that they have access to adequate resources to meet their needs for normal operating costs, capital expenditures, pension payments, debt obligations, working capital for their existing business and acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. These resources include cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash provided by operating activities and unused lines of credit. The Holding Company and its operating businesses' ability to satisfy their debt service obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures and required pension payments, and to make acquisitions will depend upon their future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the markets in which they operate, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond their control. There can be no assurances that the Holding Company and its operating businesses will continue to have access to their lines of credit if their financial performance does not satisfy the financial covenants set forth in their respective financing agreements, which could also result in the acceleration of their debt obligations by their respective lenders, adversely affecting liquidity. 
    
  Below are liquidity discussions for each of our operating businesses: 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , HNH's working capital was   $157,358  , as compared to working capital of   $119,246   as of   December 31, 2015  . HNH's principal source of liquidity is its cash flows from operations. HNH's ongoing operating cash flow

requirements consist primarily of arranging for the funding of the minimum requirements of the WHX Corporation Pension Plan and paying HNH's administrative costs. HNH expects to have required minimum contributions to the WHX Corporation Pension Plan of $3,400 for the remainder of 2016, and $27,500, $32,900, $33,200, $32,000 and $82,900 in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and for the five years thereafter, respectively. For JPS' pension plan, HNH expects to have required minimum contributions of $500 for the remainder of 2016, and $7,300, $8,700, $5,700, $3,400, and $13,400 in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and for the five years thereafter, respectively. Required future pension contributions are estimated based upon assumptions such as discount rates on future obligations, assumed rates of return on plan assets and legislative changes. Actual future pension costs and required funding obligations will be affected by changes in the factors and assumptions described above, as well as other changes such as any plan termination or other acceleration events.

As of September 30, 2016, no leases had been entered into under the master lease agreement.

  This report includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), including,  
  
   46 

in particular, forward-looking statements under the headings "Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." These statements appear in a number of places in this report and include statements regarding the Company's intent, belief or current expectations with respect to (i) its financing plans, (ii) trends affecting its financial condition or results of operations, and (iii) the impact of competition. The words "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements; however, this report also contains other forward-looking statements in addition to historical information. 

Item 4  .   Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, the Company conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that all information required to be disclosed in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Company management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries completed the acquisitions of CoSine, API, JPS, SLI and EME on January 20, 2015, April 17, 2015, July 2, 2015, June 1, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively. The Company's management excluded the operations of CoSine, API and JPS from its evaluation of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of managements internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 and will exclude the operations of SLI, including EME, from its evaluation of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of managements internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. These businesses represent approximately 18.7% of the Company's total assets as of   September 30, 2016   and approximately 24.4% of the Company's revenue for the   nine   months then ended. The Company's management will fully integrate the operations of CoSine, API and JPS into its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting in 2016, and SLI, including EME, will be integrated into such assessment in 2017. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  No change in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting, except for the changes in internal control over financial reporting associated with HNH integrating its acquisition of SLI, which was completed on June 1, 2016.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. For further information regarding our legal proceedings, see our legal proceedings set forth in Note 15 - "Commitments and Contingencies," to the SPLP consolidated financial statements included in Part I of this Report. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  In addition to the information set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" above and under "Risk Factors" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the risk factor set forth below. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These enumerated risks are not the only risks we face. Our operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or by factors that we currently consider immaterial to our business. 
    
  Transfer restrictions contained in the Company's Protective Amendment to the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership and other factors could hinder the development of an active market for our common units. 
    
  There can be no assurance as to the volume of our common units or the degree of price volatility for our common units traded on the New York Stock Exchange. There are transfer restrictions contained in the Protective Amendment to the Company's Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership ("Limited Partnership Agreement") to help protect net operating tax loss carryforwards of certain of the Company's corporate subsidiaries and other portfolio companies. The transfer restrictions will expire three years after the execution of the Limited Partnership Agreement, and they could hinder development of an active market for our common units. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  (a) Not applicable 
    
  (b) Not applicable 
    
  (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
    
  On May 13, 2016, the Board of Directors of the general partner of the Company approved the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $5,000 of the Company's common units. Having been fully utilized in May 2016, on June 9, 2016, the Board of Directors of the general partner of the Company approved the additional repurchase of up to an aggregate of $15,000 of the Company's common units ("June 2016 Repurchase Program").
