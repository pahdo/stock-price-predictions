1.  Nature of Operations and Financial Statement Presentation 
  Nature of Operations 
  Agilysys is a leading technology company that provides innovative software for point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, workforce management, analytics, document management and mobile and wireless solutions and services to the hospitality industry. Our solutions and services allow property managers to better connect, interact and transact with their customers and enhance their customer relationships by streamlining operations, improving efficiency, increasing guest recruitment and wallet share, and enhancing the overall guest experience. We serve four major market sectors: Gaming, both corporate and tribal; Hotels, Resorts and Cruise; Foodservice Management; and Restaurants, Universities, Stadia and Healthcare. A significant portion of our consolidated revenue is derived from contract support, maintenance and subscription services.           
  We operate throughout North America, Europe and Asia, with corporate services located in Alpharetta, GA.   
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2017 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. 
    
  Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. 
    
  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  , as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow for the   three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made.  
    
  These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   March 31, 2016  , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 10, 2016. 
    
  Correction of Errors 
    
  In connection with the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we identified errors in the manner in which we recognized revenue on contract support.  Contract support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer arrangement.  In certain instances where contract support is an element of a multiple-element arrangement, we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value allocation for recognition of revenue on each deliverable.  An error related to an input used in this allocation resulted in the overstatement of contract, maintenance, and support revenue of $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  The error was identified and corrected during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.  Additionally, during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we identified  
  
   7 

errors in the manner in which we capitalize internal labor on software development projects.   An error in the method by which internal resources account for administrative time resulted in the over capitalization of costs during the last six months of fiscal 2015 and the first three months of fiscal 2016.  The error for each of the three months ended December 31, 2014, March 31, 2015, and June 30, 2015, was $0.1 million.  We corrected these errors during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
    
  In accordance with accounting guidance found in ASC 250-10 (SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materiality), we assessed the materiality of the errors and concluded that the errors were not material to any of our previously issued financial statements.  Correction of the errors is also not material to the three and six months ended September 30, 2015 or fiscal 2016 results. 

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended   March 31, 2016  , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed therein. 
    
  Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." ASU 2016-15 clarifies the classification of receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 provides guidance related to (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) settlement and payment of zero coupon debt instruments, (3) contingent consideration, (4) proceeds from settlement of insurance claims, (5) proceeds from settlement of corporate and bank owned life insurance policies, (6) distributions from equity method investees, (7) cash receipts from beneficial interests obtained by a transferor, and (8) general guidelines for cash receipts and payments that have more than one aspect of classification. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact the adopting this guidance will have on future financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in this update involve several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The amendments in this update clarify the implementation guidance on principals versus agent considerations in FASB ASC 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09 described below. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.  The amendments in this update include a new FASB ASC Topic 842, which supersedes Topic 840. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of interim or annual reporting periods. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which converges the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board standard on revenue recognition. Areas of revenue recognition that will be affected include, but are not limited to, transfer of control, variable consideration, allocation of transfer pricing, licenses, time value of money, contract costs and disclosures. In August 2015, the FASB amended the effective date and early adoption is permitted only for fiscal years beginning after December 15,  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

2016. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. 
    
  The FASB has also issued the following standards which provide additional clarification and implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU 2014-09 and have the same effective date as the original standard: ASU 2016-12 and ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (Topic 606).  We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the related ASU 2014-09 standards will have on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. 
    
  Management continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements. 

3.  Restructuring Charges 
  We recognize restructuring charges when a plan that materially changes the scope of our business or the manner in which that business is conducted is adopted and communicated to the impacted parties, and the expenses have been incurred or are reasonably estimable.  
    
  Fiscal 2016 Restructuring Activity 
    
  Q4   - In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we continued our efforts to better align product development and general and administrative functions with our company strategy and to reduce operating costs. We recorded $0.3 million in restructuring charges related to the Q4 fiscal 2016 restructuring activity in fiscal 2016, comprised of severance and other employee related benefits. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a remaining liability of approximately   $17,000   recorded for the Q4 fiscal 2016 restructuring activity. We expect to record additional restructuring expense related to the Q4 fiscal 2016 restructuring event during fiscal 2017 as those obligations become present and the definition of a liability included in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, is met. These additional charges are not expected to exceed   $0.2 million  . 
    
  Following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the restructuring liability:

4.  Intangible Assets and Software Development Costs 
    
  The following table summarizes our intangible assets and software development costs: 

During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we announced general availability of our rGuest  Stay property management solution and placed into service   $31.2 million   of related software development costs.  Additionally, during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we announced general availability of our rGuest  Buy point of sale solution and placed into service   $10.4 million   of related software development costs.  Amortization of these internally developed technologies are included in Products cost of goods sold and was   $1.9 million     for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   $2.9 million   for the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  .  The useful life of each asset is 5 years.  
    
  The following table summarizes our remaining estimated amortization expense relating to in service intangible assets and software development costs.   

10 

     Table of Contents  

Intangible assets are comprised of acquired and internally developed technology to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed and other non-software assets including, customer relationships, non-competition agreements, trade names and patented technology.  Amortization expense of acquired and internally developed technology is included in Products cost of goods sold and was   $2.1 million   and   $0.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $3.4 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   six months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Amortization expense of non-software intangibles is included in operating expenses along with acquired and internally developed internal use software.  Internal use software is classified as property and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Amortization expense of non-software intangible and internal use assets was   $11,500     for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $23,000   for the   six months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Capitalized software development costs that are internally developed to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, are carried on our balance sheet at net realizable value, net of accumulated amortization.  We capitalized approximately   $3.4 million   and   $2.6 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $6.7 million   and   $7.1 million   during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

5.  Additional Balance Sheet Information 
  Additional information related to the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows: 

Accounts Receivable, net 
    
  Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts was   $16.1 million   and   $22.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , respectively.  The related allowance for doubtful accounts was   $0.5 million   and   $0.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , respectively.   
    
  On January 12, 2015, an involuntary bankruptcy petition was filed against Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. (Caesars) under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On January 15, 2015, Caesars and certain of its affiliates filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under Chapter 11. Those cases have been consolidated in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois. At March 31, 2015, our accounts receivable owing by Caesars and its affiliates who have filed a bankruptcy petition totaled approximately $  3.2   million, including both pre- and post-petition claims.  As of May 26, 2015, we filed a proof of claim with the Bankruptcy Court identifying approximately $  0.7 million   of pre-petition claims.  In January 2016, we filed an amended proof of claim with the Bankruptcy Court identifying approximately $0.2 million of pre-petition claim in addition to those filed on May 26, 2015.  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $0.7 million   of pre-petition claims remain outstanding.  

6.  Income Taxes  
    
  The following table compares our income tax benefit and effective tax rates for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

For the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, foreign and state taxes, and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences.   
  
   12 

For the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, the refunded settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit, foreign and state taxes, and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. 
    
  We have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences.  The amount of valuation allowance, however, could be reduced in the near term. The exact timing will be based on the level of profitability we achieve. We expect a full release of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets in Hong Kong. We expect that the release of the valuation allowance will be recorded as an income tax benefit at the time of release increasing our reported net income. Our recorded tax rate may increase in subsequent periods following a valuation allowance release. Any valuation allowance release will not affect the amount of cash paid for income taxes. 

7.  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.           
  On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The complaint alleges, among other things, that point-of-sale and property management and other hospitality information technology products, software, components and/or systems sold by us infringe three patents owned by Ameranth purporting to cover generation and synchronization of menus, including restaurant menus, event tickets, and other products across fixed, wireless and/or internet platforms as well as synchronization of hospitality information and hospitality software applications across fixed, wireless and internet platforms. The complaint seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit, or any possible monetary exposure associated with the lawsuit.  However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter.

8.  (Loss) Earnings per Share 
    
  The following data shows the amounts used in computing (loss) earnings per share and the effect on income and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. 

Basic (loss) earnings per share is computed as net (loss) income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes   541,473   and   450,618   of restricted shares at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and, therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic (loss) earnings per share at the balance sheet dates.   
    
  Diluted (loss) earnings per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share.  We have stock options, stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs) and unvested restricted shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted (loss) earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, for the three months and six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , basic weighted-average shares outstanding were used in calculating the diluted net loss per share. 

9.  Share-based Compensation 
    
  We may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and restricted share units for up t  o   2.0 million   common shares under our shareholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan), plus   957,575  , the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan) as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2011 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired.  The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted share units that may be granted under the 2016 Plan is   1.25 million  .  With respect to awards that are intended to qualify for the performance-based exception to the deductibility limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the maximum number of shares subject to stock options or SSARs that may be granted to an individual in a calendar year is   800,000   shares, and the maximum number of shares subject to restricted shares or restricted share units that may be granted to an individual in a calendar year is   400,000   shares.  
    
  We have a shareholder-approved 2011 Plan, 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan) and a 2000 Stock Incentive Plan that still have vested awards outstanding. Awards are no longer being granted from these incentive plans. 
    
  We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and appreciation right exercises or restricted share and performance share awards. 

14 

     Table of Contents  

We record compensation expense related to stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and SSARs awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares.  
    
  The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for options, SSARs, restricted and performance awards included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:

As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non-vested SSARs was   $1.0 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of   1.58   years. 
    
  Restricted Shares 
    
  We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the six months ended   September 30, 2016   for restricted shares awarded under the 2016 and 2011 Plan: 

The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock was   $3.8 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of   1.53   years.

10.  Fair Value Measurements  
  We estimate the fair value of financial instruments using available market information and generally accepted valuation methodologies. We assess the inputs used to measure fair value using a three-tier hierarchy. The hierarchy indicates the extent to which pricing inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Level 1 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities and are the most observable. Level 2 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities that are either directly or indirectly observable, or other observable inputs such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity rates, and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are not observable in the market and include our own judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable and unobservable inputs is reflected in the hierarchy assessment disclosed in the tables below. 
    
  There were no significant transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 during the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  The following tables present information about our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value:

The recorded value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is adjusted to the cash surrender value of the policies obtained from the third party life insurance providers, which are not observable in the market, and therefore, are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the cash surrender value of these policies are recorded within  Other (income) expense, net  in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined by calculating the probability-weighted earn-out payments based on the assessment of the likelihood that certain milestones would be achieved.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  In  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ( MD A ), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: 
    
       what factors affect our business; 
       what our earnings and costs were; 
       why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; 
       where the earnings came from; 
       how our financial condition was affected; and 
       where the cash will come from to fund future operations. 
    
  The MD A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management     believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   March 31, 2016  , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended   March 31, 2016  . Information provided in the MD A may include     forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could     cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking     statements. See  Forward-Looking Information  on page 30 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A  Risk Factors      in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended   March 31, 2016   for additional information     concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. 
    
  Overview 
    
  Agilysys is a leading technology company that provides innovative software for point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, workforce management, analytics, document management and mobile and wireless solutions and services to the hospitality industry.

A significant portion of our consolidated revenue is derived from contract support, maintenance and subscription services. 
    
  Agilysys operates extensively throughout North America, Europe and Asia, with corporate services located in Alpharetta, GA.  
    
  Our top priority is increasing shareholder value by improving operating and financial performance and profitability growing the business through superior products and services.

The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: 

Net revenue.    Total net revenue increased   $3.0 million  , or   10.2%  , during the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  . Products revenue increased   $0.8 million  , or   7.9%  , due to increased remarketed product sales related to iconic products, as well as increased new logo hardware sales associated with our proprietary software sold as a service.  Remarketed product revenue growth was offset slightly by a decline in proprietary software license revenue in line with the strategic shift in mix to subscription based services revenue.  Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased   $1.2 million  , or   8.5%  , compared to the   second   quarter of fiscal 2016 driven primarily by continued increases in subscription based service revenue, which increased approximately   46.3%   during the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the   second   quarter of fiscal 2016.  Professional services revenue increased   $1.0 million  , or   19.9%  , as a result of increased volume of customer installation and implementation projects associated with growth in overall product revenue.  
    
  Gross profit and gross profit margin.    Our total gross profit decreased   $1.7 million  , or   9.7%  , for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   and total gross profit margin decreased approximately   1,075   basis points to   48.6%  .  Products gross profit decreased   $2.2 million   and gross profit margin decreased approximately   2,450   basis points to   24.0%   primarily as a result of an increase of   $1.9 million   of developed technology amortization as a result of the rGuest  Stay and Buy development costs being placed into service with the announcement of the property management system and point of sale solution as being generally available during the first and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit remained consistent and gross margin decreased   140   basis points to   72.4%   as we continue to invest in our subscription platform.  Professional services gross profit decreased   $0.2 million   and gross profit margin declined approximately   900   basis points to   29.7%   primarily as a result of up front investment in our professional services team to support the growth in both proprietary software license and subscription services revenues during the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   as compared to the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  .

Operating expenses 
    
  Operating expenses, excluding the charges for asset write-offs and other fair value adjustments, legal settlements, and restructuring, severance and other charges, remained consistent during the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  . 
     
  Product development.    Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development increased   $0.2 million  , or   2.4%   in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  .  This increase is primarily driven by our continued investment in resources related to both our rGuest  and iconic product enhancements to expand the customer experience across our install base as well as our future offerings with existing and new customers.  In addition, certain research and development costs are capitalized as software development costs upon achieving specific milestones in the development life-cycle.  We capitalized approximately   $3.6 million   and   $2.8 million   as software development costs for future use during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Sales and marketing.    Sales and marketing decreased   $0.2 million  , or   3.8%  , in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  .  The change is primarily the result of a decrease of   $0.4 million   in employee related expense due to the timing of a large, subscription based booking during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  This was offset by increased spend in advertising and promotion of   $0.2 million   related to new lead generation investment in content, search engine marketing, and target prospect databases in order to accelerate the growth in lead acquisition and pipeline velocity in support of future revenue growth. 
    
  General and administrative.    General and administrative declined   $0.1 million  , or   1.2%  , in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   due primarily of our continued efforts to improve efficiencies and streamline back office functions. 
    
  Other Expenses (Income) 

Interest income.    Interest income consists of interest earned on investments in certificates of deposit, commercial paper and corporate bonds.  
    
  Interest expense.   Interest expense consists of costs associated with capital leases and loans on corporate-owned life insurance policies. Interest expense remained flat in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  .   
    
  Other (income) expense.    Other (income) expense consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar.

Income Taxes 

nm - not meaningful 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, foreign and state taxes, and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences.   
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, the refunded settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit, foreign and state taxes, and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. 
    
  Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur in the range of zero to $0.1 million of tax and zero to $0.1 million of interest based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. 
    
  We have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of valuation allowance, however, could be reduced in the near term. The exact timing will be based on the level of profitability we achieve. We expect a full release of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets in Hong Kong. We expect that the release of the valuation allowance will be recorded as an income tax benefit at the time of release increasing our reported net income. Our recorded tax rate may increase in subsequent periods following a valuation allowance release. Any valuation allowance release will not affect the amount of cash paid for income taxes.

The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: 

Net revenue.    Total net revenue increased   $6.5 million  , or   11.4%  , during the   first half   of fiscal   2017   compared to the   first half   of fiscal   2016  . Products revenue increased   $1.5 million  , or   8.0%  , due to increased remarketed product sales for iconic products, as well as increased new logo hardware sales associated with our proprietary software sold as a service.  Remarketed product revenue growth was offset slightly by a decline in proprietary software license revenue in line with the strategic shift in mix to subscription based services revenue.  Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased   $1.3 million  , or   4.4%  , compared to the   first half   of fiscal 2016 driven primarily by continued increases in subscription based service revenue, which increased approximately   39.3%   during the   first half   of fiscal 2017 compared to the   first half   of fiscal 2016.  Professional services revenue increased   $3.7 million  , or   42.0%  , as a result of increased volume of customer installation and implementation projects associated with growth in overall product revenue.  
    
  Gross profit and gross profit margin.    Our total gross profit decreased   $1.9 million  , or   5.6%  , for the   first half   of fiscal   2017   and total gross profit margin decreased approximately   910   basis points to   50.4%  .  Products gross profit decreased   $3.1 million   and gross profit margin decreased approximately   1,890   basis points to   27.5%   primarily as a result of an increase of   $2.9 million   of developed technology amortization as a result of the rGuest  Stay and Buy development costs being placed into service with the announcement of the property management system and point of sale solution as being generally available during the first and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit remained consistent and gross margin decreased   190   basis points to   73.3%   as we continue to invest in our subscription platform.  Professional services gross profit increased   $0.9 million   and gross profit margin declined approximately   340   basis points to   31.2%   primarily as a result of up front investment in our professional services team to support the growth in both proprietary software license and subscription services revenues during the   first half   of fiscal   2017   as compared to the   first half   of fiscal   2016  .

Operating expenses 
    
  Operating expenses, excluding the charges for asset write-offs and other fair value adjustments, legal settlements, and restructuring, severance and other charges, remained consistent during the   first half   of fiscal   2017   compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016  . 
     
  Product development.    Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development increased   $0.7 million  , or   5.7%   in the   first half   of fiscal   2017   compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016  .  This increase is primarily driven by our continued investment in resources related to both our rGuest  and iconic product enhancements to expand the customer experience across our install base as well as our future offerings with existing and new customers.  In addition, certain research and development costs are capitalized as software development costs upon achieving specific milestones in the development life-cycle.  We capitalized approximately   $7.0 million   and   $7.6 million   as software development costs for future use during the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Sales and marketing.    Sales and marketing increased   $1.0 million  , or   10.0%  , in the   first half   of fiscal   2017   compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016  .  The change is due primarily to an increase of approximately   $0.5 million   in employee related expense in line with booking growth, specifically in subscription based bookings, whose total contract value increased 135% year over year. In addition, advertising and promotion increased   $0.6 million   related to new lead generation investment in content, search engine marketing, and target prospect databases in order to accelerate the growth in lead acquisition and pipeline velocity in support of future revenue growth.   
    
  General and administrative.    General and administrative declined   $0.4 million  , or   3.5%  , in the   first half   of fiscal   2017   compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016   due primarily of our continued efforts to improve efficiencies and streamline back office functions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Overview 
    
  Our operating cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and payments of principal and interest on indebtedness outstanding, which primarily consists of lease and rental obligations at   September 30, 2016  . We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of   $51.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements in the next 12 months.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , our total debt was approximately   $0.3 million  , comprised of capital lease obligations in both periods.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , 100% of our cash and cash equivalents were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. We maintain approximately 92% of our cash and cash equivalents in the United States. Therefore, we believe that credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents. 
    
  Cash Flow

     Table of Contents  

Cash flow used in operating activities.    Cash flows used in operating activities was   $0.2 million   in the first six months of fiscal 2017. The use of cash was attributable to   $1.4 million   in net working capital movements associated mainly with   $5.9 million   in increased collections on accounts receivable, offset by a   $6.8 million   decrease in deferred revenue related to revenue recognized for annual support and maintenance services.  This was offset by   $1.2 million   related to our operating loss adjusted for depreciation, amortization, and share based compensation.
