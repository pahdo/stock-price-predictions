2. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation  

The
unaudited financial statements included herein were prepared by the Company, pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting
of normal recurring accruals and adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the operating
results for the respective periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) were
omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and footnotes included in the Company s 2015 audited financial statements included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016.  

Basis
of Consolidation  

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CREG and its subsidiaries, Shanghai Yinghua Financial Leasing Co., Ltd.
( Yinghua ) and Sifang Holdings, its wholly owned subsidiaries, Huahong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. ( Huahong )
and Shanghai TCH, Shanghai TCH s wholly-owned subsidiary, Xi an TCH Energy Tech Co., Ltd. ( Xi an TCH )
and Xi an TCH s subsidiaries, Erdos TCH Energy Saving Development Co., Ltd ( Erdos TCH ), 100% owned by
Xi an TCH (See note 1), Zhonghong, 90% owned by Xi an TCH, and Zhongxun, 100% owned by Xi an TCH.  Substantially
all of the Company s revenues are derived from the operations of Shanghai TCH and its subsidiaries, which represent substantially
all of the Company s consolidated assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. All
significant inter-company accounts and transactions were eliminated in consolidation.   

Use
of Estimates  

In
preparing these consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets as well as revenues and expenses during the period
reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.   

Revenue
Recognition  

Sales-type
Leasing and Related Revenue Recognition   

The
Company constructs and leases waste energy recycling power generating projects to its customers. The Company typically transfers
ownership of the waste energy recycling power generating projects to its customers at the end of the lease. The investment
in these projects is recorded as investment in sales-type leases in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 840 ,  Lease s ,   and its various amendments
and interpretations. The Company finances construction of waste energy recycling power generating projects. The sales and
cost of sales are recognized at the inception of the lease. The investment in sales-type leases consists of the sum of the minimum
lease payments receivable less unearned interest income and estimated executory cost. Minimum lease payments are part of the lease
agreement between the Company (as the lessor) and the customer (as the lessee). The discount rate implicit in the lease is
used to calculate the present value of minimum lease payments. The minimum lease payments consist of the gross lease payments
net of executory costs and contingent rentals, if any. Unearned interest income is amortized to income over the lease term to
produce a constant periodic rate of return on net investment in the lease. While revenue is recognized at the inception of
the lease, the cash flow from the sales-type lease occurs over the course of the lease, which results in interest income and reduction
of receivables. Revenue is recognized net of sales tax.  

Contingent
Rental Income   

The
Company records income from actual electricity usage in addition to minimum lease payments of each project as contingent rental
income in the period contingent rental income is earned.  Contingent rent is not part of minimum lease payments.  

Cash
and Equivalents  

Cash
and equivalents includes cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.  

Accounts
Receivable  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had accounts receivable of $25,062,146 (mainly from sale of CDQ and a CDQ WHPG system to Rongfeng
and sale of CDQ and a CDQ WHPG system to Zhongtai) . As of December 31, 2015, the Company had accounts receivable of $15,399,778
(mainly from sale of CDQ and a CDQ WHPG system to Rongfeng), respectively.   

Property
and Equipment  

Property
and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred;
additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related
cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation
of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated lives as follows:  

Impairment
of Long-lived Assets  

In
accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360,   Property, Plant, and Equipment ,  the Company reviews its long-lived
assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. If the total expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the
carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the asset.
There was no impairment as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   

Notes
Payable   Banker s Acceptances  

The
Company endorses banker s acceptances that are issued from a bank to vendors as payment for its obligations.  Most
of the banker s acceptances have maturity dates of less than six months following their issuance.   

Cost
of Sales  

Cost
of sales consists primarily of the direct material of the power generating system and expenses incurred directly for project construction
for sales-type leasing and sales tax and additions for contingent rental income.  

Noncontrolling
Interests  

The
Company follows FASB ASC Topic 810,   Consolidation,   which established new standards governing the
accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests ( NCIs ) in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and
the loss of control of subsidiaries. Certain provisions of this standard indicate, among other things, that NCIs (previously referred
to as minority interests) be treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability (as was previously the case), that
increases and decreases in the parent s ownership interest that leave control intact be treated as equity transactions rather
than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses, and that losses of a partially-owned consolidated subsidiary be allocated
to NCIs even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance.  

The
net income (loss) attributed to NCIs was separately designated in the accompanying statements of income and comprehensive income
(loss). Losses attributable to NCIs in a subsidiary may exceed an NCI s interests in the subsidiary s equity. The
excess attributable to NCIs is attributed to those interests. NCIs shall continue to be attributed their share of losses even
if that attribution results in a deficit NCI balance.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments  

For
certain of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, other
receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term debts, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due
to their short maturities. Receivables on sales-type leases are based on interest rates implicit in the lease.  

FASB
ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,   requires disclosure of the fair value ( FV )
of financial instruments held by the Company. FASB ASC Topic 825,   Financial Instruments,   defines
FV, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of FV measurement that enhances disclosure requirements
for FV measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities
each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their FV because of the short period of time between the
origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of
valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:  

Level
    1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level
    2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs
    that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
    instrument.   

Level
    3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to FV measurement.   

The
Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480,   Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity,   and ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging.     

The
following are the considerations with respect to disclosures of FV of long-term debt obligations:  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company s long-term debt obligations consisted of the Zhonghong entrusted loan of $49.72 million.
As of December 31, 2015, the Company s long-term debt obligations consisted of the following: (i) various long-term bank
loans and Zhongrong International Trust Co., Ltd. ( ZRIT ) trust loan payable of $18.19 million, and (ii) Zhonghong
entrusted loan of $58.83 million.  

FV
measurements and approximations for certain financial instruments are based on what a reporting entity would likely have to pay
to transfer the financial obligation to an entity with a comparable credit rating. The Company s bank loans and trust loans
payable are privately held (i.e., nonpublic) debt; therefore, pricing inputs are not observable. For this reason, the Company
classified bank loans and trust loans payable as a Level 3 FV measurement in the valuation hierarchy.  

For
the Company s long-term bank loans, ZRIT trust loan and Zhonghong entrusted loans noted above, the Company believes the
carrying amounts approximate their FV. Based on the Company s understanding of the credit markets, the Company s business
is in a sector (energy-saving green) that is supported by the PRC government and the lending bank, the Company believes it could
have obtained similar loans on similar terms and interest rates. In addition, in connection with the FV measurement, the Company
considered nonperformance risk (including credit risk) relating to the debt obligations, including the following: (i) the Company
is considered a low credit risk customer to the lending bank and its creditors; (ii) the Company has a good history of making
timely payments and have never defaulted on any loans; and (iii) the Company has a stable and continuous cash inflow from collections
from its sales-type lease of energy saving projects.   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented
on the balance sheet at FV.  

Stock-Based
Compensation  

The
Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718   Compensation Stock
Compensation,   and FASB ASC Topic 505,   Equity.   The Company recognizes in its statement
of operations FV at the grant date for stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees.  

Basic
and Diluted Earnings per Share  

The
Company presents net income (loss) per share ( EPS ) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260,   Earning
Per Share.    Accordingly, basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted
EPS is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding as well as common share
equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method for stock options and warrants and the if-converted
method for convertible notes.  The Company made an accounting policy election to use the if-converted method for convertible
securities that are eligible to receive common stock dividends, if declared.  Diluted EPS reflect the potential dilution
that could occur based on the exercise of stock options or warrants or conversion of convertible securities using the if-converted
method.  

The
following table presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted EPS for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015:   

Foreign
Currency Translation and Comprehensive Income (Loss)  

The
Company s functional currency is the Renminbi ( RMB ). For financial reporting purposes, RMB were translated
into United States Dollars ( USD  or  $ ) as the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated
at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange
prevailing during the reporting period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to
period are included as a component of stockholders  equity as  Accumulated other comprehensive income.  Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income. There was no significant fluctuation in the exchange
rate for the conversion of RMB to USD after the balance sheet date.  

The
Company uses FASB ASC Topic 220,   Comprehensive Income.   Comprehensive income is comprised of net
income and all changes to the statements of stockholders  equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes
in paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders.  

Segment
Reporting  

FASB
ASC Topic 280,   Segment Reporting,   requires use of the  management approach  model for
segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company s management organizes segments within the
company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography,
legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in which management disaggregates a company. FASB ASC Topic 280 has
no effect on the Company s financial statements as substantially all of the Company s operations are conducted in
one industry segment. All of the Company s assets are located in the PRC.   

New
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in ASU 2016-02 supersedes
the lease recognition requirements in ASC Topic 840, Leases (FAS 13). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities
arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect this standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.   

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present
or future consolidated financial statements.   

3.
RESTRICTED CASH   

Restricted
cash is held by the banks as collateral to issue bank acceptances and bank loans. The Company endorses bank acceptances to
vendors as payment of its obligations.  Most of the bank acceptances have maturities of less than six months. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had restricted cash of $0 and $1.13 million.  

4.

sales-type leases, Xi an TCH leases the following systems: (i) BMPG systems to Pucheng Phase I and II (15 and 11 year
terms, respectively); (ii) BMPG systems to Shenqiu Phase I (11-year term); and (iii) Shenqiu Phase II (9.5-year term).
In addition, as of September 30, 2016, Erdos TCH leased power and steam generating systems from waste heat from metal refining
to Erdos (five systems) for a term of twenty years. The components of the net investment in sales-type leases as of September

raised for Zhonghong, i.e. RMB 9.2 million ($1.5 million) to the Fund Management Company as a consulting fee and it shall pay
such 2% on the amount of funds actually contributed as an annual management fee on every 365-day anniversary thereafter until
Zhonghong fully repays the loan, and the HYREF Fund no longer has an ownership interest in Zhonghong. The Company had $1.15 million
and $0.83 million prepaid consulting expense as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. During the third quarter

LOANS PAYABLE   

Entrusted
Loan Payable   

The
HYREF Fund (Beijing Hongyuan Recycling Energy Investment Center, LLP) established in July 2013 with total fund size of RMB 460
million ($75.0 million) invests in Xi an Zhonghong for Zhonghong s three new CDQ WHPG projects. The HYREF Fund invested
RMB 3 million ($0.5 million) as an equity investment and RMB 457 million ($74.5 million) as a debt investment in Xi an Zhonghong;
in return for such investments, the HYREF Fund will receive an interest payment from Zhonghong for the HYREF Fund s debt
investment. The RMB 457 million ($74.5 million) was released to Zhonghong through an entrusted bank, which is also the supervising
bank for the use of the loan. The loan was deposited to a bank account at the Supervising Bank (the Industrial Bank Xi an
Branch) and is jointly supervised by Zhonghong and the Fund Management Company. Project spending shall be verified by the Fund
Management Company to confirm that it is in accordance with the project schedule before the funds are released. All the operating
accounts of Zhonghong have been opened with the branches of the Supervising Bank and the Supervising Bank has the right to monitor
all bank accounts opened by Zhonghong. The entrusted bank will charge 0.1% of loan amount as service fee and will not take any
lending risk. The loan was collateralized by the accounts receivable and the fixed assets of Shenqiu Phase I and II power generation
systems, the accounts receivable and fixed assets of Zhonghong s three CDQ WHPG systems, and a 27 million RMB capital contribution
made by Xi an TCH. Repayment of the loan (principal and interest) was also jointly and severally guaranteed by Xi an
TCH and the Chairman and CEO of the Company. In the fourth quarter of 2015, three power stations of Erdos TCH were pledged to
Industrial Bank as an additional guarantee for the loan lent to Zhonghong s three CDQ WHPG systems.   

The
loan agreement provides that Zhonghong shall also maintain a certain capital level in its account with the Supervising Bank to
make sure it has sufficient funds to make interest payments when they are due:  

During
    the first three years from the first release of the loan, the balance in its account shall be no less than RMB 7.14 million
    ($1.19 million) on the 20th day of the second month of each quarter and no less than RMB 14.28 million ($2.38 million) on
    the 14th day of the last month of each quarter;   

During
    the fourth year from the first release of the loan, the balance in its account shall be no less than RMB 1.92 million ($0.32
    million) on the 20th day of the second month of each quarter and no less than RMB 3.85 million ($0.64 million) on the 14th
    day of the last month of each quarter; and   

During
    the fifth year from the first release of the loan, the balance in its account shall be no less than RMB 96,300 ($16,050) on
    the 20th day of the second month of each quarter and no less than RMB 192,500 ($32,080) on the 14th day of the last month
    of each quarter.   

The
term of this loan is for 60 months from July 31, 2013 to July 30, 2018. On August 6, 2016, Zhonghong shall repay principal in
the amount of RMB 280 million ($42.22 million); on August 6, 2017, it shall repay principal of RMB 100 million ($16.27 million)
and on July 30, 2018, it shall repay the remainder of RMB 77 million ($12.52 million). The interest rate is 12.5% per year. During
the term, Zhonghong shall maintain a minimal funding level and capital level in its designated account with the Supervising Bank
to make sure it has sufficient funds to make principal payments when they are due. Notwithstanding the requirement, there is a
verbal agreement from the HYREF Fund that for the purpose of the efficient utilization of working capital, Zhonghong does not
have to maintain a minimum funding level in its designated account with the Supervising Bank. As of September 30, 2016, the entrusted
loan payable had an outstanding balance of $60.95 million, of which, $11.23 million was from the investment of Xi an TCH;

Bank
Loan   Bank of Xi an   

On
June 26, 2015, Xi an TCH entered into a loan agreement with Bank of Xi an, whereby Bank of Xi an agreed to loan
$6.29 million (RMB 40 million) to Xi an TCH for one year with maturity on June 25, 2016. The monthly interest rate of the

LONG TERM PAYABLE   FINANCING AGREEMENT FOR SALE LEASE-BACK TRANSACTION   

On

affiliate of China Cinda (HK) Asset Management Co., Ltd, a company organized under the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of China ( Cinda HK ).  

Under
the Cinda Agreement, Xi an TCH transferred its ownership of (i) a set of 7MW steam turbine WHPG systems and (ii) four
furnaces and ancillary apparatus ((i) and (ii) collectively, the  Assets ) to Cinda Financial for $6.72
million (RMB 42.50 million), and Cinda Financial leased the Assets to Xi an TCH for five years for $8.15 million (RMB 51.54
million) based on the transfer cost and benchmark interest rate for five year loans by People s Bank of China ( PBOC )
(then 6.65%) plus 15% of that rate (7.6475%). The interest rate will increase if the five-year benchmark interest rate of PBOC
increases but will remain the same if the benchmark rate decreases in the future. Xi an TCH shall make pro rata quarterly
payments to Cinda Financial for the leasing fees. Upon the completion of the lease term and full payment of all leasing fees and
other fees, Xi an TCH exercised its option to pay $676 (RMB 4,250) to acquire the Assets from Cinda Financial. The quarterly
minimum leasing payment to Cinda Financial is $412,855 (RMB 2.59 million).

by Xi an TCH and Cinda Financial on December 22, 2014. Under the Repayment Agreement, Xi an TCH paid the principal

the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized RMB 21.79 million ($3.27 million) interest income for the sales-type
lease of Pucheng BMPG systems from Pucheng Xin Heng Yuan Biomass Power Generation Corporation, whose major stockholder became

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, prior to repurchase date, the Company recognized RMB 13.83 million ($2.09 million) interest

16. NONCONTROLLING
INTEREST   

On
July 15, 2013, Xi an TCH and HYREF Fund jointly established Xi an Zhonghong New Energy Technology ( Zhonghong )
with registered capital of RMB 30 million ($4.88 million), to manage new projects. Xi an TCH paid RMB 27 million ($4.37
million). Xi an TCH owns 90% of Zhonghong while HYREF Fund owns 10% of Zhonghong as non-controlling interest of Zhonghong.  

In
addition, the HYREF Fund was 16.3% owned by Xi an TCH and 1.1% owned by the Fund Management Company, and the Fund Management
Company was 40% owned by Xi an TCH as described in Note 7, which resulted in an additional indirect ownership of Xi an
TCH in Zhonghong of 1.7%; accordingly, the ultimate non-controlling interest (HYREF Fund) in Zhonghong became 8.3%. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had losses of $227,126 and $23,024 that were attributable to the noncontrolling
interest, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had losses of $79,921 and $6,907
that were attributable to noncontrolling interest, respectively.  

17. INCOME
TAX   

The
Company s Chinese subsidiaries are governed by the Income Tax Law of the PRC concerning privately-run enterprises, which
are generally subject to tax at 25% on income reported in the statutory financial statements after appropriate tax adjustments. 
Under the Chinese tax law, the tax treatment of finance and sales-type leases is similar to US GAAP.  However, the local
tax bureau continues to treat CREG sales-type leases as operating leases. Accordingly, the Company recorded deferred income
taxes.  

The
Company s subsidiaries generate all of their net income from their PRC operations. Yinghua and Shanghai TCH s effective
income tax rate for 2016 and 2015 was 25%. During 2013, Xi an TCH was re-approved for high tech enterprise status and enjoyed
15% preferential income tax rate for three years effective January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015, and is subject to 25% income
tax rate in 2016 unless the renewal of preferential income tax rate is approved by the tax authority. Huahong, Zhonghong and Erdos
TCH s effective income tax rate for 2016 and 2015 was 25%. Yinghua, Shanghai TCH, Xi an TCH, Huahong, Zhonghong
and Erdos TCH file separate income tax returns.  

There
is no income tax for companies domiciled in the Cayman Islands. Accordingly, the Company s consolidated financial statements
do not present any income tax provisions related to Cayman Islands tax jurisdiction where Sifang Holding is domiciled.  

The
US parent company, China Recycling Energy Corporation, is taxed in the US and, as of September 30, 2016, had net operating loss
( NOL ) carry forwards for income taxes of $14.03 million, which may be available to reduce future years 
taxable income as NOLs can be carried forward up to 20 years from the year the loss is incurred. Our management believes the realization
of benefits from these losses may be uncertain due to the US parent company s continuing operating losses. Accordingly,
a 100% deferred tax asset valuation allowance was provided.  

The
following table reconciles the US statutory rates to the Company s effective tax rate for the nine and three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:  

The
provision for income taxes expense for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:  

18. STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION PLAN   

Options
to Employees    

The
Company recorded no compensation expense for stock options to employees during each of the nine and three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015.  

On
June 19, 2015, the stockholders of the Company approved the China Recycling Energy Corporation Omnibus Equity Plan (the  Equity
Plan ) at its annual meeting. The total aggregate shares of common stock authorized for issuance during the term of the
Equity Plan is limited to 12,462,605 shares (prior to the 10:1 reverse split). The Equity Plan was effective immediately upon
the adoption by our Board of Directors on April 24, 2015, subject to stockholder approval, and will terminate on the earliest
to occur of (i) the 10th anniversary of the Equity Plan s effective date, or (ii) the date on which all shares available
for issuance under the Equity Plan shall have been issued as fully-vested shares. No share or option grants have been made to
employees under the Equity Plan as of September 30, 2016.  

Options
to Independent Directors   

On
March 31, 2015, the Board appointed Mr. Cangsang Huang as a member of the Company s Board of Directors to fill a vacancy.
Mr. Huang will serve until his successor has been duly elected and qualified. In connection with the appointment, the Board authorized
the Company to provide Mr. Huang with (i) compensation in the amount of $2,000 per month and (ii) the grant of an option to purchase
40,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock, par value $0.001, at an exercise price equal of $1.02 per share, which was
equal to the closing price per share of the Company s Common Stock on March 31, 2015. Such options were only valid and exercisable
upon stockholder approval. The options to Mr. Huang were not voted upon at the Company s annual stockholder s meeting
on June 19, 2015 and were cancelled automatically. However, the Company s Omnibus Equity Plan ( Plan ) adopted
by the Board on April 24, 2015 for providing equity awards to employees, directors and consultants was approved at the annual
stockholder s meeting; accordingly, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a grant of 40,000 options
(prior to the 10:1 stock split) to Mr. Huang at an exercise price of $1.02 per share under the Plan which vested immediately on
the date of grant, which was on October 10, 2015. The options may be exercised within five years of the date of the grant.   

The
following table summarizes option activity with respect to the independent directors, the number of options reflected 10:1
reverse split effective on May 25, 2016:  

19. CONTINGENCIES   

The
Company s operations in the PRC are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with
companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and
legal environments and foreign currency exchange. The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental
policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates
and methods of taxation, among other things.  

The
Company s sales, purchases and expense transactions are denominated in RMB and all of the Company s assets and liabilities
are also denominated in RMB. The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currencies under the current law. In China, foreign
exchange transactions are required by law to be transacted only by authorized financial institutions. Remittances in currencies
other than RMB may require certain supporting documentation in order to make the remittance.  

The
Company sells electricity to its customers and receives commercial notes (bank acceptance) from them in lieu of payments for accounts
receivable. The Company discounts the commercial notes with the bank or endorses the commercial notes to vendors for payment of
their own obligations or to get cash from third parties. Most of the commercial notes have a maturity of less than six (6) months.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Xi an TCH had outstanding notes receivable of $0.

Shanghai
TCH was established as a foreign investment enterprise in Shanghai under the laws of the PRC on May 25, 2004 and has a registered
capital of $29.80 million. Xi an TCH was incorporated in Xi an, Shaanxi Province under the laws of the PRC on November

(for five recycling waste heat power generating systems); (ii) Pucheng (for two biomass power generation ( BMPG )
systems); and (iii) Shenqiu (for two BMPG systems).  

The
Fund Management Company and the HYREF Fund   

On
June 25, 2013, Xi an TCH and Hongyuan Huifu Venture Capital Co. Ltd ( Hongyuan Huifu ) jointly established Hongyuan
Recycling Energy Investment Management Beijing Co., Ltd (the  Fund Management Company ) with registered capital of
RMB 10 million. Xi an TCH made an initial capital contribution of RMB 4 million ($650,000) and has a 40% ownership interest
in the Fund Management Company. With respect to the Fund Management Company, voting rights and dividend rights are allocated 80%
and 20% between Hongyuan Huifu and Xi an TCH, respectively.   

The
Fund Management Company serves as the general partner of Beijing Hongyuan Recycling Energy Investment Center, LLP (the  HYREF
Fund ), a limited liability partnership established on July 18, 2013 in Beijing. The Fund Management Company made an initial
capital contribution of RMB 5 million ($830,000) to the HYREF Fund. An initial total amount of RMB 460 million ($75 million) has
been fully subscribed by all partners for the HYREF Fund. The HYREF Fund has three limited partners: (1) China Orient Asset
Management Co., Ltd., which made an initial capital contribution of RMB 280 million ($46.67 million) to the HYREF Fund and is
a preferred limited partner; (2) Hongyuan Huifu, which made an initial capital contribution of RMB 100 million ($16.67 million)
to the HYREF Fund and is an ordinary limited partner; and (3) the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Xi an TCH,
which made an initial capital contribution of RMB 75 million ($12.5 million) to the HYREF Fund and is a secondary limited partner.
The term of the HYREF Fund s partnership is six years from the date of its establishment, expiring on July 18, 2019. The
term is three years from the date of contribution for the preferred limited partner, or four years from the date of contribution
for the ordinary limited partner. The total size of the HYREF Fund is RMB 460 million ($75 million). The HYREF Fund was formed
for the purpose of investing in Xi an Zhonghong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd., a 90% owned subsidiary of Xi an TCH,
for the construction of two coke dry quenching ( CDQ ) waste heat power generation ( WHPG ) stations with
Jiangsu Tianyu Energy and Chemical Group Co., Ltd. ( Tianyu ) and one CDQ WHPG station with Boxing County Chengli
Gas Supply Co., Ltd. ( Chengli ).   

Erdos
TCH   Joint Venture   

On
April 14, 2009, the Company formed Erdos TCH as a joint venture (the  JV ) with Erdos Metallurgy Co., Ltd. ( Erdos )
to recycle waste heat from Erdos  metal refining plants to generate power and steam to be sold back to Erdos. The JV has
a term of 20 years with a total investment for the project estimated at $79 million (RMB 500 million) and an initial investment
of $17.55 million (RMB 120 million). Erdos contributed 7% of the total investment for the project, and Xi an TCH contributed
93%. According to Xi an TCH and Erdos  agreement on profit distribution, Xi an TCH and Erdos will receive 80%
and 20%, respectively, of the profit from the JV until Xi an TCH receives the complete return of its investment. Xi an
TCH and Erdos will then receive 60% and 40%, respectively, of the profit from the JV. On June 15, 2013, Xi an TCH and Erdos
entered into a share transfer agreement, pursuant to which Erdos transferred and sold its 7% ownership interest in the JV to Xi an
TCH for $1.29 million (RMB 8 million), plus certain accumulated profits as described below. Xi an TCH paid the $1.29 million
in July 2013 and, as a result, became the sole stockholder of the JV. In addition, Xi an TCH is required to pay Erdos accumulated
profits from inception up to June 30, 2013 in accordance with the supplementary agreement entered on August 6, 2013. In August
2013, Xi an TCH paid 20% of the accumulated profit (calculated under PRC GAAP) of $226,000 to Erdos. The JV currently has
two power generation systems in Phase I with a total of 18MW power capacity, and three power generation systems in Phase II with
a total of 27MW power capacity.  

With
the current economic conditions in China, the government limited and reduced production in the iron and steel industry, which
has resulted in a sharp decrease of Erdos Metallurgy Co., Ltd s production of ferrosilicon, its revenue and cash flows,
and has made it difficult for Erdos to make the monthly minimum lease payment.  

After
considering the challenging economic conditions facing Erdos, and in order to maintain the long-term cooperative relationship
between the parties, which we believe will continue to produce long-term benefits, on April 28, 2016, Erdos TCH and Erdos entered
a supplemental agreement, effective on May 1, 2016. Under the supplemental agreement, Erdos TCH cancelled monthly minimum lease
payments from Erdos, and agreed to charge Erdos based on actual electricity sold at RMB 0.30 / Kwh, which such price will be adjusted
annually based on market condition.   

Shanxi
Datong Coal Group Power Generation Projects   

In
February 2011, Xi an TCH entered into an agreement with Shanxi Datong Coal Group Steel Co., Ltd ( Shanxi Datong )
to recycle gas and steam from groups of blast-furnaces and converters at Shanxi Datong s metal refining plants to generate

Upon the completion of the term, Xi an TCH was to transfer the systems to Baoliyuan at RMB 1.  

If
Baoliyuan wanted to terminate the Agreement early, it was to provide Xi an TCH a 60 day notice and pay the termination fee
and compensation for the damages to Xi an TCH according to the following formula: (i) if it was less than or equal to five
years into the term when Baoliyuan requested termination, Baoliyuan was to pay: Xi an TCH s total investment amount
plus Xi an TCH s average annual investment return times five years minus the years of which the system had already
operated; (ii) if it was more than five years into the term when Baoliyuan requests the termination, Baoliyuan was to pay: Xi an
TCH s total investment amount minus total amortization cost (the amortization period is 20 years).  

The
Baoliyuan project was cancelled in May 2015 because the project required the blasting and leveling of a mountain and Baoliyuan
could not obtain all the necessary permits for the construction from the local government due to the government s concern
for the environment.  

Related
Party Transactions

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated
financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ( US GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements as well as the reported net sales and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate
our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.  

While
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe the
following accounting policies are the most critical to assist you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion
and analysis.  

Basis
of Presentation   

These
accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with US GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the SEC for financial statements.  

Basis
of Consolidation   

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CREG and, its subsidiary, Sifang Holdings and Yinghua; Sifang Holdings 
wholly-owned subsidiaries, Huahong and Shanghai TCH; Shanghai TCH s wholly-owned subsidiary Xi an TCH; and Xi an
TCH s subsidiaries, Erdos TCH, Zhonghong, and Zhongxun. Substantially all of the Company s revenues are derived from
the operations of Shanghai TCH and its subsidiaries, which represent substantially all of the Company s consolidated assets
and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions
were eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates   

In
preparing the consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities in the balance sheets as well as revenues and expenses during the year reported. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.  

Concentration
of Credit Risk   

Cash
includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained within China. Balances at financial institutions within China
are not covered by insurance. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.  

Certain
other financial instruments, which subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist of accounts and other receivables.
The Company does not require collateral or other security to support these receivables. The Company conducts periodic reviews
of its customers  financial condition and customer payment practices to minimize collection risk on accounts receivable.  

The
operations of the Company are located in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results of
operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environments in the PRC.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Sales-type
Leasing and Related Revenue Recognition   

The
Company constructs and then leases waste energy recycling power generating projects to its customers. The Company typically transfers
ownership of the waste energy recycling power generating projects to its customers at the end of each lease. Investment in these
projects is recorded as investment in sales-type leases in accordance with  Accounting for Leases , codified in Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 840 and its various
amendments and interpretations. The Company manufactures and constructs waste energy recycling power generating projects and finances
its customers for the costs of the projects. The sales and cost of sales are recognized at the time of sale or inception of the
lease. The investment in sales-type leases consists of the sum of the total minimum lease payments receivable less unearned interest
income and estimated executory cost. Unearned interest income is amortized to income over the lease term so as to produce a constant
periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease. While a portion of revenue is recognized at the inception of the lease,
the cash flow from the sales-type lease occurs over the course of the lease. Revenue is net of the Value Added Tax.   

Contingent
Rental Income   

The
Company records the income from actual electricity usage in addition to minimum lease payment of each project as contingent rental
income in the period earned. Contingent rent is not part of minimum lease payments.  

Foreign
Currency Translation and Comprehensive Income (Loss)   

The
Company s functional currency is RMB. For financial reporting purposes, RMB figures were translated into USD as the reporting
currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses
are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period. Translation adjustments arising from the
use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of stockholders  equity as  Accumulated
other comprehensive income.  Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in income. There has been
no significant fluctuation in exchange rate for the conversion of RMB to USD after the balance sheet date.  

The
Company uses  Reporting Comprehensive Income  (codified in FASB ASC Topic 220). Comprehensive income is comprised
of net income and all changes to the statements of stockholders  equity, except those due to investments by stockholders,
changes in paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

Comparison
of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

The
following table sets forth the results of our operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales, certain columns
may not add due to rounding.  

SALES.  Total
sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $0, while total sales for the comparable period of 2015 were $1,240, a
decrease of $1,240. Of the total sales, sales of systems for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0. For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had contingent rental income of $0, compared to $1,240 of contingent rental
income from the usage of electricity in addition to the minimum lease payments for the comparable period in 2015. On April 28,
2016, Erdos TCH and Erdos entered a supplemental agreement, effective on May 1, 2016, whereby Erdos TCH cancelled monthly minimum
lease payments from Erdos, and charges Erdos based on actual electricity sold at RMB 0.30 / Kwh. For the sales-type leases, sales
and COS are recorded at the time of the lease; in addition to sales revenue, our other major source of revenue is interest income
from the sales-type leases. 

COST OF SALES.  COS
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0 while our COS for the comparable period of 2015 was $2,719, a decrease of
$2,719. 

GROSS LOSS .
Gross loss was $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,479 for the comparable period of 2015, representing
a blended gross loss margin of nil and -119% for the comparable periods of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in blended
gross loss margin in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to no contingent rental income for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to contingent rental income of $1,240 and cost of sales of $2,719 for the same period of 2015.  

INTEREST INCOME ON SALES-TYPE LEASES  .
Interest income on sales-type leases for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $2.29 million, a $2.88 million decrease
from $5.17 million for the comparable period of 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, interest income was derived
from the following 9 sales-type leases:  

i.  
      Two
    BMPG systems to Pucheng Phase I and II (15 and 11.9 years, respectively);   

ii.  
      One
    BMPG system to Shenqiu Phase I (11 years);   

iii.  
      One
    BMPG system to Shenqiu Phase II (9.5 years);   

iv.  
      Five
    power and steam generating systems to Erdos (20 years).   

In
comparison, during the third quarter of 2015, interest income was derived from the following ten (10) sales-type leases:  

i.  
      Two
    (2) BMPG systems to Pucheng Phase I and II (15 and 11.9 years, respectively);   

ii.  
      One
    (1) BMPG system to Shenqiu Phase I (11 years);   

iii.  
      One
    (1) BMPG system to Shenqiu Phase II (9.5 years);   

iv.  
      Five
    (5) power and steam generating systems to Erdos (20 years); and   

v.  
      One
    (1) WGPG system to Yida (15 years).   

OPERATING
EXPENSES.  Operating expenses consisted of general and administrative expenses totaling $0.30 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $0.54 million for the comparable period of 2015, a decrease of $0.24 million or 45%. The
decrease was mainly due to a $0.03 million decrease in rental expenses and a $0.02 million decrease in payroll expenses
compared to the same period of last year. These decreases in operating expenses were a result of our decreased revenue as well
as the disposal of certain power generating systems.  

NET
NON-OPERATING EXPENSES.  Net non-operating expenses consisted of non-sales-type lease interest income, interest expenses,
bank charges and miscellaneous expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net non-operating expense was $1.42 million
compared to net non-operating expense of $0.57 million for the comparable period of 2015. For the three months ended September
30, 2016, we had $0.04 million interest income and $0.20 million other income, but the amounts were offset by a $1.66 million
interest expense on loans. For the comparable period of 2015, we had $0.05 million interest income, which was offset by $0.59
million interest expense on loans and $0.03 million other expenses.  

INCOME
TAX EXPENSE.  Income tax expense was $0.11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $0.69
million in income tax expense from $0.80 million income tax expense for the comparable period of 2015. The consolidated effective
income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 20% and 20%, respectively; the decrease in income
tax expense in 2016 was mainly due to decreased pretax income compared to the same period of 2015. Xi an TCH s income
tax rate was 15% for 2015 as a result of its high tech enterprise status and is 25% for 2016 due to the expiration of such status.  

NET
INCOME.  Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.54 million compared to net income of $3.27 million
for the comparable period of 2015, a decrease of $2.73 million. This decrease in net income was mainly due to decreased interest income on sales-type leases and increased non-operating expenses in the three months ended September
30, 2016.  

Comparison
of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

The
following table sets forth the results of our operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales, certain columns
may not add due to rounding.  

SALES.  Total
sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $0, while total sales for the comparable period of 2015 were $24.57 million,
a decrease of $24.57 million. Of the total sales, sales of systems for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0
and $24.30 million, respectively; the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the Datong project in 2015. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company had contingent rental income of $0, compared to $0.27 million for the comparable period in
2015. On April 28, 2016, Erdos TCH and Erdos entered a supplemental agreement, effective on May 1, 2016, whereby Erdos TCH cancelled
monthly minimum lease payments from Erdos, and charges Erdos based on actual electricity sold at RMB 0.30 / Kwh. For the sales-type
leases, sales and COS are recorded at the time of the lease. In addition to sales revenue, our other major source of revenue is
interest income from the sales-type leases. 

COST OF SALES.  COS
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0 while our COS for the comparable period of 2015 was $21.32 million, a decrease
of $21.32 million. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of the Datong project in 2015 while no sale of system in 2016. 

GROSS PROFIT .
Gross profit was $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.25 million for the comparable period of 2015,
representing a blended gross margin of nil and 13% for the comparable periods of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in blended
gross margin in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a lack of systems sales and no contingent rental
income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015.  

INTEREST INCOME
ON SALES-TYPE LEASES . Interest income on sales-type leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $10.95 million,
a $7.04 million decrease from $17.99 million for the comparable period of 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
interest income was derived from the following 10 sales-type leases: 

i.  
      Two
    BMPG systems to Pucheng Phase I and II (15 and 11.9 years, respectively);   

ii.  
      One
    BMPG system to Shenqiu Phase I (11 years);   

iii.  
      One
    BMPG system to Shenqiu Phase II (9.5 years);   

iv.  
      Five
    power and steam generating systems to Erdos (20 years); and   

V.
      
      One
    WGPG system to Yida (15 years but sold in 2nd quarter of 2016).   

In
comparison, during the comparable period of 2015, interest income was derived from the following thirteen (13) sales-type leases:  

i.  
      Two
    (2) BMPG systems to Pucheng Phase I and II (15 and 11.9 years, respectively);   

ii.  
      One
    (1) BMPG system to Shenqiu Phase I (11 years);   

iii.  
      One
    (1) BMPG system to Shenqiu Phase II (9.5 years);   

iv.  
      Five
    (5) power and steam generating systems to Erdos (20 years);   

vii.  
      One
    (1) WGPG system to Yida (15 years).   

OPERATING
EXPENSES.  Operating expenses consisted of general and administrative expenses totaling $1.15 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1.78 million for the comparable period of 2015, a decrease of $0.62 million or 35%.
The decrease was mainly due to a $0.07 million decrease in payroll expense, a $0.03 million decrease in travel expenses, a $0.03
million decrease in consulting expenses, and a $0.09 million decrease in rental expenses compared to the same period of last year.
These decreases in operating expenses were a result of our decreased revenue as well as the disposal of certain power generating
systems.  

NET
NON-OPERATING EXPENSES.  Net non-operating expense consisted of non-sales-type lease interest income, interest expenses,
bank charges and miscellaneous expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net non-operating expense was $7.90 million
compared to net non-operating income of $2.29 million for the comparable period of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we had $0.10 million interest income and $0.28 million other income, but the amounts were offset by a $5.04 million interest
expense on loans, a $2.82 million loss from the sale of construction in progress of the Xuzhou Zhongtai project, and a $0.42 million
loss on systems repurchase from Yida. For the comparable period of 2015, we had $2.39 million interest expense on loans, but offset
with $4.56 million gain on systems repurchase from Jitie, $0.11 million interest income, and $0.02 million other income.  

INCOME
TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT).  Income tax benefit was $0.86 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase
of $3.96 million income tax expense from $3.10 million income tax expense for the comparable period of 2015. The consolidated
effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were (46)% and 14%, respectively; the increase
in income tax benefit in 2016 was mainly due to the loss from disposal of fixed assets of Xuzhou Zhongtai and Yida systems per
PRC tax return purpose. Xi an TCH s income tax rate was 15% for 2015 as a result of its high tech enterprise status
and is 25% for 2016 due to expiration of this status.  

NET
INCOME.  Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2.98 million compared to net income of $18.68 million
for the comparable period of 2015, a decrease of $15.70 million. This decrease in net income was mainly due to decreased gross
profit and decreased interest income on sales-type leases in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Comparison
of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and equivalents of $40.68 million, other current assets of $37.42 million, current
liabilities of $56.81 million, working capital of $21.29 million, a current ratio of 1.37:1 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.24:1.  

The
following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015:  

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $30.43 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $51.72 million
provided by operating activities in the comparable period of 2015. The decrease in net cash inflow in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was mainly due to a decrease in net income of $15.91 million, an increase in cash outflow for accounts receivable of
$10.12 million, and a decrease in collection of principal on sales type leases of $29.83 million; however, the decrease in cash
inflow was partially offset by increased cash received in connection with construction in progress by $34.53 million as a result
of disposal of construction in progress of Xuzhou Zhongtai.  

Net
cash provided by investing activities was $1.10 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash used
in investing activities of $0.02 million in the comparable period of 2015. We had $1.10 million cash inflow from change in restricted
cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $0.02 million cash outflow for acquisition of property and equipment
in the same period of 2015.   

Net
cash used in financing activities was $31.46 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash used in
financing activities of $32.46 million for the comparable period of 2015. The cash outflow in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 mainly included $30.47 million repayment of bank loans and $0.99 million repayment of notes payable. In comparison, during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we had $36.57 million repayment of bank loans and $2.38 million repayment of a long-term
payable, offset by $6.48 million proceeds from bank loans.  

We
believe we have sufficient cash to continue our current business through 2016 based on recurring receipts from existing sales-type
leases. As of September 30, 2016, we have five recycling WHPG systems from the Erdos projects and four BMPG systems (two for Pucheng
and two for Shenqiu), all of which generate cash flow. In addition, we have access to bank loans in case of an immediate need
for working capital. We believe we have sufficient cash resources to cover our anticipated capital expenditures in 2016. The 9
systems that are currently in operation have minimum monthly lease payments of RMB 8.08 million ($1.23 million).  

We
do not believe inflation has had or will have a significant negative impact on our results of operations in 2016.  

Transfers
of Cash To and From our Subsidiaries   

The
PRC has currency and capital transfer regulations that require us to comply with certain requirements for the movement of capital.
The Company is able to transfer cash (US Dollars) to its PRC subsidiaries through: (i) an investment (by increasing the Company s
registered capital in a PRC subsidiary), or (ii) a stockholder loan. Except as described below, the Company s subsidiaries
in the PRC have not transferred any earnings or cash to the Company to date. The Company s business is primarily conducted
through its subsidiaries. The Company is a holding company and its material assets consist solely of the ownership interests held
in its PRC subsidiaries. The Company relies on dividends paid by its subsidiaries for its working capital and cash needs, including
the funds necessary: (i) to pay dividends or cash distributions to its stockholders, (ii) to service any debt obligations
and (iii) to pay operating expenses. As a result of PRC laws and regulations (noted below) that require annual appropriations
of 10% of after-tax income to be set aside in a general reserve fund prior to payment of dividends, the Company s PRC subsidiaries
are restricted in that respect, as well as in others respects noted below, in their ability to transfer a portion of their net
assets to the Company as a dividend.  

With
respect to transferring cash from the Company to its subsidiaries, increasing the Company s registered capital in a PRC
subsidiary requires the pre-approval of the local commerce department, while a stockholder loan requires a filing with the state
administration of foreign exchange or its local bureau.  

With
respect to the payment of dividends, we note the following:  

1.  
      PRC
    regulations currently permit the payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits, as determined in accordance with accounting
    standards and PRC regulations (an in-depth description of the PRC regulations is set forth below);   

2.  
      Our
    PRC subsidiaries are required to set aside, at a minimum, 10% of their net income after taxes, based on PRC accounting standards,
    each year as statutory surplus reserves until the cumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50% of their registered capital;   

3.  
      Such
    reserves may not be distributed as cash dividends;   

4.  
      Our
    PRC subsidiaries may also allocate a portion of their after-tax profits to fund their staff welfare and bonus funds; except
    in the event of a liquidation, these funds may also not be distributed to stockholders; the Company does not participate in
    a Common Welfare Fund;   

5.  
      The
    incurrence of debt, specifically the instruments governing such debt, may restrict a subsidiary s ability to pay stockholder
    dividends or make other cash distributions; and   

6.  
      The
    Company is subject to covenants and consent requirements (presently, the Company has all consents necessary).   

If,
for the reasons noted above, our subsidiaries are unable to pay stockholder dividends and/or make other cash payments to the Company
when needed, the Company s ability to conduct operations, make investments, engage in acquisitions, or undertake other activities
requiring working capital may be materially and adversely affected. However, our operations and business, including investment
and/or acquisitions by our subsidiaries within China, will not be affected as long as the capital is not transferred in or out
of the PRC.   

PRC
Regulations   

In
accordance with PRC regulations on Enterprises with Foreign Investment and their articles of association, a foreign-invested enterprise
( FIE ) established in the PRC is required to provide statutory reserves, which are appropriated from net profit,
as reported in the FIE s PRC statutory accounts. An FIE is required to allocate at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit
to the surplus reserve until such reserve has reached 50% of its respective registered capital (based on the FIE s PRC statutory
accounts). The aforementioned reserves may only be used for specific purposes and may not be distributed as cash dividends. Until
such contribution of capital is satisfied, the FIE is not allowed to repatriate profits to its stockholders, unless approved by
the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. After satisfaction of this requirement, the remaining funds may be appropriated
at the discretion of the FIE s board of directors. Our subsidiary, Shanghai TCH, qualifies as an FIE and is therefore subject
to the above-mandated regulations on distributable profits.  

Additionally,
in accordance with PRC corporate law, a domestic enterprise is required to maintain a surplus reserve of at least 10% of its annual
after-tax profit until such reserve has reached 50% of its respective registered capital based on the enterprise s PRC statutory
accounts. A domestic enterprise is also required to provide discretionary surplus reserve, at the discretion of the board of directors,
from the profits determined in accordance with the enterprise s PRC statutory accounts. The aforementioned reserves can
only be used for specific purposes and may not be distributed as cash dividends. Xi an TCH, Huahong, and Erdos TCH were
established as domestic enterprises; therefore, each is subject to the above-mentioned restrictions on distributable profits.  

As
a result of PRC laws and regulations that require annual appropriations of 10% of after-tax income to be set aside, prior to payment
of dividends, in a general reserve fund, the Company s PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion
of their net assets to the Company as a dividend or otherwise.  

Chart
of the Company s Statutory Reserve   

Pursuant
to PRC corporate law, effective January 1, 2006, the Company is required to maintain a statutory reserve by appropriating from
its after-tax profit before declaration or payment of dividends. The statutory reserve represents restricted retained earnings.
Our restricted and unrestricted retained earnings under US GAAP are set forth below:  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties.
We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as stockholders  equity
or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest
in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do
not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support
to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.  

Contractual
Obligations   

Company s
contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 are as follows:  

The
Company believes that it has a stable cash inflow each month and a sufficient channel to commercial institutions to obtain any
loans that may be necessary to meet its working capital needs. Historically, we have been able to obtain loans or otherwise achieve
our financing objectives due to the Chinese government s support for energy-saving businesses with stable cash inflows,
good credit ratings and history. The Company does not believe it will have difficulties related to the repayment of its outstanding
short-term loans.  

Commitments    

Boxing
Chengli Power Generation Projects   

On
July 24, 2013, Zhonghong entered into a Cooperative Agreement of CDQ and CDQ WHPG Project with Boxing County Chengli Gas Supply
Co., Ltd. ( Chengli ), including a supplement agreement entered by the parties on July 26, 2013.   

Pursuant
to the agreements, Zhonghong will design, build and maintain a CDQ system and a 25 MW CDQ WHPG system to supply power to Chengli,
and Chengli will pay energy saving fees. Chengli will contract the operation of the system to a third party contractor that is
mutually agreed to by Zhonghong. In addition, Chengli will provide the land for the CDQ and CDQ WHPG system at no cost to Zhonghong.
The term of the Agreements is 20 years. The energy saving service fees generated by the Project will be charged at RMB 0.42 ($0.068)
per kWh (excluding tax). The operating time shall be based upon an average 8,000 hours annually. If the operating time is less
than 8,000 hours due to a reason attributable to Chengli s, then time charged shall be 8,000 hours a year, and if it is
less than 8,000 hours due to a reason attributable to Zhonghong, then it shall be charged at actual operating hours. The construction
of the Project was completed in the second quarter of 2015, and the Project is currently under commissioning tests which the Company
expects to complete in the first quarter of 2017. From the date of the operation, Chengli shall ensure its coking production line
works properly and that working hours for the CDQ system are no less than 8,000 hours/year, while Zhonghong shall ensure that
working hours and the CDQ WHPG system will be no less than 7,200 hours/year.  

On
July 22, 2013, Xi an Zhonghong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. entered into an EPC General Contractor Agreement for the
Boxing County Chengli Gas Supply Co., Ltd. CDQ Power Generation Project (the  Project ) with Xi an Huaxin New
Energy Co., Ltd. ( Huaxin ). Zhonghong as the owner of the Project contracted EPC for a CDQ and a 25 MW CDQ WHPG system
for Chengli to Huaxin. Huaxin shall provide construction, equipment procurement, transportation, installation and adjustment,
test run, construction engineering management and other necessary works to complete the Project and ensure the CDQ and CDQ WHPG
system for Chengli meet the inspection and acceptance requirements and work normally. The project is a turn-key project and Huaxin
is responsible for the quality, safety, duration and cost of the Project. The total contract price is RMB 200 million ($33.34
million). The price is a cover-all price which includes but is not limited to all the materials, equipment, labor, transportation,
electricity, water, waste disposal, machinery and safety matters. As of September 30, 2016, Zhonghong had paid $30.90 million
for the project, and is committed to pay an additional $5.40 million for the Boxing project.  

Xuzhou
Tian an and Xuzhou Huayu CDQ Power Generation Projects   

On
July 19, 2013, Zhonghong entered into a Cooperative Agreement for Energy Management of CDQ and CDQ WHPG Project (the  Tianyu
Project ) with Jiangsu Tianyu Energy and Chemical Group Co., Ltd. ( Tianyu ).  

Pursuant
to the Tianyu Agreement, Zhonghong will design, build, operate and maintain two sets of 25 MW CDQ and CDQ WHPG systems for two
subsidiaries of Tianyu: one is for and will be located at Xuzhou Tian an Chemical Co., Ltd and one set is for and will be
located at Xuzhou Huayu Coking Co., Ltd.  Upon the completion of the Tianyu Project, Zhonghong will charge Tianyu an energy
saving service fee of RMB 0.534 ($0.088) per kWh (excluding tax).  The operating time shall be based upon an average 8,000
hours annually. If the operating time is less than 8,000 hours a year due to the reason attributable to Tianyu, then time charged
shall be 8,000 hours a year. The construction of the Xuzhou Tian an Project is anticipated to be completed in the first
quarter of 2017. Xuzhou Tian an will provide the land for the CDQ and CDQ WHPG systems for free. Xuzhou Tian an also
guarantees that it will purchase all of the power generated by the CDQ WHPG systems. The Xuzhou Huayu Project is currently on
hold due to a conflict between Xuzhou Huayu Coking Co., Ltd and local residents on certain pollution-related issues. Xuzhou Huayu
Coking Co., Ltd is working actively to resolve the conflict, and we will resume construction as soon as the possible; however,
if the conflict cannot be resolved, either Xuzhou Huayu Coking Co., Ltd or the local residents will be forced to relocate. A relocation
of Xuzhou Huayu Coking Co., Ltd would likely impact the Xuzhou Huayu Project.  

On
July 22, 2013, Xi an Zhonghong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. entered into an EPC General Contractor Agreement for the
Xuzhou Tianyu Group CDQ Power Generation Project (the  Project ) with Xi an Huaxin New Energy Co., Ltd. ( Huaxin ).
Zhonghong as the owner of the Project contracted EPC for the two sets of CDQ and 25 MW CDQ WHPG systems for Tianyu to Huaxin one
for Xuzhou Tian an and one for Xuzhou Huayu. Huaxin shall provide construction, equipment procurement, transportation, installation
and adjustment, test run, construction engineering management and other necessary works to complete the Project and ensure the
CDQ and CDQ WHPG systems for Tianyu meet the inspection and acceptance requirements and work normally. The project is a turn-key
project and Huaxin is responsible for the quality, safety, duration and cost of the Project. The total contract price is RMB 400
million ($66.67 million) of which RMB 200 million ($33.34 million) is for the Xuzhou Tian an system and RMB 200 million
is for the Xuzhou Huayu system. The price is a cover-all price which includes but is not limited to all the materials, equipment,
labor, transportation, electricity, water, waste disposal, machinery and safety matters. As of September 30, 2016, Zhonghong had
paid $29.63 million for the Huayu project and $28.47 million for the Tian an project and is committed to pay an additional
$7.49 million for the Huayu project and $8.65 million for the Tian an project.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

Exchange
Rate Risk   

Our
operations are conducted mainly in the PRC. As such, our earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates
when transactions are denominated in RMB, which is our functional currency. Accordingly, our operating results are affected by
changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and those currencies.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed in the Company s periodic SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s
management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rules 13a  
15(e) and 15d   15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) at the end of the period covered
by the report.  

Based
upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that (i) the information required to be
disclosed by us in this Report was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and (ii) information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

With
the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company
also conducted an evaluation of the Company s internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes
occurred during the Company s fiscal quarter ended as of September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  Based on such evaluation,
management concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, there have not been any changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls   

Our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or
our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will
be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject
to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance
with policies or procedures.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1.
Legal Proceedings   

From
time to time we may be subject to litigation, claims and assessments that arise in the ordinary course of business. Management
believes that any liability resulting from such additional matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. The Company is not a party to any legal proceedings that it believes will have a material
adverse effect upon the conduct of its business or its financial position.  

Item 1A.
Risk Factors   

There
have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. An investment in our common stock involves various risks. When considering an investment
in our company, you should consider carefully all of the risk factors described in our most recent Form 10-K. If any of those
risks, incorporated by reference in this Form 10-Q, occur, the market price of our shares of common stock could decline and investors
could lose all or part of their investment. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us and there may be additional
matters that we are unaware of or that we currently consider immaterial. All of these could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows and, thus, the value of an investment in our company.
