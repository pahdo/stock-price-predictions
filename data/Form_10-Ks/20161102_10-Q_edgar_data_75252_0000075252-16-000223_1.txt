  Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Owens   Minor, Inc. and the subsidiaries it controls (we, us, or our) and contain all adjustments (which are comprised only of normal recurring accruals and use of estimates) necessary to conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. 
  Recently, we have made certain changes to the leadership team, organizational structure, budgeting and financial reporting processes which drive changes to segment reporting. These changes align our operations into   three   distinct business units: Domestic, International and Clinical   Procedural Solutions (CPS). Domestic is our U.S. distribution, logistics and value-added services business, while International is our European distribution, logistics and value-added services business. CPS provides product-related solutions, including surgical and procedural kitting and sourcing. Beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2016, we now report our financial results using this   three   segment structure and have recast prior year segment results on the same basis. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Depreciation and 
  amortization, previously reported as a separate financial statement line item in the consolidated statements of income is now 
  included in distribution, selling and administrative expenses for all periods presented. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.  Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
   
  Note 2 Fair Value 
  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, financing receivables, accounts payable and financing payables included in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market (Level 1) or, if quoted market prices or dealer quotes are not available, on the borrowing rates currently available for loans with similar terms, credit ratings and average remaining maturities (Level 2). We determine the fair value of our derivatives based on estimated amounts that would be received or paid to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on current market prices for applicable currencies. See Note 7 for the fair value of long-term debt and Note 8 for the fair value of derivatives. 
   
  Note 3 Financing Receivables and Payables 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had financing receivables of   $190.7 million   and   $198.5 million   and related payables of   $98.4 million   and   $148.5 million   outstanding under our order-to-cash program and product financing arrangements, which were included in other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. 
   
  Note 4 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
  In connection with our new   three   segment structure, goodwill has been reallocated based on the relative fair value of the underlying reporting units. We performed an interim impairment analysis in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of this change and noted   no   impairment. The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill through   September 30, 2016  : 

8 

Intangible assets at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016  ,   $12.2 million   in net intangible assets were held in the Domestic segment,   $12.0 million   were held in the International segment and   $62.8 million   were held in the CPS segment.  Amortization expense for intangible assets was   $2.2 million   and   $2.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $6.6 million   and   $7.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   
  Based on the current carrying value of intangible assets subject to amortization, estimated amortization expense is   $2.7 million   for the remainder of   2016  ,   $9.7 million   for   2017  ,   $9.1 million   for   2018  ,   $9.0 million   for   2019  ,   $8.9 million   for   2020   and   $8.5 million   for 2021. 
   
  Note 5 Exit and Realignment Charges 
  We periodically incur exit and realignment and other charges associated with optimizing our operations, which includes the consolidation of certain distribution and logistics centers, administrative offices and warehouses in the United States and Europe.  These charges also include costs associated with our strategic organizational realignment which include management changes, certain professional fees and costs to streamline administrative functions and processes.  
  Exit and realignment charges by segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

9 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   $0.4 million   and   $11.6 million   in charges were associated with our voluntary employee separation program and other severance activities.  The following table summarizes the activity related to exit and realignment cost accruals through   September 30, 2016   and 2015:        

  In addition to the exit and realignment accruals in the preceding table, we also incurred   $1.7 million   of costs that were expensed as incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2016, including   $0.7 million   in other facility costs,   $0.5 million   in labor costs,   $0.4 million   in information systems costs, and   $0.1 million   in other costs.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized   $7.4 million   of costs that were expensed as incurred, including   $3.6 million   in consulting costs,   $1.8 million   in information system costs,   $0.7 million   in other facility costs,   $0.5 million   in labor costs, and   $0.8 million   in other costs. 
  In the three months ended September 30, 2015, we also incurred   $3.8 million   of costs that were expensed as incurred, including   $1.2 million   in information system costs,   $1.0 million   in labor costs,   $0.5 million   in professional fees,   $0.4 million   in other facility costs and asset write-downs,   $0.3 million   in accelerated amortization on an information system that has been replaced, and   $0.4 million   in other costs.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we also incurred   $13.8 million   of costs that were expensed as incurred, including   $4.5 million   in accelerated amortization on an information system that has been replaced,   $3.0 million   in other facility costs and asset write-downs,   $2.5 million   in labor costs,   $2.2 million   in information systems costs,   $0.5 million   in professional fees, and   $1.1 million   in other costs.

Note 6 Retirement Plans 
  We have a noncontributory, unfunded retirement plan for certain officers and other key employees in the United States. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. 
  The components of net periodic benefit cost, which are included in distribution, selling and administrative expenses, for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were as follows:   

  Certain of our foreign subsidiaries have health and welfare plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. Our expense for these plans totaled   $0.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $1.3 million   and   $1.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
  Note 7 Debt 
  We have   $275 million   of   3.875%   senior notes due 2021 (the  2021 Notes ) and   $275 million   of   4.375%   senior notes due 2024 (the  2024 Notes ), with interest payable semi-annually. The 2021 Notes were sold at   99.5%   of the principal amount with an effective yield of   3.951%  . The 2024 Notes were sold at   99.6%   of the principal with an effective yield of   4.422%  . We have the option to redeem the 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes in part or in whole prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of   100%   of the principal amount or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted at the Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes was   $284.5 million   and   $273.7 million   and the estimated fair value of the 2024 Notes was   $284.4 million   and   $272.8 million  , respectively.  
  We have a Credit Agreement with a   $450 million   borrowing capacity which extends through September 2019.  Under the Amended Credit Agreement, we have the ability to request   two     one  -year extensions and to request an increase in aggregate commitments by up to   $200 million  . The interest rate on the Amended Credit Agreement, which is subject to adjustment quarterly, is based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate, plus an adjustment based on the better of our debt ratings or leverage ratio (Credit Spread) as defined by the Amended Credit Agreement. We are charged a commitment fee of between 12.5 and 25.0 basis points on the unused portion of the facility. The terms of the Amended Credit Agreement limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and require us to maintain ratios for leverage and interest coverage, including on a pro forma basis in the event of an acquisition.  Based on our leverage ratio at September 30, 2016, the interest rate under the credit facility is LIBOR plus   1.375%  . 
  At September 30, 2016, we had   no   borrowings and letters of credit of approximately   $5.0 million   outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, leaving   $445 million   available for borrowing. We also have a   $1.2 million   letter of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, which supports our facilities leased in Europe.   
  The Amended Credit Agreement and senior notes contain cross-default provisions which could result in the acceleration of payments due in the event of default of either agreement. We believe we were in compliance with our debt covenants at September 30, 2016. 
   
  Note 8 Derivatives 
    When deemed appropriate, we use derivatives, primarily forward contracts, as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of foreign currency exchange risk. At September 30, 2016, we did not have any derivatives outstanding.  The total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives as of December 31, 2015 was   $2.0 million  . In 2016 and 2015, we did not have any derivatives designated as hedging instruments and all gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments were immediately recognized into earnings.  At December 31, 2015, the fair value of our foreign currency contracts included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet was   $0.4 million  . There was   no   impact from changes in the fair value of these foreign currency derivatives included in other operating expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The impact from changes in the fair value of these foreign currency derivatives included in other operating expense was   $0.4 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The impact from changes in the fair value of these foreign currency derivatives included in other operating expense was   $0.3 million   and   $0.1 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. We consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.

Note 9 Income Taxes 
   The effective tax rate was   36.3%   and   37.3%   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   39.8%   and   41.6%   in the same periods of   2015  . The change in rate resulted from a higher percentage of the company's pretax income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions compared to prior year and the deductibility of certain prior year acquisition-related charges for income tax purposes. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits was   $9.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $7.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Included in the liability at   September 30, 2016   were   $4.6 million   of tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. 
   
  Note 10 Net Income per Common Share 
  The following summarizes the calculation of net income per common share attributable to common shareholders for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015. 

Note 11 Shareholders  Equity 
  Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to   $100 million   of our outstanding common stock to be executed at the discretion of management over a   three  -year period, expiring in February 2017. The program is intended, in part, to offset shares issued in conjunction with our stock incentive plans and return capital to shareholders.  The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Purchases under the share repurchase program are made either pursuant to 10b5-1 plans entered into by the company from time to time and/or during the company s scheduled quarterly trading windows for officers and directors. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased in open-market transactions and retired approximately   1.4 million   shares of our common stock for an aggregate of   $48.7 million  , or an average price per share of   $35.29  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we have approximately   $21.3 million   remaining under the repurchase program.   We have elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value to retained earnings.    
  In October 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to   $100 million   of the company s outstanding common stock to be executed at the discretion of management over a   three  -year period. The new authorization will take effect upon the earlier of the completion of the existing authorization, or its expiration. The timing of repurchases and the exact number of shares of common stock to be purchased will depend upon market conditions and other factors and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
  
   12 

Note 12 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 
  The following table shows the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :    

13 

We include amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income related to defined benefit pension plans as a component of net periodic pension cost recorded in distribution, selling and administrative expenses. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, we reclassified   $0.4 million   of actuarial net losses.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we reclassified   $1.2 million   of actuarial net losses. 
   
  Note 13 Segment Information 
  We periodically evaluate our application of accounting guidance for reportable segments and disclose information about reportable segments based on the way management organizes the enterprise for making operating decisions and assessing performance. We report our business under   three   segments: Domestic, International and Clinical   Procedural Solutions (CPS).  The Domestic segment includes our United States distribution, logistics and value-added services business. The International segment consists of our European distribution, logistics and value-added services business. CPS provides product-related solutions, including surgical and procedural kitting and sourcing.  
  We evaluate the performance of our segments based on their operating earnings excluding acquisition-related and exit and realignment charges, certain purchase price fair value adjustments, and other substantive items that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business operations on a regular basis.  Segment assets exclude inter-segment account balances as we believe their inclusion would be misleading or not meaningful. We believe all inter-segment sales are at prices that approximate market.  
  
   14 

The following tables present financial information by segment: 

(    1)    The three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 include   $0.3 million   and   $4.5 million  , respectively in accelerated amortization related to an information system that has been replaced in the International segment.

Note 14 Condensed Consolidating Financial Information 
  The following tables present condensed consolidating financial information for: Owens   Minor, Inc. (O  the guarantors of Owens   Minor, Inc. s 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes, on a combined basis; and the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes, on a combined basis. The guarantor subsidiaries are   100%   owned by Owens   Minor, Inc. Separate financial statements of the guarantor subsidiaries are not presented because the guarantees by our guarantor subsidiaries are full and unconditional, as well as joint and several, and we believe the condensed consolidating financial information is more meaningful in understanding the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the guarantor subsidiaries.

Note 15 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires that our   $3.6   million in debt issuance costs at September 30, 2016 related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. As a result of this adoption, we have also presented   $4.1   million in debt issuance costs from our December 31, 2015 balance sheet in a manner that conforms to the new presentation. The adoption of this standard did not affect our results of operations or cash flows in either the current or prior interim or annual periods. 
  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  . The new standard establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   The amendments in this updated guidance include changes to simplify the Codification for several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
  There has been no change in our significant accounting policies from those contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
   
  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following discussion and analysis describes results of operations and material changes in the financial condition of Owens   Minor, Inc. and its subsidiaries since December 31, 2015. Trends of a material nature are discussed to the extent known and considered relevant. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, related notes thereto, and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Overview 
  Owens   Minor, Inc., along with its subsidiaries, (we, us, or our) is a leading global healthcare services company that connects the world of medical products to the point of care. Recently, we have made certain changes to the leadership team, organizational structure, budgeting and financial reporting processes which drive changes to segment reporting. These changes align our operations into three distinct business units: Domestic, International and Clinical   Procedural Solutions (CPS). Domestic is our U.S. distribution, logistics and value-added services business, while International is our European distribution, logistics and value-added services business. CPS provides product-related solutions, including surgical and procedural kitting and sourcing. Furthermore, the basis for segment reporting shifts from the geography of the end customer to the business unit selling the product or providing the service.  This includes intercompany transactions as well. Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, we now report our financial results using this three segment structure and have recast prior year segment results on the same basis. Segment financial information is provided in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report.

Financial highlights.   The following table provides a reconciliation of reported operating earnings, net income and net income per diluted common share to non-GAAP measures used by management.    

  Net income per diluted share was $0.48 and $1.32 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, an improvement of $0.03 and $0.18 when compared to the same periods of 2015. Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) was $0.51 and $1.53 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decline of $0.03 for the quarter and a year-to-date improvement of $0.09 compared to prior year. Domestic segment operating earnings were $41.0 million and $126.2 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, compared to $42.0 million and $118.5 million for the same periods of 2015.  Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by the previously announced exit of a large customer and lower income from manufacturer product price changes compared to prior year, partially offset by reduced operating expenses. Revenue growth during the first half of the year and expense control initiatives contributed to the increased earnings on a year-to-date basis.  We expect revenue and gross margin to continue to be negatively impacted by this customer exit as well as other competitive dynamics in the fourth quarter of 2016 and into next year. The International segment reported operating earnings of $1.4 million for the quarter and improved by $0.9 million to $3.4 million for the year-to-date period compared to prior year. The improvement was a result of continued cost control and improved operational efficiency. CPS operating earnings of $14.3 million and $41.9 million for the three and nine month periods of 2016 declined compared to prior year by $2.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively, as a result of lower revenues compared to prior year.  
  Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
  Adjusted operating earnings, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these performance measures.  In general, the measures exclude items and charges that (i) management does not believe reflect our core business and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate activities; or (ii) relate to activities or actions that may have occurred over multiple or in prior periods without predictable trends. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate our performance, evaluate the balance sheet, engage in financial and operational planning and determine incentive compensation. 
  Management provides these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on our financial and operating results and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
  The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth above should be carefully evaluated. 
  Acquisition-related charges were $0.6 million and $0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.3 million and $5.7 million for the same periods of 2015.  The current quarter amount related primarily to costs incurred to settle certain obligations and address other on-going matters associated with the acquisitions of ArcRoyal and Medical Action which were partially offset on a year-to-date basis by the first quarter gain on the sale of property acquired with  
  
   23 

Medical Action. Charges in 2015 consisted primarily of costs to continue the integration of Medical Action and ArcRoyal which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 including certain severance and contractual payments to the former owner and costs to transition information technology and other administrative functions. 
  Exit and realignment charges were $2.1 million and $19.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Charges in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016 were associated with severance activities (including our voluntary employee separation program in the first quarter of 2016), and other costs associated with our strategic organizational realignment which include certain professional fees and costs to streamline administrative functions and processes in the United States and Europe. Similar charges in 2015 totaled $4.8 million and $16.1 million in the comparable periods and also included the consolidation of distribution and logistics centers and closure of offsite warehouses in the United States and Europe. More information about these charges is provided in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report. 
  These charges have been tax effected in the preceding table by determining the income tax rate depending on the amount of charges incurred in different tax jurisdictions and the deductibility of those charges for income tax purposes.  
  Results of Operations 
  Net revenue.      

Consolidated net revenue declined in the third quarter of 2016 primarily as a result of the previously announced exit of a large domestic customer and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 to be negatively impacted by this customer exit as well. On a year-to-date basis, growth with our other large healthcare provider customers and an additional sales day in the first quarter of 2016 contributed to the improvement compared to 2015.  In the International segment, excluding the impact of a U.K.-based customer exit last year and the negative impact of foreign exchange, revenues declined by $0.9 million for the quarter and $3.8 million year-to-date. CPS revenue for the quarter was impacted by temporary production challenges in capacity and workforce availability but was relatively consistent on a year-to-date basis compared to 2015. 
  
   24 

Cost of goods sold.    

Cost of goods sold includes the cost of the product (net of supplier incentives and cash discounts) and all costs incurred for shipments of products from manufacturers to our distribution centers for all customer arrangements where we are the primary obligor, bear risk of general and physical inventory loss and carry all credit risk associated with sales.  These are sometimes referred to as distribution or buy/sell contracts.  Cost of goods sold also includes direct and certain indirect labor, material and overhead costs associated with our kitting businesses.  There is no cost of goods sold associated with our fee-for-service business.  As a result of the factors discussed above which impacted sales activity through our distribution and kitting businesses, cost of goods sold decreased from prior year by $46.0 million and increased $80.0 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively.   
  Gross margin.      

The decreases in gross margin compared to the prior year were largely attributable to lower income from manufacturer product price changes, the previously announced exit of a large domestic customer in September 2016 and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $3.9 million for the quarter and $6.6 million year-to-date.  The exit of a U.K.-based customer in July 2015 also negatively impacted the year-to-date comparison.  These impacts were partially offset by increased margin due to revenue growth from other large customer accounts. With increasing customer cost pressures and competitive dynamics in healthcare, we believe that we will experience increased gross margin pressure in the fourth quarter and next year.    
  Operating expenses.   

25 

Distribution, selling and administrative (DS A) expenses include labor and warehousing costs associated with our distribution and logistics services and all costs associated with our fee-for-service arrangements. Shipping and handling costs are included in DS A expenses and include costs to store, move, and prepare products for shipment, as well as costs to deliver products to customers. The costs to convert new customers to our information systems are included in DS A and are generally incurred prior to the recognition of revenues from the new customers. 
  The decrease in DS A expenses compared to prior year reflected the decreased sales activity in the quarter, benefits of cost control initiatives, lower fuel costs and improved operational efficiency as well as favorable foreign currency translation impacts of $3.9 million and $6.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.     
  The increase in other operating income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 was attributed primarily to an expense for the settlement of a legal matter in the prior year which did not re-occur in the current period.   
  A discussion of acquisition-related and exit and realignment charges is included above in the Overview section. 
  Interest expense, net. 

Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was consistent with prior year. 
     Income taxes. 

The changes in the effective tax rate compared to 2015 resulted from a higher percentage of the company's pretax income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions compared to prior year and the deductibility of certain prior year acquisition-related charges for income tax purposes.  
  
   26 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Financial condition  .    We monitor operating working capital through days sales outstanding (DSO) and merchandise inventory turnover.  We estimate a hypothetical increase (decrease) in DSO of one day would result in a decrease (increase) in our cash balances, an increase (decrease) in borrowings against our revolving credit facility, or a combination thereof of approximately $25 million. 
  The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held in cash depository accounts with major banks in the United States and Europe or invested in high-quality, short-term liquid investments. Changes in our working capital can vary in the normal course of business based upon the timing of inventory purchases, collection of accounts receivable, and payment to suppliers.   

  (1) Based on period end accounts receivable and net revenue for the quarter 
  (2) Based on average annual inventory and annualized cost of goods sold for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015  
  Liquidity and capital expenditures.   The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

  Cash provided by operating activities was $  143.8 million   in the first nine months of 2016, compared to $206.0 million in the same period of 2015. The decrease in cash from operating activities for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to changes in working capital, including the effects of the customer exit in the quarter, and timing of payments to vendors in the prior year.  
  Cash used for investing activities was $  16.3 million   in the first nine months of 2016, compared to $32.1 million in the same period of 2015.  Investing activities in 2016 and 2015 relate to capital expenditures for our strategic and operational efficiency initiatives, particularly initiatives relating to information technology enhancements and optimizing our distribution network.  Cash used for investing activities in 2016 was partially offset by $4.5 million in proceeds from the sale of property.  
  Cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2016 was $  82.1 million  , compared to $103.0 million used in the same period of 2015.  During the first nine months of 2016, we paid dividends of $47.8 million (compared to $47.8 million in 2015), repurchased common stock under a share repurchase program for $48.7 million (compared to $15.8 million in 2015) and made no payments on our Amended Credit Agreement (compared to $33.7 million in repayments in 2015).  Financing activities in the current period also included $21.8 million in a bank overdraft related to timing of payments and collections in our order-to-cash business at September 30, 2016. 
  Capital resources.   Our sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents and a revolving credit facility. On September 17, 2014, we amended our existing Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A. and a syndicate of financial institutions (the Amended Credit Agreement) increasing our borrowing capacity from $350 million to $450 million and extending the term through 2019. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, we have the ability to request two one-year extensions and to request an increase in aggregate commitments by up to $200 million.  The interest rate on the Amended Credit Agreement, which is subject to adjustment quarterly, is based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate, plus an adjustment based on the better of our debt ratings or  
  
   27 

leverage ratio (Credit Spread) as defined by the Amended Credit Agreement. We are charged a commitment fee of between 12.5 and 25.0 basis points on the unused portion of the facility. The terms of the Amended Credit Agreement limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and require us to maintain ratios for leverage and interest coverage, including on a pro forma basis in the event of an acquisition.  We may utilize the revolving credit facility for long-term strategic growth, capital expenditures, working capital and general corporate purposes. If we were unable to access the revolving credit facility, it could impact our ability to fund these needs. Based on our leverage ratio at September 30, 2016, the interest rate under the credit facility is LIBOR plus 1.375%. 
  At September 30, 2016, we had no borrowings and letters of credit of approximately $5.0 million outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, leaving $445 million available for borrowing. We also have a $1.2 million letter of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 which supports our facilities leased in Europe. 
  We have $275 million of 3.875% senior notes due 2021 (the  2021 Notes ) and $275 million of 4.375% senior notes due 2024 (the  2024 Notes ). The 2021 Notes were sold at 99.5% of the principal amount with an effective yield of 3.951%. The 2024 Notes were sold at 99.6% of the principal amount with an effective yield of 4.422%. Interest on the 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears, which commenced on March 15, 2015 and December 15, 2014, respectively. We have the option to redeem the 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes in part or in whole prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted at the Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points. 
  In the third quarter of 2016, we paid cash dividends on our outstanding common stock at the rate of $0.255 per share, which represents a 1.0% increase over the rate of $0.2525 per share paid in the third quarter of 2015.  We anticipate continuing to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment of future dividends remains within the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. 
  In February 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock to be executed at the discretion of management over a three-year period, expiring in February 2017. The program is intended, in part, to offset shares issued in conjunction with our stock incentive plan and return capital to shareholders.  The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  Purchases under the share repurchase program are made either pursuant to 10b5-1 plans entered into by the company from time to time and/or during the company s scheduled quarterly trading windows for officers and directors. During the first nine months of  2016, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for $48.7 million under this program.  At September 30, 2016, the remaining amount authorized for repurchase under this program was $21.3 million.  
  In October 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $100 million of the company s outstanding common stock to be executed at the discretion of management over a three-year period. The new authorization will take effect upon the earlier of the completion of the existing authorization, or its expiration. The timing of repurchases and the exact number of shares of common stock to be purchased will depend upon market conditions and other factors and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
  We earn a portion of our operating earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside the U.S., which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, no U.S. federal and state income taxes and withholding taxes have been provided on these earnings.  Our cash, cash-equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $34.6 million and $46.0 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds or other assets held outside the U.S. In the future, should we require more capital to fund discretionary activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through our borrowings, we could elect to repatriate cash or other assets from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. 
  We believe available financing sources, including cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, long-term strategic growth, payments under long-term debt and lease arrangements, payments of quarterly cash dividends, share repurchases and other cash requirements. While we believe that we will have the ability to meet our financing needs in the foreseeable future, changes in economic conditions may impact (i) the ability of financial institutions to meet their contractual commitments to us, (ii) the ability of our customers and suppliers to meet their obligations to us or (iii) our cost of borrowing.

     We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to our revolving credit facility. We had no outstanding borrowings and approximately $5.0 million in letters of credit under the revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016  .  A hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in a potential reduction in future pre-tax earnings of approximately $0.1 million per year for every $10 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. 
  Due to the nature and pricing of our Domestic segment distribution services, we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices. Our strategies for helping to mitigate our exposure to changing domestic fuel prices has included entering into leases for trucks with improved fuel efficiency. We benchmark our domestic diesel fuel purchase prices against the U.S. Weekly Retail On-Highway Diesel Prices (benchmark) as quoted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The benchmark averaged $2.25 per gallon in the first nine months of 2016, a decrease from $2.80 per gallon in the first nine months of 2015. Based on our fuel consumption in the first nine months of 2016, we estimate that every 10 cents per gallon increase in the benchmark would reduce our Domestic segment operating earnings by approximately $0.3 million on an annualized basis.   
  In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency translation and transaction risks. Our business transactions outside of the United States are primarily denominated in the Euro and British Pound. We may use foreign currency forwards, swaps and options, where possible, to manage our risk related to certain foreign currency fluctuations. However, we believe that our foreign currency transaction risks are low since our revenues and expenses are typically denominated in the same currency. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  We carried out an evaluation, with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  Part II. Other Information 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  Certain legal proceedings pending against us are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Through   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material developments in any legal proceedings reported in such Annual Report. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  Certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Through   September 30, 2016  , we have added the following risk factor.  There have been no other material changes in the risk factors described in such Annual Report. 
  United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union     
  Our International segment has operations throughout the European Union (the  E.U. ), including the United Kingdom (the  U.K. ). On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as  Brexit . As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K. s withdrawal from the E.U. A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the E.U., and disrupt trade between the U.K. and the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent and recent occurrence of these events, we are monitoring the situation but it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. would have and how such withdrawal may affect our operations or financial performance.  
  
   30 

Table of Contents  

The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our operating results. The announcement of Brexit and the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. may also create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers and suppliers to take unexpected actions. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 
   
  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  In February 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock to be executed at the discretion of management over a three-year period, expiring in February 2017. The program is intended, in part, to offset shares issued in conjunction with our stock incentive plan and return capital to shareholders. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Purchases under the share repurchase program are made either pursuant to 10b5-1 plans entered into by the company from time to time and/or during the company s scheduled quarterly trading windows for officers and directors.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased in open-market transactions and retired 0.8 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $27.8 million, or an average price per share of $34.60. The following table summarizes share repurchase activity by month during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 

In October 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $100 million of the company s outstanding common stock to be executed at the discretion of management over a three-year period. The new authorization will take effect upon the earlier of the completion of the existing authorization, or its expiration. The timing of repurchases and the exact number of shares of common stock to be purchased will depend upon market conditions and other factors and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
