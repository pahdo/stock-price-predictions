1.  Significant Accounting Policies   
 The information included in the foregoing interim condensed consolidated financial statements is unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the 2015 Combined Form 10-K as updated by the Company and Lamar Media s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on July 11, 2016. Subsequent events, if any, are evaluated through the date on which the financial statements are issued.  

2.  Acquisitions  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company completed several acquisitions of outdoor advertising assets for a total purchase price of $535,029, of which $526,029 was in cash and $9,000 in non-cash consideration consisting principally of exchanges of outdoor advertising assets.  The purchases included the acquisition of assets in five U.S. markets from Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $458,500.  As a result of the acquisitions, a gain of $8,599 was recorded for transactions which involved the exchanges of outdoor advertising assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Each of these acquisitions was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, and, accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of each acquired entity from the date of acquisition. The acquisition costs have been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary fair market value estimates at the dates of acquisition. The following is a summary of the allocation of the acquisition costs in the above transactions.  

The following unaudited pro forma financial information for the Company gives effect to the 2016 and 2015 acquisitions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2015. These pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations which actually would have resulted had the acquisitions occurred on such date or to project the Company s results of operations for any future period.

    3.   Stock-Based Compensation   
 Equity Incentive Plan.  Lamar Advertising s 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, (the  Incentive Plan ) has reserved 15.5 million shares of Class A common stock for issuance to directors and employees, including shares underlying granted options and common stock reserved for issuance under its performance-based incentive program. Options granted under the plan expire ten years from the grant date with vesting terms ranging from three to five years and include 1) options that vest in one-fifth increments beginning on the grant date and continuing on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date and 2) options that cliff-vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date. All grants are made at fair market value based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant.   
 We use a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based awards. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model incorporates various and highly subjective assumptions, including expected term and expected volatility. The Company granted options for an aggregate of 86,000 shares of its Class A common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016 a total of 1,466,193 shares were available for future grant.  
 Stock Purchase Plan.  Lamar Advertising s 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or 2009 ESPP  was approved by our shareholders on May 28, 2009.  The number of shares of Class A common stock available under the 2009 ESPP was automatically increased by 82,084 shares on January 1, 2016 pursuant to the automatic increase provisions of the 2009 ESPP.   
 The following is a summary of 2009 ESPP share activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:    

Performance-based compensation.  Unrestricted shares of our Class A common stock may be awarded to key officers, employees and directors under our 1996 Equity Incentive Plan. The number of shares to be issued, if any, will be dependent on the level of achievement of performance measures for key officers and employees, as determined by the Company s Compensation Committee based on our 2016 results. Any shares issued based on the achievement of performance goals will be issued in the first quarter of 2017. The shares subject to these awards can range from a minimum of 0% to a maximum of 100% of the target number of shares depending on the level at which the goals are attained. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has recorded $11,800 as stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based awards. In addition, each non-employee director automatically receives upon election or re-election a restricted stock award of our Class A common stock. The awards vest 50% on grant date and 50% on the last day of the directors  one year term. The Company recorded a $301 stock-based compensation expense related to these awards for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

4.  Depreciation and Amortization   
 The Company includes all categories of depreciation and amortization on a separate line in its Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

    5.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

6.  Asset Retirement Obligations

The following table reflects information related to our asset retirement obligations: 

7.  Distribution Restrictions   
 Lamar Media s ability to make distributions to Lamar Advertising is restricted under both the terms of the indentures relating to Lamar Media s outstanding notes and by the terms of its senior credit facility. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Lamar Media was permitted under the terms of its outstanding senior subordinated and senior notes to make transfers to Lamar Advertising in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances in amounts up to $2,639,956 and $2,487,196, respectively.  
 As of September 30, 2016, transfers to Lamar Advertising are permitted under Lamar Media s senior credit facility and as defined therein, unless, after giving effect to such distributions, (i) the total debt ratio is equal to or greater than 6.0 to 1 or (ii) the senior debt ratio is equal to or greater than 3.5 to 1. As of September 30, 2016, the total debt ratio was less than 6.0 to 1 and Lamar Media s senior debt ratio was less than 3.5 to 1; therefore, dividends or distributions to Lamar Advertising were not subject to any additional restrictions under the senior credit facility. In addition, as of September 30, 2016 the senior credit facility allows Lamar Media to conduct its affairs in a manner that would allow Lamar Advertising to qualify and remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, including by allowing Lamar Media to make distributions to Lamar Advertising required for Lamar Advertising to qualify and remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, subject to certain restrictions.  

8.  Earnings Per Share   
 The calculation of basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effect of stock options, while diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of stock options. There were no dilutive shares excluded from this calculation resulting from their anti-dilutive effect for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

 Long-term debt consists of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:     

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company adopted the FASB s Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs .  The pronouncement requires the Company to present debt issuance costs related to a note as a direct deduction from the face amount of the note presented in the balance sheet.  The Company has applied the new guidance on a retrospective basis.  The effects of the adoption to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 were a decrease in total assets, current maturities of long-term debt and long term debt of $28,034, $4,823 and $23,211, respectively.

Incremental loans may be in the form of additional term loan tranches or increases in the revolving credit facility. Our lenders have no obligation to make additional loans to us, or any designated   subsidiary borrower, under the incremental facility, but may enter into such commitments in their sole discretion.   
 On April 18, 2014, Lamar Media entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the  First Amendment ) under which the parties agreed to amend Lamar Media s existing senior credit agreement on the terms set forth therein. The First Amendment created a new $300,000 Term A Loan facility (the  Term A Loans ) and made certain other amendments. Lamar Media borrowed $300,000 in Term A Loans on April 18, 2014. The net loan proceeds of this borrowing, together with borrowings under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility and cash on hand, were used to fund the redemption and retirement of all $400,000 in outstanding principal amount of Lamar Media s 7 7/8% Notes due 2018 on April 21, 2014.  On March 4, 2016, Lamar Media entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the  Second Amendment ) under which the parties agreed to amend Lamar Media s existing senior credit agreement on the terms set forth therein.  Among certain other amendments, the Second Amendment eliminated the $500,000 cap on incremental loans with the result that Lamar Media may borrow incremental term and revolving loans without monetary limits, so long as Lamar Advertising s Senior Debt Ratio does not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. 
 The Term A Loans began amortizing on June 30, 2014 in quarterly installments on each September 30, December 31, March 31, and June 30 thereafter, as follows:    

The Term A Loans bear interest at rates based on the Adjusted LIBO Rate ( Eurodollar loans ) or the Adjusted Base Rate ( Base Rate loans ), at Lamar Media s option. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 2.0% (or the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 1.75% at any time the Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1). Base Rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Base Rate plus 1.00% (or the Adjusted Base Rate plus 0.75% at any time the Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1). The revolving credit facility bears interest at rates based on the Adjusted LIBO Rate ( Eurodollar loans ) or the Adjusted Base Rate ( Base Rate loans ), at Lamar Media s option. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 2.25% (or the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 2.00% at any time the Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 4.25 to 1; or the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 1.75% at any time the Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1). Base Rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Base Rate plus 1.25% (or the Adjusted Base Rate plus 1.0% at any time the total debt ratio is less than or equal to 4.25 to 1; or the Adjusted Base Rate plus 0.75% at any time the Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1). The guarantees, covenants, events of default and other terms of the senior credit facility apply to the Term A Loans and revolving credit facility.  
 As of September 30, 2016, there was $206,000 outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Availability under the revolving facility is reduced by the amount of any letters of credit outstanding. Lamar Media had $9,104 in letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2016 resulting in $184,896 of availability under its revolving facility. Revolving credit loans may be requested under the revolving credit facility at any time prior to its maturity on February 2, 2019, and bear interest, at Lamar Media s option, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted Base Rate plus applicable margins, such margins are set at an initial rate with the possibility of a step down based on Lamar Media s ratio of debt to trailing four quarters EBITDA, as defined in the senior credit facility.

    The t  erms of Lamar Media s senior credit facility and the indentures relating to Lamar Media s outstanding notes restrict, among other things, the ability of Lamar Advertising and Lamar Media to:   

dispose of assets;      

incur or repay debt;      

create liens;      

make investments; and      

pay dividends.      

 The senior credit facility contains provisions that allow Lamar Media to conduct its affairs in a manner that allows Lamar Advertising to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT, including by allowing Lamar Media to make distributions to Lamar Advertising required for the Company to qualify and remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, subject to certain restrictions.  
 Lamar Media s ability to make distributions to Lamar Advertising is also restricted under the terms of these agreements. Under Lamar Media s senior credit facility the Company must maintain a specified senior debt ratio at all times and in addition, must satisfy a total debt ratio in order to incur debt, make distributions or make certain investments.  
 Lamar Advertising and Lamar Media were in compliance with all of the terms of their indentures and the senior credit facility provisions during the periods presented.  

10.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s financial instruments included cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable and borrowings. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt approximated carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Investment contracts are reported at fair values. Fair values for investments held at cost are not readily available, but are estimated to approximate fair value. The estimated fair value of the Company s long-term debt (including current maturities) was $2,517,113 which exceeded the carrying amount of $2,410,254 as of September 30, 2016. The majority of the fair value is determined using observed prices of publicly traded debt (level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) and the remaining is valued based on quoted prices for similar debt (level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).  

11.  New Accounting Pronouncements   
 In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 deferring the effective date from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018, while allowing for early adoption as of January 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases . The update is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about lease arrangements. The amendments in this update are effective beginning January 1, 2019 with retrospective application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update to determine the effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .   The update is designed to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The update is

  effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this update will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statemen  ts.  
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The update clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows.  The update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update will have a material impact on its statement of cash flows. 

12.  Dividends/Distributions   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company declared and paid cash distributions of its REIT taxable income in an aggregate amount of $73,938 or $0.76 per share and $66,634 or $0.69 per share, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company declared and paid cash distributions of its REIT taxable income in an aggregate amount of $219,584 or $2.26 per share and $198,448 or $2.06 per share, respectively. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company s control, including financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, the Company s ability to utilize net operating losses to offset, in whole or in part, the Company s distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs) and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company paid cash dividend distributions to holders of its Series AA Preferred Stock in an aggregate amount of $91 or $15.95 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company paid cash dividend distributions to holders of its Series AA Preferred Stock in an aggregate amount of $273 or $47.85 per share.  

13.  Information about Geographic Areas   
 Revenues from external customers attributable to foreign countries totaled $8,489 and $8,830 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $24,076 and $24,089 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net carrying value of long lived assets located in foreign countries totaled $5,360 and $5,613 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. All other revenues from external customers and long lived assets relate to domestic operations.

2.  Summarized Financial Information of Subsidiaries  
   
 In the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2015, which was originally filed with the SEC on November 5, 2015, we omitted certain required disclosures under SEC Regulation S-X Rule 3-10, Financial Statements of Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities Registered or Being Registered. Accordingly, we have revised our financial statement footnotes to correct this immaterial error of omission and include the information presented below. This revision was determined to be immaterial to the financial statements previously presented. 
  Separate condensed consolidating financial information for Lamar Media, subsidiary guarantors and non-guarantor subsidiaries are presented below. Lamar Media and its subsidiary guarantors have fully and unconditionally guaranteed Lamar Media s obligations with respect to its publicly issued notes. All guarantees are joint and several. As a result of these guarantee arrangements, we are required to present the following condensed consolidating financial information. The following condensed consolidating financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. The condensed consolidating financial information is provided as an alternative to providing separate financial statements for guarantor subsidiaries. Separate financial statements of Lamar Media s subsidiary guarantors are not included because the guarantees are full and unconditional and the subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned and jointly and severally liable for Lamar Media s outstanding publicly issued notes. The accounts for all companies reflected herein are presented using the equity method of accounting for investments in subsidiaries.

You should carefully consider each of these risks and uncertainties in evaluating the Company s and Lamar Media s financial conditions and results of operations. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this document. These statements speak only as of the date of this document, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the statements, except as may be required by law.  
   
 LAMAR ADVERTISING COMPANY  
 The following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related notes thereto.  
 Overview  
 The Company s net revenues are derived primarily from the rental of advertising space on outdoor advertising displays owned and operated by the Company. Revenue growth is based on many factors that include the Company s ability to increase occupancy of its existing advertising displays; raise advertising rates; and acquire new advertising displays and its operating results are therefore affected by general economic conditions, as well as trends in the advertising industry. Advertising spending is particularly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions which affect the rates that the Company is able to charge for advertising on its displays and its ability to maximize advertising sales or occupancy on its displays.  
 Historically, the Company has made strategic acquisitions of outdoor advertising assets to increase the number of outdoor advertising displays it operates in existing and new markets. The Company continues to evaluate and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise. The Company has financed its historical acquisitions and intends to finance any future acquisition activity from available cash, borrowings under its senior credit facility or the issuance of debt or equity securities. See- Liquidity and Capital Resources -Sources of Cash   for more information. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company completed 18 acquisitions for a total cash purchase price of approximately $526.0 million.  See - Uses of Cash-Acquisitions   for more information.  
 The Company s business requires expenditures for maintenance and capitalized costs associated with the construction of new billboard displays, the entrance into and renewal of logo sign and transit contracts, and the purchase of real estate and operating equipment.  
 The following table presents a breakdown of capitalized expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:    

28 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures   
 Our management reviews our performance by focusing on several key performance indicators not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ( GAAP ). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  
 Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA ), Funds From Operations ( FFO ), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Adjusted Funds From Operations ( AFFO ) and acquisition-adjusted net revenue.  
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before income tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income), gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and investments, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on disposition of assets and investments.  
 FFO is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate assets and investments and real estate related depreciation and amortization and including adjustments to eliminate non-controlling interest.  
 We define AFFO as FFO before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) non-cash tax expense (benefit); (iv) non-real estate related depreciation and amortization; (v) amortization of deferred financing and debt issuance costs; (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt; (vii) non-recurring infrequent or unusual losses (gains); (viii) less maintenance capital expenditures; and (ix) an adjustment for non-controlling interest.  
 Acquisition-adjusted net revenue adjusts our net revenue for the prior period by adding to it the net revenue generated by the acquired assets before our acquisition of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the current period. In calculating acquisition-adjusted revenue, therefore, we include revenue generated by assets that we did not own in the period but acquired in the current period. We refer to the amount of pre-acquisition revenue generated by the acquired assets during the prior period that corresponds with the current period in which we owned the assets (to the extent within the period to which this report relates) as  acquisition net revenue . In addition, we also adjust the prior period to subtract revenue generated by the assets that have been divested since the prior period and, therefore, no revenue derived from those assets is reflected in the current period.  
 Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. Specifically, we believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating our core operating results; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the industry to measure operating performance as it excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization, which may vary significantly among companies, depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (3) Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance because they eliminate items that are not operational in nature and reflect the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs; (4) acquisition-adjusted net revenue is a supplement to net revenue to enable investors to compare period over period results on a more consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions and divestures, which reflects our core performance and organic growth (if any) during the period in which the assets were owned and managed by us; and (5) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies.  
 Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included herein.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
 Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 compared to Nine Months ended September 30, 2015  
 Net revenues increased $116.2 million or 11.6% to $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $997.4 million for the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $95.8 million, which represents an increase of 10.9% over the same period in 2015, primarily due to the integration of outdoor assets acquired since July 1, 2015, which included five new U.S. markets in January 2016 from Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and the addition of approximately 300 digital displays since October 1, 2015.   In addition, logo sign revenue increased $3.8 million, which represents an increase of 6.9% over the prior period and there was a $16.5 million increase in transit revenue, which represents an increase of 25.8% over the prior period, primarily due to the acquisition of Alliance Airports in July 2015. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was a $35.2 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which represents an increase of 3.3%. See  Reconciliations  below. The $35.2 million increase in revenue primarily consists of a $27.3 million increase in billboard revenue, a $5.2 million increase in transit revenue and a $2.7 million increase in logo revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2015.  
 Total operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $67.4 million to $649.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $582.0 million in the same period in 2015. The $67.4 million increase over the prior year is comprised of a $63.7 million increase in direct and general and administrative operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets and corporate expense increases of $3.7 million.  
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.3 million, or 5.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired in the five new U.S. markets purchased in January 2016. 
 Due to the above factors, operating income increased to $323.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $278.2 million for the same period in 2015.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a $3.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the prepayment of Lamar Media s Term A-1 loan under its senior credit facility.  
 Interest expense increased $18.5 million from $74.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to $92.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily resulting from the January 2016 issuance of Lamar Media s $400 million in aggregate 5 3/4% Senior Notes due in 2026 (the  5 3/4% Senior Notes ).  
 The increase in operating income offset by the increases in interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment resulted in a $23.7 million increase in income before income taxes. The Company recognized $9.7 million in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is approximately 4.3%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.  
 As a result of the above factors, the Company recognized net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $218.3 million, as compared to net income of $186.0 million for the same period in 2015.  
 Reconciliations:  
 Because acquisitions or dispositions occurring after December 31, 2014 (the  acquired assets ) have contributed to or reduced our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2015 net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Reconciliations of 2015 reported net revenue to 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, as well as a comparison of 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2016 reported n  et revenue for the nine months ended September 30, are provided below:

Key Performance Indicators  
 Net Income/Adjusted EBITDA 
 (in thousands) 

Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 11.8% to $483.8 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense) of $73.8 million, and was partially offset by an increase in general administrative and corporate expense of $22.9 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.  
 31 

Net Income/FFO/AFFO   
 (in thousands) 

FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $349.0 million as compared to FFO of $312.5 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO for nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 12.7% to $360.0 million as compared to $319.5 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense), partially offset by increases in general and administrative expense, corporate expense and interest expense over the comparable period in 2015.  
   
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
 Three Months ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three Months ended September 30, 2015  
 Net revenues increased $36.8 million or 10.5% to $387.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $350.7 million for the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $34.1 million, which represents an increase of 11.1% over the same period in 2015, primarily due to the integration of outdoor assets acquired since July 1, 2015 which included the acquisition of five new U.S. markets in January 2016 from Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and the addition of approximately 300 digital displays since October 1, 2015, as well as an increase in political advertising sales.  In addition, logo sign revenue increased $1.2 million, which represents an increase of 6.7% over the prior period and there was a $1.5 million increase in transit revenue, which represents an increase of 5.7% over the prior period.  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, there was a $13.3 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015, which represents an increase of 3.6%. See  Reconciliations  below. The $13.3 million increase in revenue primarily consists of a $10.4 million increase in billboard revenue, a $2.1 million increase in transit revenue and a $0.9 million increase in logo revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2015.  
 Total operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $20.8 million to $218.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $197.8 million in the same period in 2015. The $20.8 million increase over the prior year is comprised of a $18.1 million increase in direct and general and administrative operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets and corporate expense increases of $2.7 million.  
 32 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.9 million, or 6.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30  , 2015, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired in the five new U.S. markets purchased in January 2016.   
 Due to the above factors, operating income increased to $119.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $111.6 million for the same period in 2015.  
 Interest expense increased $6.4 million from $24.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $31.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily resulting from the January 2016 issuance of the 5 3/4% Senior Notes.  
 The increase in operating income offset by the increase in interest expense resulted in a $1.7 million increase in income before income taxes. The Company recognized income tax expense of $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 4.1%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.  
 As a result of the above factors, the Company recognized net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $85.1 million, as compared to net income of $86.0 million for the same period in 2015.  
 Reconciliations:  
 Because acquisitions or dispositions occurring after December 31, 2014 (the  acquired assets ) have contributed to or reduced our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2015 net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
   
 Reconciliations of 2015 reported net revenue to 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the three months ended September 30, as well as a comparison of 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2016 reported net revenue for the three months ended September 30, are provided below:

Key Performance Indicators  
 Net Income/Adjusted EBITDA 
 (in thousands)    

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased 11.5% to $177.3 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense) of $26.7 million,  
 33 

and was partially offset by increases in general administrative and corporate expenses of $8.5 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.   
 Net Income/FFO/AFFO  
 (in thousands)  

FFO for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $130.9 million as compared to FFO of $123.5 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased 9.2% to $134.0 million as compared to $122.6 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense), partially offset by increases in general and administrative expense, corporate expense and interest expense. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
 Overview  
 The Company has historically satisfied its working capital requirements with cash from operations and borrowings under the senior credit facility. The Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Lamar Media Corp., is the borrower under the senior credit facility and maintains all corporate operating cash balances. Any cash requirements of the Company, therefore, must be funded by distributions from Lamar Media.  
 Sources of Cash  
 Total Liquidity.  As of September 30, 2016 we had approximately $222.4 million of total liquidity, which is comprised of approximately $37.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $184.9 million of availability under the revolving portion of Lamar Media s senior credit facility. We are currently in compliance with the maintenance covenant included in the senior credit facility and we would remain in compliance after giving effect to borrowing the full amount available to us under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility.   
 Cash Generated by Operations . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 our cash provided by operating activities was $337.8 million and $313.5 million, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period in 2015 primarily relates to an increase in revenues partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, (excluding depreciation and amortization).  We expect to generate cash flows from operations during 2016 in excess of our cash needs for operations, capital expenditures and dividends, as described herein.   
 Note Offerings.  On January 28, 2016, Lamar Media completed an institutional private placement of $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 5 3/4% Senior Notes. The institutional private placement resulted in net proceeds to Lamar Media, after payment of fees and expenses of approximately $394.5 million. Lamar Media used the proceeds of this offering to repay and retire the $300 million term A-1 loan, which it borrowed on January 7, 2016 in order to fund the acquisition of certain assets of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.   
 34 

On   September   1, 2016, Lamar Media   completed an   exchang  e   offer   for     all of its   then   outstanding 5 3/4% Senior Notes, which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for an equal principal amount of newly issued 5 3/4% Senior Notes that   were   so registered.  Lamar Media did not receive any   proceeds from the exchange offer.  
   
 Credit Facilities . On January 7, 2016, Lamar Media entered into Incremental Amendment No. 1 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of February 3, 2014 with the Company, certain of Lamar Media s subsidiaries as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto. The Incremental Amendment established a $300 million Term A-1 loan as a new class of incremental term loan. Lamar Media borrowed the $300 million in Term A-1 loans on January 7, 2016. The term A-1 loan was repaid in full and retired with the proceeds of the institutional private placement of 5  % Senior Notes on January 28, 2016. See   Sources of Cash-Note Offerings   for more information.   
 Lamar Media s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 3, 2014 (as amended, the  senior credit facility ) consists of a $400 million revolving credit facility and a $300 million Term A loan facility (the  Term A Loans ).  The Term A Loans were established on April 18, 2014 under Amendment No. 1 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  On March 4, 2016, Lamar Media entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which eliminated the previously existing $500 million cap on incremental loans with the result that Lamar Media may borrow incremental term and revolving loans under its senior credit facility without monetary limits, so long as Lamar Advertising s Senior Debt Ratio does not exceed 3.5 to 1.0.  Lamar Media is the borrower under the senior credit facility and may also from time to time designate wholly-owned subsidiaries as subsidiary borrowers under the incremental loan facility. Incremental loans may be in the form of additional term loan tranches or increases in the revolving credit facility. Our lenders have no obligation to make additional loans to us, or any designated subsidiary borrower, under the incremental facility, but may enter into such commitments in their sole discretion.  
 As of September 30, 2016, Lamar Media had approximately $184.9 million of availability under the revolving credit facility included in the senior credit facility and approximately $9.1 million in letters of credit outstanding. As of September 30, 2016, Lamar Media had approximately $258.8 million outstanding in Term A Loans and $206.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility. 
 Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity  
 Internally Generated Funds.  The key factors affecting internally generated cash flow are general economic conditions, specific economic conditions in the markets where the Company conducts its business and overall spending on advertising by advertisers.   
 Restrictions under Debt Securities.  Lamar Media must comply with certain covenants and restrictions related to its outstanding debt securities. Currently Lamar Media has outstanding $500 million 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes issued in February 2012 (the  5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes ), $535 million 5% Senior Subordinated Notes issued in October 2012 (the  5% Senior Subordinated Notes ), $510 million 5 3/8% Senior Notes issued in January 2014 (the  5 3/8% Senior Notes ) and the $400 million      5 3/4% Senior Notes issued January 2016.   
 The indentures relating to Lamar Media s outstanding notes restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit the incurrence of indebtedness (including indebtedness under the senior credit facility), (i) if no default or event of default would result from such incurrence and (ii) if after giving effect to any such incurrence, the leverage ratio (defined as the sum of (x) total consolidated debt plus (y) the aggregate liquidation preference of any preferred stock of Lamar Media s restricted subsidiaries to trailing four fiscal quarter EBITDA (as defined in the indentures)) would be less than 7.0 to 1. Currently, Lamar Media is not in default under the indentures of any of its outstanding notes and, therefore, would be permitted to incur additional indebtedness subject to the foregoing provision.  
 In addition to debt incurred under the provisions described in the preceding paragraph, the indentures relating to Lamar Media s outstanding notes permit Lamar Media to incur indebtedness pursuant to the following baskets:  

Up to $1.5 billion of indebtedness under the senior credit facility;     

Indebtedness outstanding on the date of the indentures or debt incurred to refinance outstanding debt;     

Inter-company debt between Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries or between restricted subsidiaries;     

Certain purchase money indebtedness and capitalized lease obligations to acquire or lease property in the ordinary course of business that cannot exceed the greater of $50 million or 5% of Lamar Media s net tangible assets; and     

Additional debt not to exceed $75 million.     

35 

Restrictions under Senior Credit Facility.    Lamar Media is required to comply with certain covenants and restrictions under the senior credit facility. If the Company or Lamar Media fails to comply with these te  sts, the lenders under the senior credit facility will be entitled to exercise certain remedies, including the termination of the lending commitments and the acceleration of the debt payments under the senior credit facility. At September 30, 2016, and cur  rently, we were in compliance with all such tests under the senior credit facility.   
 Lamar Media must maintain a senior debt ratio, defined as total consolidated debt (other than subordinated indebtedness) of Lamar Advertising and its restricted subsidiaries, minus the lesser of (x) $100 million and (y) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising and its restricted subsidiaries to EBITDA, as defined below, for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, of less than or equal to 3.5 to 1.0.  
 Lamar Media is also restricted from incurring additional indebtedness under certain circumstances unless, after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness, it is in compliance with the senior debt ratio covenant and its total debt ratio, defined as (a) total consolidated debt of Lamar Advertising and its restricted subsidiaries as of any date minus the lesser of (i) $100 million and (ii) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising and its restricted subsidiaries to (b) EBITDA, as defined below, for the most recent four fiscal quarters then ended is less than 6.0 to 1.0.  
 Under the senior credit facility  EBITDA  means, for any period, operating income for Lamar Advertising and its restricted subsidiaries (determined on a consolidated basis without duplication in accordance with GAAP) for such period (calculated before (i) taxes, (ii) interest expense, (iii) depreciation, (iv) amortization, (v) any other non-cash income or charges accrued for such period, (vi) charges and expenses in connection with the credit facility transactions, (vii) costs and expenses of Lamar Advertising associated with the REIT conversion, provided that the aggregate amount of costs and expenses that may be added back pursuant to this clause (vii) shall not exceed $10 million in the aggregate and (viii) the amount of cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies projected by Lamar Media in good faith to be realized as a result of any acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition within 12 months of any such acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition, net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such action: provided, (a) the aggregate amount for all such cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies shall not exceed an amount equal to 15% of EBITDA for the applicable four quarter period and (b) any such adjustment to EBITDA may only take into account cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements synergies that are (I) directly attributable to such acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition, (II) expected to have a continuing impact on Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries and (III) factually supportable, in each case all as certified by the chief financial officer of Lamar Media on behalf of  Lamar Media, and (ix) any loss or gain relating to amounts paid or earned in cash prior to the stated settlement date of any swap agreement that has been reflected in operating income for such period) and (except to the extent received or paid in cash by Lamar Advertising and its restricted subsidiaries, income or loss attributable to equity in affiliates for such period), excluding any extraordinary and unusual gains or losses during such period and excluding the proceeds of any casualty events whereby insurance or other proceeds are received and certain dispositions. For purposes of calculating EBITDA, the effect on such calculation of any adjustments required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R is excluded. If during any period for which EBITDA is being determined, Lamar Media shall have consummated any acquisition or disposition, EBITDA shall be determined on a pro forma basis as if such acquisition or disposition had been made or consummated on the first day of such period.  
 The Company believes that its current level of cash on hand, availability under the senior credit facility and future cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet its operating needs through fiscal 2016. All debt obligations are reflected on the Company s balance sheet.  
 Uses of Cash  
 Capital Expenditures.  Capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately $78.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We anticipate our 2016 total capital expenditures will be approximately $100 million.   
   
 Acquisitions.  On January 7, 2016, the Company acquired the assets in five U.S. markets from Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $458.5 million. The cash purchase price was funded using borrowings from the Company s revolving credit facility of $160 million and $300 million in borrowings under a Term A-1 incremental loan facility funded by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  The Term A-1 loan was subsequently repaid in full and retired on January 28, 2016 using the net proceeds from Lamar Media s issuance of $400 million in aggregate principal amount 5 3/4% Senior Notes. See   Sources of Cash-Note Offerings   for more information. A portion of the proceeds of the 5 3/4% Senior Notes were applied to prepay borrowings under the revolving credit facility.  
 The Company also completed seventeen additional acquisitions in the amount of $67.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which were financed using available cash on hand or borrowings under its revolving credit facility. 
 36 

Term A Loans.   The Term A Loans mature o  n February 2, 2019 and began amortizing on June 30, 2014. The remaining quarterly installments scheduled to be paid on each June 30, September 30, December 31 and March 31 is as follows:     

The Term A Loans bear interest at rates based on the Adjusted LIBO Rate ( Eurodollar loans ) or the Adjusted Base Rate ( Base Rate loans ), at Lamar Media s option. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 2.0%; (or the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 1.75% at any time the Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1). Base Rate Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Base Rate plus 1.00% (or the Adjusted Base Rate plus 0.75% at any time the Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1). The revolving credit facility bears interest at rates based on the Adjusted LIBO Rate ( Eurodollar loans ) or the Adjusted Base Rate ( Base Rate loans ), at Lamar Media s option. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 2.25% (or the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 2.00% at any time the Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 4.25 to 1; or the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 1.75% at any time the Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1). Base Rate Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Base Rate plus 1.25% (or the Adjusted Base Rate plus 1.0% at any time the total debt ratio is less than or equal to 4.25 to 1, or the Adjusted Base Rate plus 0.75% at any time the Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1). The guarantees, covenants, events of default and other terms of the senior credit facility apply to the Term A Loans and revolving credit facility.  
 Dividends.   On August 29, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.76 per share payable on September 30, 2016 to its stockholders of record of its Class A common stock and Class B common stock on September 16, 2016. The Company previously paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.75 per share on each of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  The Company expects aggregate quarterly distributions to stockholders in 2016, including the dividends paid on March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, will total $3.02 per common share.   
 As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company s control, including financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, the Company s ability to utilize net operating losses to offset, in whole or in part, the Company s distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its Taxable REIT Subsidiaries ( TRSs ) and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.  
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases.  
 Commitments and Contingencies  
 In our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2016, Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations, under the heading  Debt Service and Contractual Obligations,  we described our commitments and contingencies. There was no material change in our commitments and contingencies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Accounting Standards Update  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 deferring the effective date from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018, while allowing for early adoption as of January 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 
   
 37 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  .  The update is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabi  lities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about lease arrangements. The amendments in this update are effective beginning January 1, 2019 with retrospective application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update to dete  rmine the effect on its consolidated financial statements.  
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .   The update is designed to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this update will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The update clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows.  The update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update will have a material impact on its statement of cash flows. 
   
 LAMAR MEDIA CORP.  
 The following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Lamar Media for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Lamar Media and the related notes thereto.  
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
 Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 compared to Nine Months ended September 30, 2015  
 Net revenues increased $116.2 million or 11.6% to $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $997.4 million for the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $95.8 million, which represents an increase of 10.9% over the same period in 2015, primarily due to the integration of outdoor assets acquired since July 1, 2015, which included five new U.S. markets in January 2016 from Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and the addition of approximately 300 digital displays since October 1, 2015.   In addition, logo sign revenue increased $3.8 million, which represents an increase of 6.9% over the prior period and there was a $16.5 million increase in transit revenue, which represents an increase of 25.8% over the prior period, primarily due to the acquisition of Alliance Airports in July 2015. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was a $35.2 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which represents an increase of 3.3%. See  Reconciliations  below. The $35.2 million increase in revenue primarily consists of a $27.3 million increase in billboard revenue, a $5.2 million increase in transit revenue and a $2.7 million increase in logo revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2015.  
 Total operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $67.3 million to $649.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $581.8 million in the same period in 2015. The $67.3 million increase over the prior year is comprised of a $63.7 million increase in direct and general and administrative operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets and corporate expense increases of $3.6 million.  
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.3 million, or 5.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired in the five new U.S. markets purchased in January 2016. 
 Due to the above factors, operating income increased to $324.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $278.5 million for the same period in 2015.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a $3.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the prepayment of our Term A-1 loan under its senior credit facility.  
 38 

Interest expense increased $18.5 million from $74.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to $92.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2  016, primarily resulting from the January 2016 issuance of our   5 3/4% Senior Notes.  
 The increase in operating income offset by the increases in interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment resulted in a $23.7 million increase in income before income taxes. The Company recognized $9.7 million in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is approximately 4.3%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.  
 As a result of the above factors, we recognized net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $218.6 million, as compared to net income of $186.3 million for the same period in 2015.  
 Reconciliations:  
 Because acquisitions or dispositions occurring after December 31, 2014 (the  acquired assets ) have contributed to or reduced our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2015 net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Reconciliations of 2015 reported net revenue to 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, as well as a comparison of 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2016 reported net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, are provided below:  
 Reconciliation and Comparison of Reported Net Revenue to Acquisition-Adjusted Net Revenue    

Key Performance Indicators  
 Net Income/Adjusted EBITDA 
 (in thousands)  

Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 11.8% to $484.1 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense) of $73.8 million, and was partially offset by an increase in general administrative and corporate expense of $22.8 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.  
 39 

Net Income/FFO/AFFO   
 (in thousands)    

FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $349.3 million as compared to FFO of $312.7 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO for nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 12.7% to $360.3 million as compared to $319.8 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense), partially offset by increases in general and administrative expense, corporate expense and interest expense over the comparable period in 2015.  
   
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
 Three Months ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three Months ended September 30, 2015  
 Net revenues increased $36.8 million or 10.5% to $387.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $350.7 million for the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $34.1 million, which represents an increase of 11.1% over the same period in 2015, primarily due to the integration of outdoor assets acquired since July 1, 2015 which included the acquisition of five new U.S. markets in January 2016 from Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and the addition of approximately 300 digital displays since October 1, 2015, as well as an increase in political advertising sales.  In addition, logo sign revenue increased $1.2 million, which represents an increase of 6.7% over the prior period and there was a $1.5 million increase in transit revenue, which represents an increase of 5.7% over the prior period.  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, there was a $13.3 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015, which represents an increase of 3.6%. See  Reconciliations  below. The $13.3 million increase in revenue primarily consists of a $10.4 million increase in billboard revenue, a $2.1 million increase in transit revenue and a $0.9 million increase in logo revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2015.  
 Total operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $20.8 million to $218.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $197.7 million in the same period in 2015. The $20.8 million increase over the prior year is comprised of a $18.1 million increase in direct and general and administrative operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets and corporate expense increases of $2.7 million.  
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.9 million, or 6.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired in the five new U.S. markets purchased in January 2016.  
 40 

Due to the above factors, operating income increased to $119.9 million for the three months ended September   30, 2016 compared to $111.7 million for the same period in 2015.   
 Interest expense increased $6.4 million from $24.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $31.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily resulting from the January 2016 issuance of our 5 3/4% Senior Notes. 
 The increase in operating income offset by the increase in interest expense resulted in a $1.8 million increase in income before income taxes. We recognized income tax expense of $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 4.1%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.  
 As a result of the above factors, we recognized net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $85.2 million, as compared to net income of $86.0 million for the same period in 2015.  
 Reconciliations:  
 Because acquisitions or dispositions occurring after December 31, 2014 (the  acquired assets ) have contributed to or reduced our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2015 net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Reconciliations of 2015 reported net revenue to 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the three months ended September 30, as well as a comparison of 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2016 reported net revenue for the three months ended September 30, are provided below:

Key Performance Indicators  
 Net Income/Adjusted EBITDA 
 (in thousands)    

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased 11.5% to $177.4 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense) of $26.7 million, and was partially offset by increases in general administrative and corporate expenses of $8.2 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.  
 41 

Net Income/FF  O/AFFO   
 (in thousands)    

FFO for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $131.0 million as compared to FFO of $123.6 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased 9.2% to $134.1 million as compared to $122.7 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense), partially offset by increases in general and administrative expense, corporate expense and interest expense.

ITEM 3.   
 
            QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT  IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RI  SK      

 Lamar Advertising Company and Lamar Media Corp.  
 The Company is exposed to interest rate risk in connection with variable rate debt instruments issued by its wholly owned subsidiary Lamar Media. The information below summarizes the Company s interest rate risk associated with its principal variable rate debt instruments outstanding at September 30, 2016, and should be read in conjunction with Note 9 of the Notes to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Loans under Lamar Media s senior credit facility bear interest at variable rates equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate or Adjusted Base Rate plus the applicable margin. Because the Adjusted LIBO Rate or Adjusted Base Rate may increase or decrease at any time, the Company is exposed to market risk as a result of the impact that changes in these base rates may have on the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the senior credit facility. Increases in the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the senior credit facility would result in increased interest expense and a reduction in the Company s net income.  
 At September 30, 2016, there was approximately $464.8 million of aggregate indebtedness outstanding under the senior credit facility, or approximately 19.3% of the Company s outstanding long-term debt on that date, bearing interest at variable rates. The aggregate interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 with respect to borrowings under the senior credit facility was $10.1 million, and the weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under this credit facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 2.5%. Assuming that the weighted average interest rate was 200-basis points higher (that is 4.5% rather than 2.5%), then the Company s nine months ended September 30, 2016 interest expense would have increased by $7.8 million. 
 The Company attempted to mitigate the interest rate risk resulting from its variable interest rate long-term debt instruments by issuing fixed rate, long-term debt instruments and maintaining a balance over time between the amount of the Company s variable rate and fixed rate indebtedness. In addition, the Company has the capability under the senior credit facility to fix the interest rates applicable to its borrowings at an amount equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin for periods of up to twelve months (in certain cases with the consent of the lenders), which would allow the Company to mitigate the impact of short-term fluctuations in market interest rates. In the event of an increase in interest rates, the Company may take further actions to mitigate its exposure. The Company cannot guarantee, however, that the actions that it may take to mitigate this risk will be feasible or if these actions are taken, that they will be effective.

ITEM 4.   
 
          CONTROLS   AND PROCEDURES      

 a)  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   
 The Company s and Lamar Media s management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company and Lamar Media, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s and Lamar Media s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company and Lamar Media concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the Company s and Lamar Media s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods.  
 b)  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.   
 There was no change in the internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Company and Lamar Media identified in connection with the evaluation of the Company s and Lamar Media s internal control performed during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s and Lamar Media s internal control over financial reporting.
