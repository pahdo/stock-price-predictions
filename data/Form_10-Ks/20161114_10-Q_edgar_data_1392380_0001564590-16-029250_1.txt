 1. Nature of Business, Financial Condition and Basis of Presentation  
 Nature of Business . Gevo, Inc. ( Gevo  or the  Company,  which, unless otherwise indicated, refers to Gevo, Inc. and its subsidiaries) is a renewable chemicals and next generation biofuels company focused on the development and commercialization of alternatives to petroleum-based products with an emphasis on the production and sale of isobutanol and related products derived from renewable feedstocks. Gevo was incorporated in Delaware on June 9, 2005.   
 Gevo formed Gevo Development, LLC ( Gevo Development ) in September 2009 to finance and develop biorefineries either through joint venture, licensing arrangements, tolling arrangements or direct acquisition (see Note 9). Gevo Development became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in September 2010. Gevo Development purchased Agri-Energy, LLC ( Agri-Energy ) in September 2010.  
 Through May 2012, Agri-Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gevo Development, was engaged in the business of producing and selling ethanol and related products produced at its plant located in Luverne, Minnesota (the  Agri-Energy Facility ). The Company commenced the retrofit of the Agri-Energy Facility in 2011 and commenced initial startup operations for the production of isobutanol at this facility in May 2012. In September 2012, the Company made the strategic decision to pause isobutanol production at the Agri-Energy Facility to focus on optimizing specific parts of the process to further enhance isobutanol production rates.  
 In 2013, the Company modified the Agri-Energy Facility in order to increase the isobutanol production rate. In June 2013, the Company resumed the limited production of isobutanol at the Agri-Energy Facility, operating one fermenter and one Gevo Integrated Fermentation Technology  ( GIFT  ) separation system in order to (i) verify that the modifications had significantly reduced the previously identified infections, (ii) demonstrate that its biocatalyst performs in the one million liter fermenters at the Agri-Energy Facility, and (iii) confirm GIFT  efficacy at commercial scale at the Agri-Energy Facility. In August 2013, the Company expanded production capacity at the Agri-Energy Facility by adding a second fermenter and second GIFT  system to further verify its results with a second configuration of equipment. In October 2013, the Company began commissioning the Agri-Energy Facility on corn mash to test isobutanol production run rates and to optimize biocatalyst production, fermentation separation and water management systems.  
 In March 2014, the Company decided to leverage the flexibility of its GIFT  technology and further modify the Agri-Energy Facility to enable the simultaneous production of isobutanol and ethanol. In July 2014, the Company began more consistent co-production of isobutanol and ethanol at the Agri-Energy Facility, with one fermenter utilized for isobutanol production and three fermenters utilized for ethanol production.   In line with the Company s strategy to maximize asset utilization and site cash flows, this configuration of the plant was designed to allow the Company to continue to optimize its isobutanol technology at a commercial scale, while taking advantage of potentially favorable ethanol contribution margins. Also with a view to maximizing site cash flows, over certain periods of time, the Company operated the plant for the sole production of ethanol across all four fermenters.   
 In September 2015, the Company began deploying additional capital at the Agri-Energy Facility, primarily designed to decrease the cost of isobutanol production by insourcing parts of the process that had previously been done off-site by third parties. This required the cessation of isobutanol production while this equipment was being installed. In March 2016, the Company completed these capital projects and reestablished isobutanol production in one fermenter. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company s business activities were focused on the following areas:  optimizing the co-production of isobutanol, ethanol and related products at the Agri-Energy Facility; research and development; business development; business and financial planning; and raising capital.  Ultimately, the Company believes that the attainment of profitable operations is dependent upon future events, including completion of its development activities resulting in commercial production and sales of isobutanol or isobutanol-derived products and/or technology, obtaining adequate financing to repay or refinance its debt and complete its development activities and build out further isobutanol production capacity, gaining market acceptance and demand for its products and services, and attracting and retaining qualified personnel.  
 The Company has primarily derived revenue from the sale of ethanol, distiller s grains and other related products produced as part of the ethanol production process at the Agri-Energy Facility. The production of ethanol alone is not the Company s intended business and its future strategy is expected to depend on its ability to produce and market isobutanol and products derived from isobutanol. The Company is only beginning to achieve more consistent production and revenue from the sale of isobutanol, therefore, the historical operating results of the Company may not be indicative of future operating results for Agri-Energy or Gevo.

 GEVO, INC.    Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  
   
  Financial Conditi  on  . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred a consolidated net loss of $34.9 million and $28.2 million, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $374.4 million at September 30, 2016.  The Company s cash and cash e  quivalents at September 30, 2016 totaled $31.1 million which will be used for the following: (i) operating activities of the Agri-Energy Facility; (ii) operating activities at the Company s corporate headquarters in Colorado, including research and develop  ment work; (iii) capital improvements primarily associated with the Agri-Energy Facility; (iv) costs associated with optimizing isobutanol production technology; (v) exploration of restructuring, strategic alternatives and new financings; and (vi) debt ser  vice  and repayment obligations.   
 The Company expects to incur future net losses as it continues to fund the development and commercialization of its product candidates. To date, the Company has financed its operations primarily with proceeds from multiple sales of equity and debt securities, borrowings under debt facilities and product sales.  While existing working capital at September 30, 2016 was sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund planned operations through December 31, 2016, it is not sufficient to satisfy all of the Company s debt obligations expected to become due and payable in 2017.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s inability to continue as a going concern may potentially affect its rights and obligations under its debt obligations and may lead to bankruptcy.     
 The Company s t ransition to profitability is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional capital, repaying or refinancing its debt, the successful development and commercialization of its products and product candidates, the achievement of a level of revenue adequate to support the Company s existing cost st ructure and the repayment or restructuring of the Company s debt obligations. The Company may never achieve profitability or generate positive cash flows, and unless and until it does, the Company will continue to need to raise additional capital. Management intends to fund future operations through additional private and/or public offerings of debt or equity securities.  In addition, the Company may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources, may seek to restructure its debt and will continue to address its cost structure. The Company intends to continue to explore various financing alternatives to improve its capital structure, including reducing debt and extending maturities.  These efforts may include investments from a strategic partner, new equity or debt financings or exchange offers with the Company s existing debt holders (including exchanges of debt for debt or equity securities) and other transactions involving the Company s outstanding debt securities.  Notwithstanding, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds, or achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from operations. 
 Although substantial doubts exist about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Company s assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.      
 Basis of Presentation.  The unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company (which include the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries Gevo Development and Agri-Energy) have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. for complete financial statements. These statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company at September 30, 2016 and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included under the heading  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in Part II, Item 8 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  Annual Report ).     
 Reverse Stock Split.   On April 15, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a reverse split of the Company s common stock, par value $0.01, at a ratio of one-for-fifteen.   This reverse stock split became effective on April 20, 2015 and, unless otherwise indicated, all share amounts, per share data, share prices, exercise prices and conversion rates set forth in these notes and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have, where applicable, been adjusted retroactively to reflect this reverse stock split.

 GEVO, INC.    Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements.    In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Cu  stomers   ( ASU 2014   09 ).   The objective of ASU 2014-09 is to outline a new, single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis for determining wh  en and how revenue is recognized, depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014     09 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is not permitted.    On July 9, 2015, the FASB voted to delay the implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year to December 15, 2017.  In A  pril 2016, the FASB issued   Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ( ASU 2016-10 ) which provides additional clarification regarding   Identifying Performance Obligation  s and Licensing  .  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014   09 and ASU 2016-10.     
 In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ).  The objective of ASU 2014-15 is to provide guidance in GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.  ASU 2015-15 requires a management evaluation about whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. In doing so, ASU 2014-15 should reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures.  ASU 2014   15 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-15. 
   
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ("ASU 2015-11") which requires an entity to measure in scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. The amendments do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2015-11 on its consolidated balance sheets. 
   
 In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ) which clarifies cash flow statement classification of eight specific cash flow issues. The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to provide clarification and consistency for classifying the eight specific cash flow issues because current GAAP either is unclear or does not include specific guidance.  The amendments in the update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated balance sheets. 
   
 Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements .  In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03    Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 ) intended to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. These amendments require that debt issuance   costs be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liabilities, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. This will result in the elimination of debt issuance costs as an asset and will reduce the carrying value of the Company s debt liabilities. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company has adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2016.   The adoption of this guidance had an immaterial impact on our financial position and has resulted in the following retrospective adjustments to our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):

  2. Earnings per Share   
 Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to Gevo common stockholders for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share ( EPS ) includes the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents and is computed using the weighted-average number of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 excluded common stock equivalents because the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, or would decrease the reported loss per share.  
 The following table sets forth securities outstanding that could potentially dilute the calculation of diluted earnings per share.  

3. Inventories  
 The following table sets forth the components of the Company s inventory balances (in thousands).

 In May 2016, certain assets of the Agri-Energy retrofit asset were reclassified from plant, machinery and equipment to the Agri-Energy retrofit asset.    

 Included in cost of goods sold is depreciation of $4.5 million and $4.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      
 Included in operating expenses is depreciation of $0.6 million and $0.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.     

5. Embedded Derivatives  
 Convertible 2022 Notes  
 In July 2012, the Company issued 7.5% convertible senior notes due July 2022 (the  2022 Notes ) which contain the following embedded derivatives: (i) rights to convert into shares of the Company s common stock, including upon a Fundamental Change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Notes (the  Indenture )); and (ii) a Coupon Make-Whole Payment (as defined in the Indenture) in the event of a conversion by the holders of the 2022 Notes prior to July 1, 2017. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract, the 2022 Notes, and carried at fair value when: (a) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract; and (b) a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument. The Company has concluded that the embedded derivatives within the 2022 Notes meet these criteria and, as such, must be valued separate and apart from the 2022 Notes as one embedded derivative and recorded at fair value each reporting period.  
 The Company used a binomial lattice model in order to estimate the fair value of the embedded derivative in the 2022 Notes. A binomial lattice model generates two probable outcomes, whether up or down, arising at each point in time, starting from the date of valuation until the maturity date. A lattice was initially used to determine if the 2022 Notes would be converted, called or held at each decision point. Within the lattice model, the following assumptions are made: (i) the 2022 Notes will be converted early if the conversion value is greater than the holding value; or (ii) the 2022 Notes will be called if the holding value is greater than both (a) the Redemption Price (as defined in the Indenture) and (b) the conversion value plus the Coupon Make-Whole Payment at the time. If the 2022 Notes are called, then the holders will maximize their value by finding the optimal decision between (1) redeeming at the Redemption Price and (2) converting the 2022 Notes.  
 Using this lattice model, the Company valued the embedded derivative using a  with-and-without method , where the value of the 2022 Notes including the embedded derivative is defined as the  with , and the value of the 2022 Notes excluding the embedded derivative is defined as the  without . This method estimates the value of the embedded derivative by looking at the difference in the values between the 2022 Notes with the embedded derivative and the value of the 2022 Notes without the embedded derivative. The lattice model requires the following inputs: (i) price of Gevo common stock; (ii) Conversion Rate (as defined in the Indenture); (iii) Conversion Price (as defined in the Indenture); (iv) maturity date; (v) risk-free interest rate; (vi) estimated stock volatility; and (vii) estimated credit spread for the Company.  
 12 
 
 GEVO, INC.    Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  
   
  Inputs used to estimate the value of the embedded derivative as of December 31, 2015 determined the value of the embedded derivatives to be zero. Changes in certain inputs   into the lattice model can have a significant impact on changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives. For example, the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives will generally decrease with: (i) a decline in the stock price; (ii)   a decrease in the estimated stock volatility; and (iii) a decrease in the estimated credit spread.  During the period ended September 30, 2016, factors that could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives indicate th  e value to remain at zero.  
 Derivative Warrant Liability  
 In December 2013, the Company sold warrants to purchase 1,420,250 shares of the Company s common stock (the  2013 Warrants ). In August 2014, the Company sold warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock (the  2014 Warrants ). In February 2015, the Company sold Series A warrants to purchase 2,216,667 shares of the Company s common stock (the  Series A Warrants ) and Series B warrants to purchase 2,216,667 shares of the Company s common stock (the  Series B Warrants ). In May 2015, the Company sold Series C warrants to purchase 430,000 shares of the Company s common stock (the  Series C Warrants ).

 The following table sets forth information pertaining to shares issued upon the exercise of such warrants as of September 30, 2016: 

(1)   
 
 The exercise price is $0.55 but $0.54 of the exercise price was pre-funded upon issuance of the Series J Warrants.  The warrants were fully exercised at September 30, 2016.    

The agreements governing the above warrants include the following terms:  

certain warrants have exercise prices which are subject to adjustment for certain events, including the issuance of stock dividends on the Company s common stock and, in certain instances, the issuance of the Company s common stock or instruments  convertible into the Company s common stock at a price per share less than the exercise price of the respective warrants;

 GEVO, INC.    Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  

warrant holders may exercise the warrants through a cashless exercise if, and only if, the Company does not have an effective registration statement then available for the issuance o  f the shares of its common stock. If an effective registration statement is available for the issuance of its common stock a holder may only exercise the warrants through a cash exercise;      

the exercise price and the number and type of securities purchasable upon exercise of  the warrants are subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events, including certain combinations, consolidations, liquidations, mergers, recapitalizations, reclassifications, reorganizations, stock dividends and stock splits, a sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets and certain other events; and      

in the event of an  extraordinary transaction  or a  fundamental transaction  (as such terms are defined in the respective warrant agreements), generally including any merger with or into another entity, sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets, tender offer or exchange offer, or reclassification of its common stock, in which the successor entity (as defined in the respective warrant agreements) that assumes the successor entity is not a publicly traded company, the Company or any successor entity will pay the warrant holder, at such holder s option, exercisable at any time concurrently with or within 30 days after the consummation of the extraordinary transaction or fundamental transaction, an amount of cash equal to the value of such holder s warrants as determined in accordance with the Black Scholes option pricing model and the terms of the respective warrant agreement.  In some circumstances, the Company or successor entity may be obligated to make such payments regardless of whether the successor entity that assumes the warrants is a publicly traded company.     

   Based on these terms, the Company has determined that the 2013 Warrants, the 2014 Warrants, the Series A Warrants, the Series C Warrants, the Series D Warrants, the Series F Warrants, the Series H Warrants and the Series I Warrants (together, the  Warrants ) qualify as derivatives and, as such, are presented as derivative warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheets and recorded at fair value each reporting period. The fair value of the Warrants was estimated to be $10.7 million and $10.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The increase in the estimated fair   value of the Warrants is the result of exercises of warrants during the period offset by the issuance of new warrants during the period.   
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 51,151,312 shares of common stock as a result of the exercise of Series A, D, E, G, H and J Warrants.  The Company received proceeds of $10.9 million from such exercises.  
 In May 2016, as permitted by Section 2(a) of the Series H Warrant agreement, the board of directors of the Company approved a voluntary reduction of the exercise price for 7.5 million of the outstanding Series H Warrants, from an exercise price of $0.75 per share of common stock to $0.30 per share of common stock, for the remaining term of these warrants. Except for the reduction in exercise price, the terms of these Series H Warrants remain unchanged. 
 In June 2016, as permitted by Section 2(a) of the Series H Warrant agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a voluntary reduction of the exercise price for 3.0 million of the outstanding Series H Warrants, from an exercise price of $0.75 per share of common stock to $0.42 per share of common stock, for the remaining term of these warrants. The board of directors of the Company also approved a voluntary reduction of the exercise price for 2.0 million of the outstanding Series H Warrants, from an exercise price of $0.75 per share of common stock to $0.52 per share of common stock, for the remaining term of these warrants. Ultimately, the Company adjusted the exercise price to $0.52 per share of common stock for only 1.0 million of the Series H Warrants. Except for the reduction in exercise price, the terms of these Series H Warrants remain unchanged. 
 In June 2016, as permitted by Section 9 of the Series D Warrant agreement, the Company agreed with certain holders of the Series D Warrants to the amend the exercise price and accelerate the initial exercise date for 4,167,391 of the outstanding Series D Warrants held by such holders. Pursuant to that amendment, with respect to 4,167,391 of the outstanding Series D Warrants held by those holders, the exercise price was increased from an exercise price of $0.10 per share of common stock to $0.175 per share of common stock, for the remaining term of these warrants and the initial exercise date was changed from June 11, 2016 to June 8, 2016. Except for the change in exercise price and the initial exercise date, the terms of these Series D Warrants remained unchanged.  
 As of September 30, 2016, all of the Series H Warrants and Series D Warrants for which the exercise price had been adjusted were fully exercised.

7. Senior Secured Debt, Secured Debt and 2022 Notes  
 Senior Secured Debt  
 In May 2014, the Company entered into a term loan agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with the lenders party thereto from time to time (each, a  Lender  and collectively, the  Lenders ) and Whitebox Advisors, LLC, as administrative agent for the Lenders ( Whitebox ), with a maturity date of March 15, 2017, pursuant to which the Lenders committed to provide one or more senior secured term loans to the Company in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $31.1 million on the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement (collectively, the  Term Loan ). The first advance of the Term Loan in the amount of $22.8 million (the  First Advance ), net of discounts and issue costs of $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, was made to the Company in May 2014. Also in May 2014, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into an Exchange and Purchase Agreement (the  Exchange and Purchase Agreement ) with WB Gevo, Ltd. and the other Lenders and Whitebox, in its capacity as administrative agent for the Lenders. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange and Purchase Agreement, the Lenders were given the right, subject to certain conditions, to exchange all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan for the Company s 2017 Notes (as defined below), which are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock.   While outstanding, the Term Loan bore an interest rate equal to 15% per annum, of which 5% was payable in cash and 10% was payable in kind and capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Term Loan.  
 In June 2014, the Lenders exchanged $25.9 million, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan provided in the First Advance for 10% convertible senior secured notes due 2017 (the  2017 Notes ), together with accrued paid-in-kind interest of $0.2 million. The terms of the 2017 Notes are set forth in an indenture by and among the Company, its subsidiaries in their capacity as guarantors, and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as trustee (the  2017 Notes Indenture ). The 2017 Notes will mature on March 15, 2017. The 2017 Notes have a conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) equal to $17.38 per share, or 0.0576 shares per $1 principal amount of 2017 Notes. Optional prepayment of the 2017 Notes is not permitted. The 2017 Notes bear interest at a rate equal to 10% per annum, which is payable 5% in cash and, under certain circumstances, 5% in kind and capitalized and added to the principal amount of the 2017 Notes. While the 2017 Notes are outstanding, the Company is required to maintain an interest reserve in an amount equal to 10% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount, to be adjusted on an annual basis. As of September 30, 2016, there was a balance of $2.6 million in the interest reserve account. This amount is classified as restricted deposits.

  The 2017 Notes Indenture contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for agreements of this type and events of default, including, restrictions on disposing of certain assets, granting or otherwise al  lowing the imposition of a lien against certain assets, incurring certain amounts of additional indebtedness, making investments, acquiring or merging with another entity, and making dividends and other restricted payments, unless the Company receives the   prior approval of the required holders. The 2017 Notes Indenture also contains limitations on the ability of the holder to assign or otherwise transfer its interest in the 2017 Notes.  The 2017 Notes are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets   of the Company and are guaranteed by Agri-Energy and Gevo Development (together, the  Guarantors ). On June 6, 2014, in connection with the issuance of the 2017 Notes, the Company and the Guarantors entered into a pledge and security agreement in favor of   the collateral trustee. The collateral pledged includes substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, including intellectual property and real property.  Agri-Energy has also entered into a mortgage with respect to the real property l  ocated in Luverne Minnesota.   
 The holders of the 2017 Notes may, at any time until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, convert the principal amount of the 2017 Notes, or any portion of such principal amount which is at least $1,000, into shares of the Company s common stock. Upon conversion of the 2017 Notes, the Company will deliver shares of common stock at the Conversion Rate of 0.0576 shares of common stock per $1.00 principal amount of the 2017 Notes (equivalent to the Conversion Price of approximately $17.38 per share of common stock). Such Conversion Rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including in the event that there is a dividend or distribution paid on shares of the common stock or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the common stock. The Company also has the right to increase the Conversion Rate (i) by any amount for a period of at least 20 business days if the Company s board of directors determines that such increase would be in the Company s best interest or (ii) to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of shares of common stock or rights to purchase shares of common stock in connection with any dividend or distribution. In addition, subject to certain conditions described herein, each holder who exercises its option to voluntarily convert its 2017 Notes will receive a make-whole payment in an amount equal to any unpaid interest that would otherwise have been payable on such 2017 Notes through the maturity date (a  Voluntary Conversion Make-Whole Payment ). Subject to certain limitations, the Company may pay any Voluntary Conversion Make-Whole Payments either in cash or in shares of common stock, at its election.  
 The Company has the right to require holders of the 2017 Notes to convert all or part of the 2017 Notes into shares of its common stock if the last reported sales price of the common stock over any 10 consecutive trading days equals or exceeds 150% of the applicable Conversion Price (a  Mandatory Conversion ). Each holder whose 2017 Notes are converted in a Mandatory Conversion will receive a make-whole payment for the converted notes in an amount equal to any unpaid interest that would have otherwise been payable on such 2017 Notes through the maturity date (a  Mandatory Conversion Make-Whole Payment ). Subject to certain limitations, the Company may pay any Mandatory Conversion Make-Whole Payments either in cash or in shares of common stock, at its election. The Company did not require any holders to convert in 2015 and has not required any holders to convert through the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 If a fundamental change of the Company occurs, the holders of the 2017 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2017 Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2017 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through, but excluding, the repurchase date, plus a cash make-whole payment for the repurchased 2017 Notes in an amount equal to any unpaid interest that would otherwise have been payable on such convertible 2017 Notes through the maturity date. A fundamental change includes, among other things, the Company s common stock ceasing to be listed on a national securities exchange.  
 On July 31, 2014, January 28, 2015, May 13, 2015, November 12, 2015, December 7, 2015 March 28, 2016 and September 7, 2016, the Company entered into amendments to the  2017 Notes Indenture  to, among other things, permit the offering and issuance of additional warrants and the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company under such additional warrants. In connection with the November 12, 2015 amendments, the Company did not issue any warrants or incur any indebtedness. 
 On June 1, 2015, the Company entered into further amendments to the 2017 Notes Indenture to, among other things, permit (i) the execution, delivery, and performance of the FCStone Agreements (as defined below) and the related Guaranty (as defined below), (ii) the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company and Agri-Energy pursuant thereto and (iii) the making of the investments by the Company and Agri-Energy thereunder. 
 On August 22, 2015, the Company entered into further amendments to the 2017 Notes Indenture to, among other things, permit (i) the execution, delivery, and performance of the License Agreement (as defined below) and (ii) the exchange of all or any portion of  the 2022 Notes for common stock issued by the Company.

  In connection with the transactions described above, the Company also entere  d into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated May 9, 2014 (the  Registration Rights Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 registering the resale of approximately 1.2 million shares of the Company s common sto  ck which are issuable under the 2017 Notes. This registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on July 25, 2014.   
 The Company has elected the fair value option for accounting for the 2017 Notes in order for management to mitigate income statement volatility caused by measurement basis differences between the embedded instruments and to eliminate complexities of applying certain accounting models. Accordingly, the principal amount of 2017 Notes outstanding at September 30, 2016 of $26.1 million has been recorded at its estimated fair value of $25.2 million and is included in the 2017 Notes recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2016. Debt issuance costs of $1.5 million were expensed at issuance and a gain of $3.6 million has been recognized in subsequent periods in connection with the election of the fair value option.  Change in the estimated fair value of the 2017 Notes represents an unrealized gain included in gain (loss) from change in fair value of 2017 Notes in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the 2017 Notes at the issuance date was equal to the net proceeds from the loan.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred cash interest expense of $3.2 million.  
 The following table sets forth the inputs to the lattice model that were used to value the 2017 Notes for which the fair value option was elected.   

The following table sets forth information pertaining to the 2017 Notes which is included in the Company s consolidated balance sheets (in thousands).  

Changes in certain inputs into the lattice model can have a significant impact on changes in the estimated fair value of the 2017 Notes. For example, the estimated fair value will generally decrease with: (1) a decline in the stock price; (2) decreases in the estimated stock volatility; and (3) a decrease in the estimated credit spread. The change in the estimated fair value of the 2017 Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, represents an unrealized loss which has been recorded as a loss from change in fair value of 2017 Notes in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Amended Agri-Energy Loan Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for agreements of this type.  In October 2011, Agri-Energy borrowed $10.0 million under the additional term loan facilities which originally matured in October 2015. In January 2012, Agri-Energy borrowed an additional $5.0 million under the additional term loan facilities which originally matured in December 2015, bringing the total amount borrowed under the additional term loan facilities to $15.0 million.

 GEVO, INC.    Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  
   
  In July 2012, the Company sold $45.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes, with net proceeds of $40.9 million, after accounting for $2.7 million and $1.4   million of discounts and issue costs, respectively. The 2022 Notes bear interest at 7.5% which is to be paid semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year. The 2022 Notes will mature on July 1, 2022, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or   converted. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the Company recorded $2.2 million and $1.7 million of expense related to the amortization of debt discounts and issue costs; zero      and $1.0 million of expense related to th  e conversion of debt; and $0.8 million and $0.9 million of interest expense related to the 2022 Notes. The amortization of debt issue costs, debt discounts and cash interest are included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of   operations. The Company amortizes debt discounts and debt issue costs associated with the 2022 Notes using an effective interest rate of 40% from the issuance date through July 1, 2017, a five-year period, which represents the date the holders can require   the Company to repurchase the 2022 Notes.  
 The 2022 Notes are convertible at a conversion rate of 11.7113 shares of the Company s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances as described in the Indenture. This is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $85.35 per share of common stock. Holders may convert the 2022 Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the third business day immediately preceding the maturity date of July 1, 2022.  
 If a holder elects to convert its 2022 Notes prior to July 1, 2017, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the consideration upon conversion, a Coupon Make-Whole Payment. The Coupon Make-Whole Payment is equal to the sum of the present values of the number of semi-annual interest payments that would have been payable on the 2022 Notes that a holder has elected to convert from the last day through which interest was paid up to but excluding July 1, 2017, computed using a discount rate of 2%. The Company may pay any Coupon Make-Whole Payment either in cash or in shares of common stock at its election.  If the Company elects to pay in common stock, the stock will be valued at 90% of the average of the daily volume weighted average prices of the Company s common stock for the 10 trading days preceding the date of conversion. 
   
 In September 2016, the Company issued 13,999,354 shares of common stock in exchange for the redemption of $11.4 million of the 2022 Notes. The net loss on the extinguishment of the 2022 Notes was $0.9 million.   
   
 In November 2015, the Company issued 1,107,833 shares of common stock in exchange for the redemption of $2.5 million of the 2022 Notes.      The net loss on the extinguishment of the 2022 Notes was $0.05 million.  
 In February 2015, the Company issued 170,042 shares of common stock to convert $2.0 million of the 2022 Notes. The net gain on the extinguishment of the 2022 Notes was $0.3 million.   
 If a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occurs and a holder elects to convert its 2022 Notes prior to July 1, 2017, the Conversion Rate will increase based upon reference to the table set forth in Schedule A of the Indenture. In no event will the Conversion Rate increase to more than 13.4680 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Notes.  
 If a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occurs at any time, then each holder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all of such holder s 2022 Notes, or any portion thereof that is an integral multiple of $1,000 principal amount, for cash at a repurchase price of 100% of the principal amount of such 2022 Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon through, but excluding, the repurchase date.  Additionally, on July 1, 2017, each holder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all of such holder s 2022 Notes, or any portion thereof that is an integral multiple of $1,000 principal amount, for cash at a repurchase price of 100% of the principal amount of such 2022 Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon through, but excluding, the repurchase date.

12. Fair Value Measurements  
 Accounting standards define fair value, outline a framework for measuring fair value, and detail the required disclosures about fair value measurements. Under these standards, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or most advantageous market. Standards establish a hierarchy in determining the fair market value of an asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy has three levels of inputs, both observable and unobservable. Standards require the utilization of the highest possible level of input to determine fair value.  
 Level 1   inputs include quoted market prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.  
 Level 2   inputs are market data, other than Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted market prices in an inactive market, and other observable information that can be corroborated by market data.  
 Level 3   inputs are unobservable and corroborated by little or no market data.  
 Inventories.  The Company records its inventory, primarily corn inventory, at fair value only when the Company s cost of corn purchased exceeds the market value for corn. The Company determines the market value of corn based upon Level 1 inputs using quoted market prices. The Company incurred a write-down of inventory of $0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The Company incurred no write-down of inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
 Secured Debt . The Company has estimated the fair value of its secured debt obligations based upon discounted cash flows with Level 3 inputs, such as the terms that management believes would currently be available to the Company for similar issues of debt, taking into account the current credit risk of the Company and other market factors.    
 2017 Notes.   The Company has estimated the fair value of the 2017 Notes to be $25.2 million and $21.6 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, based upon Level 2 inputs, including the market price of the Company s common stock.  The Company has valued the 2017 Notes and all of its components using the fair value option as there are no embedded instruments which qualify for equity presentation.  See Note 7 for the fair value inputs used to estimate the fair value of the 2017 Notes.   
 2022 Notes Embedded Derivative . The Company has estimated the fair value of the 2022 Notes, including the embedded derivative, to be $8.8 million and $14.3 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, based upon Level 2 inputs, including the market price of the 2022 Notes derived from actual trades of the 2022 Notes. The Company has estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative on a stand-alone basis to be zero at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, based upon Level 2 inputs. See Note 5 above for the fair value inputs used to estimate the fair value of the 2022 Notes with and without the embedded derivative and the fair value of the embedded derivative.

As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of the Series A Warrants was $0.9 million and $0.1 million respectively based upon Level 3 inputs utilizing a Monte-Carlo simulation model. 
 In February 2015, the Company issued Series B Warrants to purchase 2,216,667 shares of the Company s common stock.  Based on the terms of the Series B Warrants, the Company determined that the Series B Warrants qualify as a derivative and, as such, are presented as a derivative warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheets and recorded at fair value each reporting period. The Company determined the estimated fair value of the Series B Warrants at the issuance date of February 3, 2015 to be $2.5 million based upon Level 3 inputs.     The Series B Warrants expired on August 3, 2015. 
 In May 2015, the Company issued Series C Warrants to purchase 430,000 shares of the Company s common stock.  Based on the terms of the Series C Warrants, the Company determined that the Series C Warrants qualify as a derivative and, as such, are presented as derivative warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheets and recorded at fair value each reporting period. The Company determined the estimated fair value of the Series C Warrants at the issuance date of May 19, 2015 to be $1.2 million.   As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the estimated fair value was $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively based upon Level 3 inputs utilizing an analysis of actual historical market trades of the Series C Warrants and the Black Scholes model. The Company relied on Level 3 inputs for estimating the fair value of the Series C Warrants as of May 19, 2015, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 due to the lack of market trades of the Series C Warrants. 
 In December 2015, the Company issued 10,050,000 Series D Warrants and 8,000,000 Series E Warrants. Based on the terms of the Series D Warrants and Series E Warrants, the Company determined that the each of the Series D Warrants and Series E Warrants qualify as a derivative and, as such, are presented as derivative warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheets and recorded at fair value each reporting period. The Company determined the estimated fair value of the Series D Warrants to be $5.7 million as of the issuance date, $0.01 million as of December 31, 2015 and $0.01 million as of September 30, 2016 utilizing a Black Scholes model.  The Company relied on Level 1 inputs of the market price for estimating the fair value of the Series E Warrants, and determined the fair value to be $5.3 million as of the issuance date, $4.0 million as of December 31, 2015, and were fully exercised   as of September 30, 2016.  
 In April 2016, the Company issued 10,292,858 Series F Warrants, 6,571,429 Series G Warrants, and 20,585,716 Series H Warrants.  Based on the terms of the Series F Warrants, Series G Warrants and the Series H Warrants, the Company determined that each of the Series F Warrants, Series G Warrants and Series H Warrants qualify as a derivative and, as such, are presented as derivative warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheets and recorded at fair value each reporting period.  The Company relied on Level 3 inputs for estimating the fair value of the Series F warrants and utilized a Monte Carlo simulation and determined the estimated fair value to be $2.2 million as of the April 1, 2016 issuance date. The Company relied on Level 3 inputs for estimating the fair value of the Series H warrants and utilized a Black Scholes model and determined the estimated fair value to be $2.1 million as of the April 1, 2016 issuance date.   The Company relied on Level 1 inputs for estimating the fair value of the Series G warrants and determined the estimated fair value to be $1.6 million as of the April 1, 2016 issuance date.  The Series F and H warrants were determined to have an estimated fair value of $4.6 million and $0.0 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2016.  The Series G warrants were fully exercised and no longer outstanding as of September 30, 2016.

 GEVO, INC.    Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  
   
  In September 2016, the Company issued 14,250,000 Series I Warrants, and 3,700,000 Series J Warrants.  Based on the terms o  f the Series I Warrants and the Series J Warrants, the Company determined that each of the Series I Warrants and Series J Warrants qualify as a derivative and, as such, are presented as derivative warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheets and re  corded at fair value each reporting period.  The Company relied on Level 3 inputs for estimating the fair value of the Series I Warrants and utilized a Black Scholes model and determined the estimated fair value to be $5.7 million as of the September 13, 2  016 issuance date. The Company relied on Level 1 inputs for estimating the fair value of the Series J Warrants and determined the estimated fair value to be $1.8 million as of the September 13, 2016 issuance date.  Series I Warrants were determined to have   an estimated fair value of $5.6 million as of September 30, 2016.  The Series J Warrants were fully exercised and no longer outstanding as of September 30, 2016.    
 While the Company believes that its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, it recognizes that the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.

 Company Overview  
 We are a renewable chemicals and next generation biofuels company.  We have developed proprietary technology that uses a combination of synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering to focus primarily on the production of isobutanol, as well as related products from renewable feedstocks. Isobutanol is a four-carbon alcohol that can be sold directly for use as a specialty chemical in the production of solvents, paints and coatings or as a value-added gasoline blendstock. Isobutanol can also be converted into butenes using dehydration chemistry deployed in the refining and petrochemicals industries today. The convertibility of isobutanol into butenes is important because butenes are primary hydrocarbon building blocks used in the production of hydrocarbon fuels, lubricants, polyester, rubber, plastics, fibers and other polymers.  We believe that the products derived from isobutanol have potential applications in substantially all of the global hydrocarbon fuels markets and in approximately 40% of the global petrochemicals markets.  
 In order to produce and sell isobutanol made from renewable sources, we have developed the Gevo Integrated Fermentation Technology      ( GIFT      ), an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of renewable isobutanol. GIFT  consists of two components, proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation, and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol during the fermentation process. We developed our technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately 25 billion gallons per year of global operating ethanol production capacity, as estimated by the Renewable Fuels Association.  
 GIFT  is designed to permit (i) the retrofit of existing ethanol capacity to produce isobutanol, ethanol or both products simultaneously, or (ii) the addition of renewable isobutanol or ethanol production capabilities to a facility s existing ethanol production by adding additional fermentation capacity side-by-side with the facility s existing ethanol fermentation capacity (collectively referred to as  Retrofit ). Having the flexibility to switch between the production of isobutanol and ethanol, or produce both products simultaneously, is expected to allow us to optimize asset utilization and cash flows at a facility by taking advantage of fluctuations in market conditions. GIFT      is also designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure Retrofits of existing ethanol facilities, enabling a potentially rapid route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks. We believe that our production route will be cost-efficient and will enable rapid deployment of our technology platform and allow our isobutanol and related renewable products to be economically competitive with many of the petroleum-based products used in the chemicals and fuels markets today.

2016 Highlights and Developments  

On November 14, 2016, Alaska Airline is expected to fly the first commercial flight with Gevo s cellulosic Alcohol-to-Jet fuel ( ATJ ). Previously, o  n October 11, 2016, we announced that we had completed production of the world s first cellulosic renewable jet fuel that is specified for commercial flights.  We successfully adapted our patented technologies to convert cellulosic sugars derived from wood waste into renewable isobutanol, which was then further converted into our ATJ fuel. This ATJ fuel meets the ASTM D7566 specification allowing it to be used for commercial flights. We produced over 1,000 gallons of the cellulosic ATJ fuel.  The November 14, 2016, flight follows on the back of the two commercial flights that were flown by Alaska Airlines on Gevo s ATJ fuel in June of this year.  The ATJ fuel for the June flights was derived from isobutanol produced at the Luverne Plant using sustainable corn as the sugar feedstock. The cellulosic ATJ fuel was produced in conjunction with the Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance ( NARA ). NARA supplied the sugars that were derived from forest residuals in the Pacific Northwest. We produced the cellulosic renewable isobutanol in St. Joseph, Missouri.  The cellulosic renewable isobutanol was then transported to our biorefinery facility in Silsbee, Texas, where the cellulosic renewable isobutanol was converted into ATJ fuel.     

On November 10, 2016, Gevo announced that gasoline blended with its isobutanol and marketed for use in automobiles has begun to be sold in the Houston area.  This marks the first time that Gevo s isobutanol has been specifically targeted towards on-road vehicles.  Musket Corporation is Gevo s distribution partner serving the Houston market. Musket is blending up specially formulated gasoline containing Gevo s isobutanol to distribute into the on-road automobile market.       

On September 30, 2016, we voluntarily paid off in full all outstanding amounts owed under the Amended Agri-Energy Loan Agreement and all material commitments and obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement and associated documents were terminated. As a result, at September 30, 2016, the Amended Agri-Energy Loan Agreement had a principal balance of zero. In connection with the repayment, TriplePoint terminated all of its security interests under the Loan and Security Agreement (including any mortgages and membership interest pledges). In addition, the guaranties by the Company and Gevo Development of the obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement were also terminated.     

On September 13, 2016, we completed the sale of 24,800,000 Series E units consisting of one share of our common stock and a half of one Series I warrant to purchase one share of common stock and 3,700,000 Series F units consisting of a pre-funded Series J warrant and a half of one Series I warrant to purchase one share of common stock, pursuant to an underwritten public offering.  We received gross proceeds of approximately $15.6 million, not including any future proceeds from the exercise of the warrants.     

On September 7, 2016, we announced that we had entered into a heads of agreement with Deutsche Lufthansa AG ( Lufthansa ) to supply Gevo s ATJ fuel from its first commercial hydrocarbons facility, intended to be built in Luverne, Minnesota.  The terms of the agreement contemplate Lufthansa purchasing up to 8 million gallons per year of ATJ fuel or up to 40 million gallons over the 5 year life of the proposed off-take agreement.  The heads of agreement establishes a selling price that is expected to allow for an appropriate level of return on the capital required to build-out our first commercial scale hydrocarbons facility.  The heads of agreement is non-binding and is subject to completion of a binding off-take agreement and other definitive documentation between Gevo and Lufthansa.     

 Outlook for 2016 
 As previously disclosed, we restarted production of isobutanol at the Luverne Plant in March 2016.  All operations, including the distillation system, are now up and running.  During the third quarter, we produced approximately 145,000 gallons of isobutanol.  During 2016, we have produced a total of approximately 240,000 gallons of isobutanol.   
 We have been pleased with the isobutanol fermentation performance and the equipment related to our isobutanol production that we have installed at the Luverne Plant is working as designed.  During the third quarter, ethanol and isobutanol production were negatively affected, primarily as a result of equipment issues on the ethanol side of the facility that resulted in three weeks of lost production time for isobutanol and lower ethanol production.  As a result, our production revenues during the third quarter were lower than expected.  We believe that the equipment issues on the ethanol side of the facility have been resolved and isobutanol production has recommenced. 
 In terms of our previously issued 2016 guidance, we expect: 

31 

To decrease the variable cost of producing isobutanol at our Luverne, Minneso  ta production facility to a range of $3.00-$3.50/gallon (assumes corn price of $3.65 per bushel and nets the value of the isobutanol distiller's grains), enabling isobutanol to be produced at a positive contribution margin, based on an expected average sel  ling price for isobutanol of between $3.50-$4.50/gallon;     

To increase sales of isobutanol into core markets such as the renewable ATJ fuel, marina, off-road, isooctane and solvents markets; and     

To achieve an average quarterly corporate-wide EBITDA burn rate (excluding stock-based compensation) of $3.5-$4.5 million.  (Corporate-wide EBITDA burn rate is calculated by adding back depreciation and non-cash stock compensation to GAAP loss from operations.)     

 Through the balance of 2016 and into 2017, we will continue to be focused on optimization work to improve the Luverne Plant at its current scale, but more importantly with a view towards significantly expanding the Luverne Plant.  We plan to optimize the overall production processes with the intent of improving robustness and consistency of production, increasing production volumes, and potentially producing specific grades of isobutanol tailored for specific applications.  This optimization work could result in us needing to add more equipment (tanks, controls, pumps, distillation columns, etc.), systems or processes in the future at the Luverne Plant.   
 We expect that by the end of 2016 we will have the capability to be at a production run rate equivalent to 1.5 million gallons per year at the Luverne Plant.  Although we expect to have this production capability, we currently expect to run at a rate less than 1.5 million gallons per year during 2017 as we scale up and test new process improvements to further reduce costs and optimize production in general at the Luverne Plant with a view towards significantly expanding production capacity in the future 
 Business Development 
 We continue to see solid interest in our isobutanol and isobutanol-related products, especially in the marine, off-road aviation, and isooctane markets.  This interest is manifesting itself in terms of customer demand for our current production from the Luverne Plant and our hydrocarbons demo facility in Silsbee, Texas, as well as, interest from multiple parties to enter into long term offtake agreements with us for isobutanol and isobutanol-related products such as renewable jet fuel and isooctane.  In 2016, most of our isobutanol sales have been focused on the marine and off-road markets.  In addition, our isobutanol has now been made available in the Houston market at multiple locations for on-road automotive use.  In the Houston market, our isobutanol is being blended with gasoline up to 12.5 percent and is being marketed as a high octane, ethanol-free gasoline.   
 Financial Condition  
 Our independent auditor included  going-concern  language in our audited financial statements for the year-ended December 31, 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred a consolidated net loss of $34.9 million and $28.2 million respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $374.4 million at September 30, 2016.  Our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 totaled $31.1 million which will be used for the following: (i) operating activities of our plant located in Luverne, Minnesota; (ii) operating activities at our corporate headquarters in Colorado, including research and development work; (iii) capital improvements primarily associated with the Agri-Energy Facility; (iv) costs associated with optimizing isobutanol production technology; (v) exploration of restructuring, strategic alternatives and new financings; and (vi) debt service and repayment obligations.  
 We expect to incur future net losses as we continue to fund the development and commercialization of our product candidates. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from multiple sales of equity and debt securities, borrowings under debt facilities and product sales.  While existing working capital at September 30, 2016 was sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund planned operations through December 31, 2016, it is not sufficient to satisfy all of our debt obligations expected to become due and payable in 2017.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our inability to continue as a going concern may potentially affect our rights and obligations under our debt obligations and may lead to bankruptcy.     
 Our t ransition to profitability is dependent upon, among other things, the successful development and commercialization of our products and product candidates, the achievement of a level of revenues adequate to support our existing cost st ructure and the repayment or restructuring of our debt obligations. We may never achieve profitability or generate positive cash flows, and unless and until we do, we will continue to need to raise additional capital. We intend to fund future operations through additional private and/or public offerings of debt or equity securities.  In addition, we may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources, may seek to restructure our debt and we will continue to address our cost structure. We intend to continue to explore various financing alternatives to improve our capital structure, including reducing debt and extending maturities. These efforts may include investments from a strategic partner, new equity or debt financings or exchange offers with our existing debt holders (including exchanges of debt for debt or equity securities) and other transactions involving our outstanding debt securities. 
 32 

Notwithstanding, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds, successfully complete a restructuring transaction on acceptable terms or at all, or achie  ve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from operations.  
 Restructuring/Recapitalization Process 
 As noted above, while our existing working capital at September 30, 2016 was sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund planned operations through December 31, 2016, it is not sufficient to satisfy all of our debt obligations expected to become due and payable in 2017.   
 As disclosed above, on May 31, 2016, we announced that we commenced a review of strategic alternatives.   As part of the process established by our Board of Directors and its financial advisor, we have engaged in discussions with Whitebox Advisors, LLC ( Whitebox ), the administrative agent for the holders of our 10% convertible senior secured notes due 2017, which were issued in June 2014 (the  2017 Notes ), with respect to a recapitalization of our debt.  We have also engaged in discussions with certain holders of our 2022 Notes.  We believe that a recapitalization transaction whereby our debt is reduced (and/or the maturity date is extended) and a sufficient amount of working capital is provided to fund operations would reduce the current liquidity risks for us.    
 On September 7, 2016, we entered into private exchange agreements with holders of our 2022 Notes, to exchange an aggregate of $11.4 million of principal amount of 2022 Notes for an aggregate of 13,999,354 shares of common stock.  These exchanges reduced the outstanding principal amount of the 2022 Notes to $11.0 million. 
 On September 30, 2016, we voluntarily paid off in full all outstanding amounts owed under the Amended Agri-Energy Loan Agreement and all material commitments and obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement and associated documents were terminated. As a result, at September 30, 2016, the Amended Agri-Energy Loan Agreement had a principal balance of zero. In connection with the repayment, TriplePoint terminated all of its security interests under the Loan and Security Agreement (including any mortgages and membership interest pledges). In addition, the guaranties by the Company and Gevo Development of the obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement were also terminated. 
 There can be no assurances that we will implement a recapitalization transaction.  If we are unable to implement a recapitalization or restructuring transaction involving Whitebox and the holders of the 2022 Notes, we will have to seek other strategic alternatives, including other sources of financing and, if unsuccessful, may be forced to seek the protection of bankruptcy court by filing for bankruptcy. 
 Special Meeting of Stockholders 
 On July 26, 2016, The NASDAQ Stock Market ( NASDAQ ) granted us an additional 180 calendar days, or until January 23, 2017, to regain compliance with the $1.00 per share minimum required for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market pursuant to NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the  Minimum Bid Price Rule ). As previously reported, on January 25, 2016, we received a notification letter (the  Notice ) from NASDAQ advising us that for 30 consecutive trading days preceding the date of the Notice, the bid price of our common stock had closed below the $1.00 per share minimum required for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market pursuant to the Minimum Bid Price Rule. We were unable to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule by July 25, 2016. We were provided 180 calendar days, or until July 25, 2016, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. The NASDAQ determination to grant the second compliance period was based on our meeting the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Rule, and our written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. 
 On October 31, 2016, we filed a definitive proxy statement with the SEC for the purpose of holding a special meeting of stockholders on Wednesday, December 14, 2016.  The purpose of the special meeting is to have stockholders of record, as of the close of business on October 26, 2016, vote on the approval of an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, by a ratio of not less than one-for-two and not more than one-for-twenty at any time on or prior to January 6, 2017, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number within this range by the Board of Directors of the Company in its sole discretion.   
 We believe that the reverse stock split is necessary to maintain our listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, and to provide us with resources and flexibility, with respect to our capital, sufficient to execute our business plans and strategy, and improve the marketability and liquidity of our common stock. 
 33 

Reverse Stock Split  
 On April 15, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a reverse split of our common stock, par value $0.01, at a ratio of one-for-fifteen.  This reverse stock split became effective on April 20, 2015 and, unless otherwise indicated, all share amounts, per share data, share prices, exercise prices and conversion rates set forth in this Report and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have, where applicable, been adjusted retroactively to reflect this reverse stock split. 
 Results of Operations  
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands)  

Revenues.   During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized revenue of $6.4 million associated with the sale of 3.7 million gallons of ethanol, as well as isobutanol and related products, a decrease of $1.2 million from the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease was primarily a result of lower ethanol production, ethanol prices and distiller grain prices.  Hydrocarbon revenue increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily as a result of timing of shipments of finished products from our demonstration plant located at the South Hampton Resources, Inc. facility near Houston, Texas (the  South Hampton Facility ).  Hydrocarbon revenues were comprised of jet fuel, isooctane and isooctene sales.   
 Cost of goods sold.  Cost of goods sold was $9.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $10.6 for the same quarter in 2015. Cost of goods sold in the 2016 period included approximately $8.2 million associated with the production of ethanol, isobutanol and related products and approximately $1.5 million in depreciation expense.  
 Research and development expense.  Research and development expense decreased by approximately $0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the same quarter in 2015, due primarily to a reduction in employee related expenses.  
 34 

Selling, general and administrative expense.   Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by $2.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, comp  ared with the same quarter in 2015, due primarily to a decrease of $2.5 million in general, patent, and litigation expenses.   
 Interest expense .  Interest expense in the third quarter of 2016 was $2.1 million, which was a decrease of $0.02 million over the same quarter last year.   
 (Loss)/Gain on exchange or conversion of debt.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a $0.9 million loss as a result of exchanging an aggregate of $11.4 million of principal amount of 2022 Notes for an aggregate of 13,999,354 shares of common stock.  
 (Loss)/Gain from change in fair value of the 2017 Notes.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a non-cash loss of $1.9 million during the quarter due to the quarterly mark-to-market valuation of the 2017 Notes.  
 (Loss)/Gain from change in fair value of derivative warrant liability.   During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of the derivative warrant liability decreased by $1.2 million, resulting in a non-cash gain from change in fair value of derivative warrant liability, primarily associated with the decrease in the price of Gevo s common stock in the quarter.   
 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands)  

Revenues . During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized revenue of $19.3 million associated with the sale of 11.4 million gallons of ethanol, as well as isobutanol and related products, a decrease of $1.3 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease was primarily a result of lower ethanol prices and distiller grain prices.  Hydrocarbon revenue was flat during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily as a result of timing of shipments of finished products from our   
 35 

demonstration plant located at the South Hampton Facility.  Hydrocarbon revenues were comprised of jet fuel, isooctane and isooctene sales.   
 Cost of goods sold.  Our cost of goods sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $25.3 million associated with the production of ethanol, isobutanol and related products and approximately $4.5 million in depreciation expense.   
 Research and development expense . Research and development expenses decreased approximately $1.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to a $1.0 million decrease related to reduced employee, consultant and contract staff related expenses and a $0.2 million decrease in costs related to the South Hampton Facility.   
 Selling, general and administrative expense .  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $7.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to an aggregate decrease of $6.9 million in general, patent, and litigation legal expenses.  
 Interest expense . Interest expense, including debt issue costs, increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 by $0.3 million from interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
 (Loss)/Gain on exchange or conversion of debt.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a $0.9 million loss as a result of exchanging an aggregate of $11.4 million of principal amount of 2022 Notes for an aggregate of 13,999,354 shares of common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a $0.3 million gain on extinguishment as a result of the conversion of $2.5 million of 2022 Notes in the first quarter of 2015.  
 (Loss)/Gain on extinguishment of warrant liability.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a $0.9 million loss on the extinguishment of warrant liabilities, primarily associated with adjustments to the exercise price on certain of our Series D Warrants and Series H Warrants.   
 (Loss)/Gain from change in fair value of the 2017 Notes . During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reported a $3.6 million loss associated with the increase in fair value of the 2017 Notes, primarily as a result of the 2017 Notes approaching maturity.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we reported a $3.6 million gain associated with the decrease in fair value of the 2017 Notes, primarily as a result of a decrease in the price of our common stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 (Loss)/Gain from change in fair value of derivative warrant liability . During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the estimated fair value of the derivative warrant liability decreased primarily associated with the increase in the price of our common stock between December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016.  This was offset by the value of the derivative increasing prior to exercise of the warrants.  As a result, the Company reported a $4.2 million loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
 Loss on issuance of equity . During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reported a $1.5 million loss associated with the April equity issuance primarily as a result of the estimated fair value of the common stock and warrants issued being greater than the consideration received in exchange.   
 Revenues, Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses  
 Revenues  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated revenue from: (i) the sale of ethanol, isobutanol and related products; (ii) hydrocarbon sales consisting primarily of the sale of ATJ fuel, isooctane and isooctene derived from our isobutanol for purposes of certification and testing; and (iii) government grants and research and development programs. 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Loss  
 Cost of goods sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily includes costs directly associated with isobutanol production and ethanol production at the Agri-Energy Facility, such as costs for direct materials, direct labor, depreciation, other operating costs and certain plant overhead costs.  Direct materials include corn feedstock, denaturant and process chemicals. Direct labor includes compensation of personnel directly involved in production operations at the Agri-Energy Facility. Other operating costs include utilities and natural gas usage.  
 Our gross loss is defined as our total revenue less our cost of goods sold. 
 36 

Research and Development   
 Our research and development costs consist of expenses incurred to identify, develop and test our technologies for the production of isobutanol and the development of downstream applications thereof. Research and development expenses include personnel costs (including stock-based compensation), consultants and related contract research, facility costs, supplies, depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment used in product development, license fees paid to third parties for use of their intellectual property and patent rights and other overhead expenses incurred to support our research and development programs. Research and development expenses also include upfront fees and milestone payments made under licensing agreements and payments for sponsored research and university research gifts to support research at academic institutions. 
 Selling, General and Administrative  
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation), consulting and service provider expenses (including patent counsel-related costs), legal fees, marketing costs, corporate insurance costs, occupancy-related costs, depreciation and amortization expenses on property, plant and equipment not used in our product development programs or recorded in cost of goods sold, travel and relocation and hiring expenses.  
 We also record selling, general and administrative expenses for the operations of the Agri-Energy Facility that include administrative and oversight expenses, certain personnel-related expenses, insurance and other operating expenses.  
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 Our independent auditor included  going-concern  language in our audited financial statements for the year-ended December 31, 2015.  For more information, see the section above entitled  Financial Condition.    
 Since our inception in 2005, we have devoted most of our cash resources to manufacturing, research and development, defense of intellectual property and selling, general and administrative activities related to the commercialization of isobutanol, as well as related products from renewable feedstocks.  We have incurred losses since inception and expect to incur losses through at least the remainder of 2016 and likely beyond.  To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from multiple sales of equity and debt securities, borrowings under debt facilities and product sales.   
 The continued operation of our business is dependent upon raising additional capital through future public and private equity offerings, debt financings or through other alternative financing arrangements. In addition, successful completion of our research and development programs and the attainment of profitable operations are dependent upon future events, including access to sufficient capital, repayment or restructuring of our current debt, completion of our development activities resulting in sales of isobutanol or isobutanol-derived products and/or technology, achieving market acceptance and demand for our products and services and attracting and retaining qualified personnel. 
 On April 1, 2016, the Company issued 10,292,858 Series F Warrants, 6,571,429 Series G Warrants, and 20,585,716 Series H Warrants to purchase the same number of shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering.  As of September 30, 2016, the Series F Warrants and H Warrants had an exercise price of $0.30 and $0.75 per share, respectively, were exercisable from the date of issuance and expire on April 1, 2021 and October 1, 2016, respectively.  The Series G Warrants were fully exercised in the second quarter of 2016.  The gross proceeds to us were approximately $3.5 million, not including any future proceeds from the exercise of the warrants. 
 On June 15, 2016, we closed a best efforts public offering of 21,080,456 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.45 per share.  The gross proceeds to us after agent placement fees were approximately $8.9 million. 
 On September 13, 2016, the Company issued 24,800,000 shares of common stock, 14,250,000 Series I Warrants and 3,700,000 Series J Warrants to purchase the same number of shares of our common stock.  As of September 30, 2016, the Series I Warrants had an exercise price of $0.55 per share, were exercisable from the date of issuance and expire on September 13, 2021.  The Series J Warrants were fully exercised in the current quarter.  The gross proceeds to us were approximately $15.6 million, not including any future proceeds from the exercise of the warrants. 
 In September 2016, the Company issued 13,999,354 shares of common stock in exchange for the redemption of $11.4 million of the 2022 Notes. The net loss on the extinguishment of the 2022 Notes was $0.9 million.    
 As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $374.4 million with cash and cash equivalents totaling $31.3 million.  
 37 

The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below (in thousands):   

Operating Activities  
 Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are personnel-related expenses, research and development-related expenses which include costs incurred under development agreements; costs and expenses for the production of isobutanol, ethanol and related products; logistics costs; costs associated with further processing of isobutanol and costs associated with the operation of the hydrocarbon demonstration production facility located in Silsbee, Texas.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used $16.2 million in cash from operating activities primarily resulting from a net loss of $34.9 million, partially offset by $20.3 million in non-cash gains and expenses and $1.6 million associated with working capital. 
 Investing Activities  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used $5.5 million in cash from investing activities related to capital expenditures at our Agri-Energy Facility. 
 Financing Activities  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we accumulated $35.8 million associated with financing activities, primarily from the public offerings in April, June, and September of 2016.  For more information, please see the sections above entitled  Financial Condition  and  Restructuring/Recapitalization Process . 
 2017 Notes  
 In May 2014, the Company entered into   a term loan agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with the lenders party thereto from time to time (each , a  Lender  and collectively the  Lenders ) and Whitebox, as administrative agent for the Lenders, with a maturity date of March 15, 2017, pursuant to which the Lenders committed to provide one or more senior secured term loans to the Company in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $31.1 million on the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement (collectively, the  Term Loan ).  The first advance of the Term Loan in the amount of  $22.8 million, net of discounts and issue costs of $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, was made to the Company in May 2014. Also in May 2014, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into an Exchange and Purchase Agreement (the  Exchange and Purchase Agreement ) with WB Gevo, Ltd. and the other Lenders party thereto from time to time and Whitebox, in its capacity as administrative agent for the Lenders. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange and Purchase Agreement, the Lenders were given the right, subject to certain conditions, to exchange all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan for our 2017 Notes which are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock.  While outstanding, the Term Loan bore an interest rate equal to 15% per annum, of which 5% was payable in cash and 10% was payable in kind and capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Term Loan. 
 In June 2014, the Lenders exchanged $25.9 million, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, for 2017 Notes, together with accrued paid-in-kind interest of $0.2 million. The terms of the 2017 Notes are set forth in an indenture by and among the Company, its subsidiaries in their capacity as guarantors, and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as trustee. The 2017 Notes will mature on March 15, 2017. The 2017 Notes have a conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) equal to $17.38 per share or 0.0576 shares per $1 principal amount of 2017 Notes.  The 2017 Notes do not contain any rights to anti-dilution adjustments for future equity issuances that are below the Conversion Price, and adjustments to the Conversion Price would be made only in the event that (i) there is a dividend or distribution paid on shares of our common stock or (ii) there is a subdivision, combination or reclassification of such common stock. Optional prepayment of the 2017 Notes is not permitted. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding principal on the 2017 Notes was $26.1 million. 
 See Note 7,  Senior Secured Debt, Secured Debt and 2022 Notes , to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of the 2017 Notes.   
 38 

2022 Notes   
 In July 2012, we sold $45.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes, with net proceeds of $40.9 million, after accounting for $2.7 million and $1.4 million of cash discounts and issue costs, respectively. The 2022 Notes bear interest at 7.5% which is to be paid semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year. 
 The 2022 Notes will mature on July 1, 2022, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted.  Additionally, on July 1, 2017, each holder will have the right to require us to repurchase all of such holder s 2022 Notes, or any portion thereof that is an integral multiple of $1,000 principal amount, for cash at a repurchase price of 100% of the principal amount of such 2022 Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon through, but excluding, the repurchase date.  The 2022 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $85.35 per share or 11.7113 shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Notes. 
 In September 2016, we entered into private exchange agreements with holders of the 2022 Notes, to exchange an aggregate of $11.4 million of principal amount of 2022 Notes for an aggregate of 13,999,354 shares of common stock.   
 As a result of certain conversions and exchanges, the principal balance of the 2022 Notes has been reduced to $11.0 million as of September 30, 2016. 
 See Note 7,  Senior Secured Debt, Secured Debt and 2022 Notes , to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of the 2022 Notes.   
 Secured Long-Term Debt  
 On September 30, 2016, we voluntarily paid off in full all outstanding amounts owed under the Amended Agri-Energy Loan Agreement and all material commitments and obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement and associated documents were terminated. As a result, at September 30, 2016, the Amended Agri-Energy Loan Agreement had a principal balance of zero. In connection with the repayment, TriplePoint terminated all of its security interests under the Loan and Security Agreement (including any mortgages and membership interest pledges). In addition, the guaranties by the Company and Gevo Development of the obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement were also terminated. 
 See Note 7,  Senior Secured Debt, Secured Debt and 2022 Notes , to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of the secured debt owed to TriplePoint.

For a discussion of our market risk associated with commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates, see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report.  
     Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosures. 
 Management, including the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.  In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. The design of any disclosure control and procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

40 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   
   Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   
 From time to time, we have been and may again become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any litigation that we believe to be material and we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. 
     Item 1A. Risk Factors.  
 You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report and the risk factors set forth below, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or future results. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors included in our Annual Report. The risk factors described herein and in our Annual Report are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. 
 Risks Relating to our Business and Strategy 
 We have a history of net losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability. 
 We have incurred net losses of $34.9 million, $36.2 million, $41.1 million, and $66.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $374.4 million. We expect to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future. We currently derive revenue from the sale of isobutanol, ethanol and related products at the Agri-Energy Facility, although over certain periods of time, we may and have operated the plant for the sole production of ethanol and related products to maximize cash flows.    
 Additionally, we have generated limited revenue from the sale of products such as alcohol-to-jet fuel produced from isobutanol, including for engine qualification and flight demonstration by the U.S. Air Force and other branches of the U.S. military. If our existing grants and cooperative agreements are canceled prior to the expected end dates or we are unable to obtain new grants, cooperative agreements or product supply contracts, our revenues could be adversely affected. 
 Furthermore, we expect to spend significant amounts on the further development and commercial implementation of our technology. We also expect to spend significant amounts acquiring and deploying additional equipment to attain final product specifications that may be required by future customers, acquiring or otherwise gaining access to additional ethanol plants and Retrofitting them for isobutanol production, on marketing, general and administrative expenses associated with our planned growth, on management of operations as a public company, and on debt service obligations. In addition, the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights and defending ourselves against claims by others that we may be violating their intellectual property rights may be significant. 
 As a result, even if our revenues increase substantially, we expect that our expenses will exceed revenues for the foreseeable future. We do not expect to achieve profitability during the foreseeable future, and may never achieve it. If we fail to achieve profitability, or if the time required to achieve profitability is longer than we anticipate, we may not be able to continue our business. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. 
 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain further financing. 
 Our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2015 included a  going concern  emphasis of matter paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2015, indicating that the amount of working capital at December 31, 2015 was not sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund planned operations through December 31, 2016 without additional sources of cash, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Uncertainty concerning our ability to continue as a going concern may hinder our ability to obtain future financing. Continued operations and our ability to continue as a going concern are dependent on our ability to obtain additional funding in the near future and thereafter, and there are no assurances that such funding will be available to us at all or will be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Without additional funds from private and/or public offerings of debt or equity securities, sales of assets, sales of our licenses of intellectual property or technologies, or other transactions, we will exhaust our resources and will be unable to continue operations. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, we may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection and our stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us. 
 41 

Risks Related to Owning Our Securities  
 We may not be able to comply with all applicable listing requirements or standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market and NASDAQ could delist our common stock. 
 Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards. 
 On January 25, 2016, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ Stock Market ( NASDAQ ), notifying us that, for the prior 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price of our common stock was not maintained at the minimum required closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share as required for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market. In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rules, we had an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, to regain compliance with this requirement. On July 26, 2016, NASDAQ granted us an additional 180 calendar days, or until January 23, 2017, to regain compliance. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days at any time before January 23, 2017.  The NASDAQ determination to grant the second compliance period was based on our meeting of the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and our written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. 
 We cannot provide any assurance that our stock price will recover or that our stockholders will approve a reverse stock split within the permitted grace period. In the event that our common stock is not eligible for quotation on another market or exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely be a reduction in our coverage by security analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. In addition, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a major exchange. 
 Furthermore, it would be a fundamental change under the indentures governing our convertible notes if our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange. In such circumstance we would be required to offer to repurchase our convertible notes at 100% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repurchase date. We would also be required to pay the holders of the 2017 Notes a fundamental change make-whole payment equal to the aggregate amount of interest that would have otherwise been payable on such notes, to, but not including, the maturity date of such notes. 
 Future issuances of our common stock or instruments convertible or exercisable into our common stock, including in connection with conversions of our convertible notes or exercises of warrants, may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock and cause dilution to our existing stockholders. 
 We may obtain additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in the near future, subject to certain limitations in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including our secured indebtedness. If we issue additional shares of common stock or instruments convertible into common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, the conversion of some or all of our convertible notes and/or the exercise of some or all of our outstanding warrants may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders, and any sales in the public market of any of our common stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Additionally, under the terms of certain warrants in the event that a warrant is exercised at a time when we do not have an effective registration statement covering the underlying shares of common stock on file with the SEC, such warrant may be net exercised, which will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders without any corresponding benefit to the Company of a cash payment for the exercise price of such warrant. 
 As of September 30, 2016, we had $11.0 million in outstanding 7.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022, which were issued in July 2012 (the  2022 Notes ), which were convertible into 1,083,761 shares of common stock at the conversion rate in effect on September 30, 2016 (which amount includes 954,937 shares of common stock issuable in full satisfaction of the coupon make-whole payments due in connection therewith). The anticipated conversion of the $11.0 million in outstanding 2022 Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the trading price of our common stock. In addition, we have the option to issue common stock to any converting holder in lieu of making any required coupon make-whole payment in cash. If we elect to issue our common stock for such payment, the stock will be valued at 90% of the simple average of the daily volume weighted average prices of our common stock for the 10 trading days ending on and including the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date. If our stock price decreases, the number of shares we would be required to deliver in connection with the coupon make-whole payments would increase. Given that the agreements governing our indebtedness may prohibit us from paying, repurchasing or redeeming the 2022 Notes or making cash payments in respect of the coupon make-whole payments due upon a conversion, we may be unable to make such payment in cash. If we issue additional shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such payments, this may cause significant additional dilution to our existing stockholders. 
 42 

As of September 30, 2016, we had $26.1 million in outstanding 10% Convertible Senior Not  es, due 2017, which were issued in June 2014 (the  2017 Notes ), which were convertible into 1,572,715 shares of our common stock at the conversion rate in effect on September 30, 2016. The   1,572,715 shares includes 68,89  4 shares of common stock that may b  e issuable from time to time in the event that the Company pays a portion of the interest on the 2017 Notes in kind or elects to pay make-whole payments due upon conversion of the 2017 Notes, if any, in shares of common stock. The anticipated conversion of   the outstanding 2017 Notes (including any interest that is paid in kind) into shares of our common stock could depress the trading price of our common stock. In addition, subject to certain restrictions, we have the option to issue common stock to any con  verting holder in lieu of making any required make-whole payment in cash. If we elect to issue our common stock for such payment, it will be at the same conversion rate that is applicable to conversions of the principal amount of the 2017 Notes. If we elec  t to issue additional shares of our common stock for such payments, this may cause significant additional dilution to our existing stockholders.  
 In addition, we issued common stock and warrants during the three months ended September 30, 2016 to finance operations and in exchange for redemption of a portion of our 2022 Notes, and may do so again in the future.  Such issuances diluted the ownership interests of our existing shareholders and adversely affected the price of our common stock. 
 We may not be able to execute a binding, definitive off-take agreement with Lufthansa reflecting the terms of the heads of agreement, or at all. 
 On September 7, 2016, we announced that we entered into a heads of agreement with Lufthansa to supply ATJ from our first commercial hydrocarbons plant intended to be built in Luverne, Minnesota. The terms of the agreement contemplate Lufthansa purchasing up to 8 million gallons of ATJ per year, or 40 million gallons over the life of a supply agreement. The heads of agreement is non-binding and subject to completion of a binding off-take agreement and other definitive documentation with Lufthansa. We can make no assurance that a binding, definitive off-take agreement reflecting the terms of the heads of agreement, or at all, will be completed. In addition, the heads of agreement contemplates and would require us to expand our isobutanol plant, which would require significant additional capital that we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, the transactions contemplated in the heads of agreement require Lufthansa and us to build out a supply chain to blend and deliver the finished fuel to targeted airports. If the binding documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated in the heads of agreement are not executed, or we are unable to expand our isobutanol plant and supply chain for any reason, we will not receive any of the potential benefits of the agreement, which may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and the value of our common stock. 
     Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 None. 
     Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
     Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.  
 Not Applicable. 
     Item 5. Other Information. 
 On November 11, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors adopted an amendment to Section 4(b) of the Company s Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) to provide that the limits on grants to participants are tied to a percentage of the total maximum number of shares issuable under Section 3(a) of the Plan rather than as of the Plan s original effective date in 2011.  A copy of the Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, dated November 11, 2016, is attached as Exhibit 10.4 to this Report.  Further, the Board of Directors ratified the previous grants made in 2015 that exceeded the limits as originally defined.

 GEVO, INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED 2010 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN   (As Amended and Restated by the Board of Directors on November 11, 2016)  

GEVO, INC. 
 AMENDED AND RESTATED 
 2010 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 
   
 Plan Document 

1.   Introduction .   
 (a)   Purpose .   Gevo, Inc. (the " Company ") hereby establishes this equity-based incentive compensation plan to be known as the "Gevo, Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan" (the " Plan "), for the following purposes: (i) to enhance the Company's ability to attract highly qualified personnel; (ii) to strengthen its retention capabilities; (iii) to enhance the long-term performance and competitiveness of the Company; and (iv) to align the interests of Plan participants with those of the Company's stockholders.  This Plan is intended to serve as the sole source for all future equity-based awards to those eligible for Plan participation. 
 (b)   Effective Date .  This Plan shall become effective on the closing date (the " Effective Date ") of the Company's initial public offering; subject to the Plan's receipt of stockholder approval beforehand in accordance with the Company's governing instruments. 
 (c)   Definitions .  Terms in the Plan and its Appendix that begin with an initial capital letter have the defined meaning set forth in Appendix I or elsewhere in this Plan, in either case unless the context of their use clearly indicates a different meaning. 
 (d)   Effect on Other Plans, Awards, and Arrangements .  This Plan is not intended to affect and shall not affect any stock options, equity-based compensation, or other benefits that the Company or its Affiliates may have provided, or may separately provide in the future, pursuant to any agreement, plan, or program that is independent of this Plan. 
 (e)   Sole Source for Future Stock Awards .  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, no further awards of any kind shall occur under any other Company plan or program that entails the issuance of Share-settled awards (including but not limited to the Prior Plan), and any Shares that are currently subject to awards under any such plans which are subsequently forfeited, cancelled, settled or lapse unexercised shall be added to the reserve of Shares that are authorized and available for issuance pursuant to this Plan. 
 2.   Types of Awards .  The Plan permits the granting of the following types of Awards according to the Sections of the Plan listed here: 
 Section 5 Stock Options  
 Section 6 Share Appreciation Rights ( " SARs ") 
 Section 7 Restricted Shares, Restricted Share Units ( " RSUs "), and Unrestricted Shares 
 -2- 

Section 8  Deferred Share Units (  "  DSUs  "  )  
 Section 9 Performance and Cash-settled Awards  

Section 10   
 
 Dividend Equivalent Rights    

 3.   Shares Available for Awards .   
 (a)   Generally .  Subject to Section 3(b) and Section 13 below, the aggregate number of Shares which may be issued pursuant to Awards under the Plan is the sum of (i) 4,371,419 Shares and (ii) any Shares which as of the Effective Date are subject to awards under the Prior Plan which are subsequently forfeited, cancelled, settled, or lapse unexercised.  The Shares deliverable pursuant to Awards shall be authorized but unissued Shares, or Shares that the Company otherwise holds in treasury or in trust. 
 (b)   Replenishment; Counting of Shares .  Any Shares reserved for Plan Awards will again be available for future Awards if the Shares for any reason will never be issued to a Participant or Beneficiary pursuant to an Award (for example, due to its settlement in cash rather than in Shares, or the Award's forfeiture, cancellation, expiration, or net settlement without the issuance of Shares).  Further, and to the extent permitted under Applicable Law, the maximum number of Shares available for delivery under the Plan shall not be reduced by any Shares issued under the Plan through the settlement, assumption, or substitution of outstanding awards or obligations to grant future awards as a condition of the Company's or an Affiliate's acquiring another entity.  On the other hand, Shares that a Person owns and tenders in payment of all or part of the exercise price of an Award or in satisfaction of applicable Withholding Taxes shall not increase the number of Shares available for future issuance under the Plan. 
 4.   Eligibility .   
 (a)   General Rule .  Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine from the class of Eligible Persons those Persons to whom Awards may be granted.  Each Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that sets forth its Grant Date and all other terms and conditions of the Award, that is signed on behalf of the Company (or delivered by an authorized agent through an electronic medium), and that, if required by the Committee, is signed by the Eligible Person as an acceptance of the Award.  The grant of an Award shall not obligate the Company or any Affiliate to continue the employment or service of any Eligible Person, or to provide any future Awards or other remuneration at any time thereafter. 
 (b)   Award Limits per Person.  During the term of the Plan, no Participant may receive Options and SARs that relate to more than 20% of the maximum number of Shares issuable under Section 3(a) of the Plan, as such number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 13 below.  During any calendar year, no Participant may receive Incentive Stock Options or Awards in the aggregate (including Incentive Stock Options) that relate to more than 20% of the maximum number of Shares issuable under Section 3(a) of the Plan, as such number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 13 below.    
   (c)   Replacement Awards .  Subject to Applicable Law (including any associated stockholder approval requirements), the Committee may, in its sole discretion and upon such terms as it deems appropriate, require as a condition of the grant of an Award to a Participant  
 -3- 

that the Participant consent to surrender for cancellation some or all of the Awards or other grants that the Participant has received under this Plan or otherwise.  An Award conditioned upon such surrender may or may not be the same type of Award, may cover the same (or a lesser or greater) number of Shares as such surrendered Award, may have other terms that are determined without regard to the terms or conditions of such surrendered Award, and may contain any other terms that the Committee deems appropriate.  In the case of Options and SARs, these other terms may not involve an exercise price that is lower than the exercise price of the surrendered Option or SAR unless the Company's stockholders approve the grant itself or the program under which the grant is made pursuant to the Plan.  
 5.   Stock Options . 
 (a)   Grants .  Subject to the special rules for ISOs set forth in the next paragraph, the Committee may grant Options to Eligible Persons pursuant to Award Agreements setting forth terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan, that may be immediately exercisable or that may become exercisable in whole or in part based on future events or conditions, that may include vesting or other requirements for the right to exercise the Option, and that may differ for any reason between Eligible Persons or classes of Eligible Persons, provided in all instances that: 
 (i)  the exercise price for Shares subject to purchase through exercise of an Option that is intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares on the Grant Date; and 
 (ii)  no Option shall be exercisable for a term ending more than ten years after its Grant Date. 
 (b)   Special ISO Provisions .  The following provisions shall control any grants of Options that are denominated as ISOs; provided that ISOs may not be awarded unless the Plan receives stockholder approval within twelve (12) months after its Effective Date, and ISOs may not be granted more than ten (10) years after Board approval of the Plan. 
 (i)   Eligibility .  The Committee may grant ISOs only to Employees (including officers who are Employees) of the Company or an Affiliate that is a "parent corporation" or "subsidiary corporation" within the meaning of Code Section 424. 
 (ii)   Documentation .  Each Option that is intended to be an ISO must be designated in the Award Agreement as an ISO, provided that any Option designated as an ISO will be a Non-ISO to the extent the Option fails to meet the requirements of Code Section 422 or the provisions of this Section 5(b).  In the case of an ISO, the Committee shall determine on the Date of Grant the acceptable methods of paying the exercise price for Shares, and it shall be included in the applicable Award Agreement. 
   (iii)   $100,000 Limit .  To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares with respect to which ISOs first become exercisable by a Participant in any calendar year (under this Plan and any other plan of the  
 -4- 

Company or any Affiliate) exceeds U.S. $100,000, such excess Options shall be treated as Non-ISOs.  For purposes of determining whether the U.S. $100,000 limit is exceeded, the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to an ISO shall be determined as of the Grant Date.  In reducing the number of Options treated as ISOs to meet the U.S. $100,000 limit, the most recently granted Options shall be reduced first.  In the event that Code Section 422 is amended to alter the limitation set forth therein, the limitation of this paragraph and the corresponding references to the $100,000 limit throughout this Plan shall be automatically adjusted accordingly as of the date the amendment to Code Section 422 is effective.  
 (iv)   Grants to 10% Holders .  In the case of an ISO granted to an Employee who is a Ten Percent Holder on the Grant Date, the ISO's term shall not exceed five years from the Grant Date, and the exercise price shall be at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares on the Grant Date.  In the event that Code Section 422 is amended to alter the limitations set forth therein, the limitation of this paragraph shall be automatically adjusted accordingly. 
 (v)   Substitution of Options .  In the event the Company or an Affiliate acquires (whether by purchase, merger, or otherwise) all or substantially all of outstanding capital stock or assets of another corporation or in the event of any reorganization or other transaction qualifying under Code Section 424, the Committee may, in accordance with the provisions of that Section, substitute ISOs for ISOs previously granted under the plan of the acquired company provided (A) the excess of the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to an ISO immediately after the substitution over the aggregate exercise price of such shares is not more than the similar excess immediately before such substitution, and (B) the new ISO does not give additional benefits to the Participant, including any extension of the exercise period. 
 (vi)   Notice of Disqualifying Dispositions .  By executing an ISO Award Agreement, each Participant agrees to notify the Company in writing immediately after the Participant sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of any Shares acquired through exercise of the ISO, if such disposition occurs within the earlier of (A) two years of the Grant Date, or (B) one year after the exercise of the ISO being exercised.  Each Participant further agrees to provide any information about a disposition of Shares as may be requested by the Company to assist it in complying with any applicable tax laws. 
   (c)   Method of Exercise .  Each Option may be exercised, in whole or in part (provided that the Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares) at any time and from time to time prior to its expiration, but only pursuant to the terms of the applicable Award Agreement, and subject to the times, circumstances and conditions for exercise contained in the applicable Award Agreement.  Exercise shall occur by delivery of both written notice of exercise to the secretary of the Company, and payment of the full exercise price for the Shares being purchased.   
 -5- 

The methods of payment that the Committee may in its discretion accept or commit to accept in an Award Agreement include:  
 (i)  cash or check payable to the Company (in U.S. dollars); 
 (ii)  other Shares that (A) are owned by the Participant who is purchasing Shares pursuant to an Option, (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which the Option is being exercised, (C) are all, at the time of such surrender, free and clear of any and all claims, pledges, liens and encumbrances, or any restrictions which would in any manner restrict the transfer of such shares to or by the Company (other than such restrictions as may have existed prior to an issuance of such Shares by the Company to such Participant), and (D) are duly endorsed for transfer to the Company; 
 (iii)  a net exercise by surrendering to the Company Shares otherwise receivable upon exercise of the Option; 
 (iv)  a cashless exercise program that the Committee may approve, from time to time in its discretion, pursuant to which a Participant may elect to concurrently provide irrevocable instructions (A) to such Participant's broker or dealer to effect the immediate sale of the purchased Shares and remit to the Company, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the exercise price of the Option plus all applicable taxes required to be withheld by the Company by reason of such exercise, and (B) to the Company to deliver the certificates for the purchased Shares directly to such broker or dealer in order to complete the sale; or 
 (v)  any combination of the foregoing methods of payment. 
 The Company shall not be required to deliver Shares pursuant to the exercise of an Option until the Company has received sufficient funds to cover the full exercise price due and all applicable Withholding Taxes required by reason of such exercise. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Participant who is a Director or an "executive officer" of the Company within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act shall be permitted to make payment with respect to any Awards granted under the Plan, or continue any extension of credit with respect to such payment with a loan from the Company or a loan arranged by the Company in violation of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act. 
 (d)   Exercise of an Unvested Option .  The Committee in its sole discretion may allow a Participant to exercise an unvested Option, in which case the Shares then issued shall be Restricted Shares having analogous vesting restrictions to the unvested Option. 
   (e)   Termination of Continuous Service .  The Committee may establish and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement the terms and conditions on which an Option shall remain exercisable, if at all, following termination of a Participant's Continuous Service.  The Committee may waive or modify these provisions at any time.  To the extent that a Participant is  
 -6- 

not entitled to exercise an Option at the date of his or her termination of Continuous Service, or if the Participant (or other person entitled to exercise the Option) does not exercise the Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified in the Award Agreement or below (as applicable), the Option shall terminate and the Shares underlying the unexercised portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan and become available for future Awards.  
 The following provisions shall apply to the extent an Award Agreement does not specify the terms and conditions upon which an Option shall terminate when there is a termination of a Participant's Continuous Service: 

Reason for terminating Continuous Service  

Option Termination Date  

(I)  By the Company for Cause, or what would have been Cause if the Company had known all of the relevant facts.  

Termination of the Participant's Continuous Service, or when Cause first existed if earlier.  

(II)  Disability of the Participant.  

Within one year after termination of the Participant's Continuous Service.  

(III)  Retirement of the Participant.  

Within six months after termination of the Participant's Continuous Service.  

(IV)  Death of the Participant during Continuous Service or within 90 days thereafter.  

Within one year after termination of the Participant's Continuous Service.  

(V)  Other than any of the above.  

Within 90 days after termination of the Participant's Continuous Service.  

If there is a Securities and Exchange Commission blackout period (or a Committee-imposed blackout period) that prohibits the buying or selling of Shares during any part of the ten day period before the expiration of any Option based on the termination of a Participant's Continuous Service (as described above), the period for exercising the Option shall be extended until ten days beyond when such blackout period ends.  Notwithstanding any provision hereof or within an Award Agreement, no Option shall ever be exercisable after the expiration date of its original term as set forth in the Award Agreement. 
   (f)   Buyout .  Subject to the provisions of Section 19, the Committee may at any time offer to buy out an Option, in exchange for a payment in cash or Shares, based on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish and communicate to the Participant at the time that such offer is made.  In addition, but subject to Applicable Law, if the Fair Market Value for Shares subject to any Option or Options is more than 50% below their exercise price for more than 30 consecutive business days, the Committee may unilaterally declare such Option to be terminated, effective on the date on which the Committee provides written notice to the Participant or other Option holder.  The Committee may take such action with respect to any or all Options granted under the Plan and with respect to any individual Option holder or class or classes of Option holders, and the Committee shall not have any obligation to be uniform, consistent, or nondiscriminatory between classes of similarly-situated Option holders, except as  
 -7- 

required by Applicable Law (including any applicable stockholder approval requirements for a re-pricing or similar option cancellation program).  
 6.   SAR s .   
 (a)   Grants .  The Committee may grant SARs to Eligible Persons pursuant to Award Agreements setting forth terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan; provided that: 
 (i)  the exercise price for the Shares subject to each SAR shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares on the Grant Date; 
 (ii)  no SAR shall be exercisable for a term ending more than ten years after its Grant Date; and 
 (iii)  each SAR shall, except to the extent a SAR Award Agreement provides otherwise, be subject to the provisions of Section 5(e) relating to the effect of a termination of Participant's Continuous Service and Section 5(f) relating to buyouts, in each case with "SAR" being substituted for "Option." 
 (b)   Settlement .  Subject to the Plan's terms, a SAR shall entitle the Participant, upon exercise of the SAR, to receive Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the product of the number of Shares as to which the SAR is being exercised, and the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value, on such date, of the Shares covered by the exercised SAR, over (ii) an exercise price designated in the SAR Award Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a SAR Award Agreement may limit the total settlement value that the Participant will be entitled to receive upon the SAR's exercise, and may provide for settlement either in cash or in any combination of cash or Shares that the Committee may authorize pursuant to an Award Agreement.  If, on the date on which a SAR or portion thereof is to expire, the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares exceeds the aggregate exercise price of such SAR, then the SAR shall be deemed exercised and the Participant shall within ten days thereafter receive the Shares that would have been issued on such date if the Participant had affirmatively exercised the SAR on that date. 
 (c)   SARs related to Options .  The Committee may grant SARs either concurrently with the grant of an Option or with respect to an outstanding Option, in which case the SAR shall extend to all or a portion of the Shares covered by the related Option, and shall have an exercise price that is not less than the exercise price of the related Option.  A SAR shall entitle the Participant who holds the related Option, upon exercise of the SAR and surrender of the related Option, or portion thereof, to the extent the SAR and related Option each were previously unexercised, to receive payment of an amount determined pursuant to Section 6(b) above.  Any SAR granted in tandem with an ISO will contain such terms as may be required to comply with the provisions of Code Section 422. 
 (d)   Effect on Available Shares .  Upon each exercise of a SAR that is settled in Shares, only those Shares that are issued or delivered in settlement of the exercise shall be counted against the number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan. 
 -8- 

7.    Restricted Shares, RSUs, and Unrestricted Share Awards  .  
 (a)   Grant .  The Committee may grant Restricted Share, RSU, or Unrestricted Share Awards to Eligible Persons, in all cases pursuant to Award Agreements setting forth terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan.  The Committee shall establish as to each Restricted Share or RSU Award the number of Shares deliverable or subject to the Award (which number may be determined by a written formula), and the period or periods of time (the " Restriction Period ") at the end of which all or some restrictions specified in the Award Agreement shall lapse, and the Participant shall receive unrestricted Shares (or cash to the extent provided in the Award Agreement) in settlement of the Award.  Such restrictions may include, without limitation, restrictions concerning voting rights and transferability, and such restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times and pursuant to such circumstances or based on such criteria as selected by the Committee, including, without limitation, criteria based on the Participant's duration of employment, directorship or consultancy with the Company, individual, group, or divisional performance criteria, Company performance, or other criteria selected by the Committee.  The Committee may make Restricted Share and RSU Awards with or without the requirement for payment of cash or other consideration.  In addition, the Committee may grant Awards hereunder in the form of Unrestricted Shares which shall vest in full upon the Grant Date or such other date as the Committee may determine or which the Committee may issue pursuant to any program under which one or more Eligible Persons (selected by the Committee in its sole discretion) elect to pay for such Shares or to receive Unrestricted Shares in lieu of cash bonuses that would otherwise be paid. 
 (b)   Vesting and Forfeiture .  The Committee shall set forth, in an Award Agreement granting Restricted Shares or RSUs, the terms and conditions under which the Participant's interest in the Restricted Shares or the Shares subject to RSUs will become vested and non-forfeitable.  Except as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement or as the Committee otherwise determines, upon termination of a Participant's Continuous Service for any reason, the Participant shall forfeit his or her Restricted Shares and RSUs to the extent the Participant's interest therein has not vested on or before such termination date; provided that if a Participant purchases Restricted Shares and forfeits them for any reason, the Company shall return the purchase price to the Participant to the extent either set forth in an Award Agreement or required by Applicable Laws. 
 (c)   Certificates for Restricted Shares .  Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, the Company shall hold certificates representing Restricted Shares and dividends (whether in Shares or cash) that accrue with respect to them until the restrictions lapse, and the Participant shall provide the Company with appropriate stock powers endorsed in blank.  The Participant's failure to provide such stock powers within ten days after a written request from the Company shall entitle the Committee to unilaterally declare a forfeiture of all or some of the Participant's Restricted Shares. 
   (d)   Section 83(b) Elections .  A Participant may make an election under Code Section 83(b) (the " Section 83(b) Election ") with respect to Restricted Shares.  A Participant who has received RSUs may, within ten days after receiving the RSU Award, provide the Committee with a written notice of his or her desire to make a Section 83(b) Election with respect to the Shares subject to such RSUs.  The Committee may in its discretion convert the  
 -9- 

Participant's RSUs into Restricted Shares, on a one-for-one basis, in full satisfaction of the Participant's RSU Award.  The Participant may then make a Section 83(b) Election with respect to those Restricted Shares.  A Section 83(b) Election will be invalid if not filed with the Company and the appropriate U.S. tax authorities within 30 days after the Grant Date of the RSUs that are thereafter replaced by the Restricted Shares or, if inapplicable, the original Restricted Share Award.  
 (e)   Deferral Elections for RSUs .  To the extent specifically provided in an Award Agreement, a Participant may irrevocably elect, in accordance with Section 8 below, to defer the receipt of all or a percentage of the Shares that would otherwise be transferred to the Participant both more than 12 months after the date of the Participant's deferral election and upon the vesting of an RSU Award.  If the Participant makes this election, the Company shall credit the Shares subject to the election, and any associated Shares attributable to Dividend Equivalent Rights attached to the Award, to a DSU account established pursuant to Section 8 below on the date such Shares would otherwise have been delivered to the Participant pursuant to this Section. 
 (f)   Issuance of Shares upon Vesting .  As soon as practicable after vesting of a Participant's Restricted Shares (or of the right to receive Shares underlying RSUs), the Company shall deliver to the Participant, free from vesting restrictions, one Share for each surrendered and vested Restricted Share (or deliver one Share free of the vesting restriction for each vested RSU), unless an Award Agreement provides otherwise and subject to Section 11 regarding Withholding Taxes.  No fractional Shares shall be distributed, and cash shall be paid in lieu thereof. 
 8.   DSUs . 
 (a)   Elections to Defer .  The Committee may make DSU awards to Eligible Persons pursuant to Award Agreements (regardless of whether or not there is a deferral of the Eligible Person's compensation), and may permit select Eligible Persons to irrevocably elect, on a form provided by and acceptable to the Committee (the " Election Form "), to forego the receipt of cash or other compensation (including the Shares deliverable pursuant to any RSU Award) and in lieu thereof to have the Company credit to an internal Plan account a number of DSUs having a Fair Market Value equal to the Shares and other compensation deferred.  These credits will be made at the end of each calendar quarter (or other period determined by the Committee) during which compensation is deferred.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, a Participant's Election Form will be ineffective with respect to any compensation that the Participant earns before the date on which the Election Form takes effect.  For any Participant who is subject to U.S. income taxation, the Committee shall only authorize deferral elections under this Section (i) pursuant to written procedures, and using written Election Forms, that satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A, and (ii) only by Eligible Persons who are Directors, Consultants, or members of a select group of management or highly compensated Employees (within the meaning of ERISA). 
 (b)   Vesting .  Unless an Award Agreement expressly provides otherwise, each Participant shall be 100% vested at all times in any Shares subject to DSUs. 
   (c)   Issuances of Shares .  Unless an Award Agreement expressly provides otherwise, the Company shall settle a Participant's DSU Award, by delivering one Share for each DSU, in five substantially equal annual installments that are issued before the last day of each of the five  
 -10- 

calendar years that end after the date on which the Participant's Continuous Service ends for any reason, subject to    
 (i)  the Participant's right to elect a different form of distribution, only on a form provided by and acceptable to the Committee, that permits the Participant to select any combination of a lump sum and annual installments that are triggered by, and completed within ten years following, the last day of the Participant's Continuous Service, and 
 (ii)  the Company's acceptance of the Participant's distribution election form executed at the time the Participant elects to defer the receipt of cash or other compensation pursuant to Section 8(a), provided that the Participant may change a distribution election through any subsequent election that (A) the Participant delivers to the Company at least one year before the date on which distributions are otherwise scheduled to commence pursuant to the Participant's initial distribution election, and (B) defers the commencement of distributions by at least five years from the originally scheduled distribution commencement date. 
 Fractional shares shall not be issued, and instead shall be paid out in cash. 
 (d)   Emergency Withdrawals .  In the event that a Participant suffers an unforeseeable emergency within the contemplation of this Section, the Participant may apply to the Committee for an immediate distribution of all or a portion of the Participant's DSUs.  The unforeseeable emergency must result from a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the Participant, the Participant's spouse, or a dependent (within the meaning of Code Section 152) of the Participant, casualty loss of the Participant's property, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable conditions beyond the control of the Participant.  The Committee shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, determine whether a Participant has a qualifying unforeseeable emergency, may require independent verification of the emergency, and may determine whether or not to provide the Participant with cash or Shares.  Examples of purposes which are not considered unforeseeable emergencies include post-secondary school expenses or the desire to purchase a residence.  In no event will a distribution be made to the extent the unforeseeable emergency could be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, or by liquidation of the Participant's nonessential assets to the extent such liquidation would not itself cause a severe financial hardship.  The amount of any distribution hereunder shall be limited to the amount necessary to relieve the Participant's unforeseeable emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution.  The number of Shares subject to the Participant's DSU Award shall be reduced by any Shares distributed to the Participant and by a number of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of the distribution equal to any cash paid to the Participant pursuant to this Section.  For all DSUs granted to Participants who are U.S. taxpayers, the term "unforeseeable emergency" shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A. 
   (e)   Termination of Service .  For purposes of this Section, a Participant's "Continuous Service" shall only end when the Participant incurs a "separation from service" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations   1.409A-1(h).  A Participant shall be considered to have experienced a termination of Continuous Service when the facts and circumstances indicate that  
 -11- 

either (i) no further services will be performed for the Company or any Affiliate after a certain date, or (ii) that the level of bona fide services the Participant will perform after such date (whether as an Employee, Director, or Consultant) are reasonably expected to permanently decrease to no more than 50% of the average level of bona fide services performed by such Participant (whether as an Employee, Director, or Consultant) over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or full period of services to the Company and its Affiliates if the Participant has been providing such services for less than 36 months).  
 9.   Performance and Cash-Settled Awards .   
 (a)   Performance Units .  Subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (b) hereof, the Committee may in its discretion grant Performance Awards, including Performance Units to any Eligible Person, including Performance Unit Awards that (i) have substantially the same financial benefits and other terms and conditions as Options, SARs, RSUs, or DSUs, but (ii) are settled only in cash.  All Awards hereunder shall be made pursuant to Award Agreements setting forth terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan. 
 (b)   Performance Compensation Awards .  Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section, the Committee may, at the time of grant of a Performance Unit, designate such Award as a " Performance Compensation Award " (payable in cash or Shares) in order that such Award constitutes "qualified performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m), and has terms and conditions designed to qualify as such.  With respect to each such Performance Compensation Award, the Committee shall establish, in writing within the time required under Code Section 162(m), a " Performance Period ," " Performance Measure(s) ", and " Performance Formula(e) " (each such term being defined below).  Once established for a Performance Period, the Performance Measure(s) and Performance Formula(e) shall not be amended or otherwise modified to the extent such amendment or modification would cause the compensation payable pursuant to the Award to fail to constitute qualified performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m). 
 A Participant shall be eligible to receive payment in respect of a Performance Compensation Award only to the extent that the Performance Measure(s) for such Award is achieved and the Performance Formula(e) as applied against such Performance Measure(s) determines that all or some portion of such Participant's Award has been earned for the Performance Period.  As soon as practicable after the close of each Performance Period, the Committee shall review and certify in writing whether, and to what extent, the Performance Measure(s) for the Performance Period have been achieved and, if so, determine and certify in writing the amount of the Performance Compensation Award to be paid to the Participant and, in so doing, may use negative discretion to decrease, but not increase, the amount of the Award otherwise payable to the Participant based upon such performance 
   (c)   Limitations on Awards .  The maximum Performance Award and the maximum Performance Compensation Award that any one Participant may receive for any one Performance Period, without regard to time of vesting or exercisability, shall not together exceed the limitation set forth in Section 4(b) above, as adjusted pursuant to Section 13 below (or, for Performance Units to be settled in cash, U.S. $2,000,000 determined on the Grant Date).  The Committee shall have the discretion to provide in any Award Agreement that any amounts  
 -12- 

earned in excess of these limitations will be credited as DSUs or as deferred cash compensation under a separate plan of the Company (provided in the latter case that such deferred compensation either bears a reasonable rate of interest or has a value based on one or more predetermined actual investments).  Any amounts for which payment to the Participant is deferred pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid to the Participant in a future year or years not earlier than, and only to the extent that, the Participant is either not receiving compensation in excess of these limits for a Performance Period, or is not subject to the restrictions set forth under Code Section 162(b).  
 (d)   Definitions .   
 (i)  " Performance Formula " means, for a Performance Period, one or more objective formulas or standards established by the Committee for purposes of determining whether or the extent to which an Award has been earned based on the level of performance attained or to be attained with respect to one or more Performance Measure(s).  Performance Formulae may vary from Performance Period to Performance Period and from Participant to Participant and may be established on a stand-alone basis, in tandem or in the alternative. 
 (ii)  " Performance Measure " means one or more of the following selected by the Committee to measure Company, Affiliate, and/or business unit performance for a Performance Period, whether in absolute or relative terms (including, without limitation, terms relative to a peer group or index): income or profit, including but not limited to basic, diluted, or adjusted earnings per share, earnings before interest, taxes, and/or other adjustments (in total or on a per share basis), basic or adjusted net income, gross margin, or similar income or profit measure; returns on equity, assets, capital, revenue or similar return measure; economic profit, economic value added, or similar measure of residual income; revenues or sales; working capital; cash usage; total stockholder return; and costs, product development, technology development, market share, research, securement of intellectual property rights, licensing, litigation, human resources, information services, mergers, acquisitions, sales of assets of Affiliates or business units.  Each such measure shall be, to the extent applicable, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as consistently applied by the Company (or such other standard applied by the Committee) and, if so determined by the Committee, and in the case of a Performance Compensation Award, to the extent permitted under Code Section 162(m), adjusted to omit the effects of extraordinary items, gain or loss on the disposal of a business segment, unusual or infrequently occurring events and transactions and cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles.  Performance Measures may vary from Performance Period to Performance Period and from Participant to Participant, and may be established on a stand-alone basis, in tandem or in the alternative. 
 (iii)  " Performance Period " means one or more periods of time (of not less than one fiscal year of the Company), as the Committee may designate, over which the attainment of one or more Performance Measure(s) will be measured for the purpose of determining a Participant's rights in respect of an Award. 
 -13- 

(e)    Deferral Elections  .  At any time prior to the date that is both at least six months before the close of a Performance Period (or shorter or longer period that the Committee selects) with respect to a Performance Award and at which time vesting or payment is substantially uncertain to occur, the Committee may permit a Participant who is a member of a select group of management or highly compensated employees (within the meaning of ERISA) to irrevocably elect, on a form provided by and acceptable to the Committee, to defer the receipt of all or a percentage of the cash or Shares that would otherwise be transferred to the Participant upon the vesting of such Award.  If the Participant makes this election, the cash or Shares subject to the election, and any associated interest and dividends, shall be credited to an account established pursuant to Section 8 hereof on the date such cash or Shares would otherwise have been released or issued to the Participant pursuant to this Section.  
 10.   Dividend Equivalent Rights .  The Committee may grant Dividend Equivalent Rights to any Eligible Person, and may do either pursuant to an Award Agreement that is independent of any other Award, or through a provision in another Award (other than an Option or SAR) that Dividend Equivalent Rights attach to the Shares underlying the Award.  For example, and without limitation, the Committee may grant a Dividend Equivalent Right in respect of each Share subject to a Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, Deferred Share Unit, or Performance Share Award. 
 (a)   Nature of Right .  Each Dividend Equivalent Right shall represent the right to receive amounts based on the dividends declared on Shares as of all dividend payment dates during the term of the Dividend Equivalent Right as determined by the Committee.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a Dividend Equivalent Right shall expire upon termination of the Participant's Continuous Service, provided that a Dividend Equivalent Right that is granted as part of another Award shall expire only when the Award is settled or otherwise forfeited. 
 (b)   Settlement .  Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid out on the (i) on the record date for dividends if the Award occurs on a stand-alone basis, and (ii) on the vesting or later settlement date for another Award if the Dividend Equivalent Right is granted as part of it.  Payment of all amounts determined in accordance with this Section shall be in Shares, with cash paid in lieu of fractional Shares, provided that the Committee may instead provide in an Award Agreement for cash settlement of all or part of the Dividend Equivalent Rights.  Only the Shares actually issued pursuant to Dividend Equivalent Rights shall count against the limits set forth in Section 3 above. 
 (c)   Other Terms .  The Committee may impose such other terms and conditions on the grant of a Dividend Equivalent Right as it deems appropriate in its discretion as reflected by the terms of the Award Agreement.  The Committee may establish a program under which Dividend Equivalent Rights may be granted in conjunction with other Awards.  The Committee may also authorize, for any Participant or group of Participants, a program under which the payments with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights may be deferred pursuant to the terms and conditions determined under Section 9 above. 
 -14- 

11.    Taxes; Withholding  .    
 (a)   General Rule .  Participants are solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may arise in connection with Awards, and neither the Company, nor any Affiliate, nor any of their employees, directors, or agents shall have any obligation to mitigate, indemnify, or to otherwise hold any Participant harmless from any or all of such taxes.  The Company's obligation to deliver Shares (or to pay cash) to Participants pursuant to Awards is at all times subject to their prior or coincident satisfaction of all required Withholding Taxes.  Except to the extent otherwise either provided in an Award Agreement or thereafter authorized by the Committee, the Company or any Affiliate will satisfy required Withholding Taxes that the Participant has not otherwise arranged to settle before the due date thereof   
 (i)  first from withholding the cash otherwise payable to the Participant pursuant to the Award; 
 (ii)  then by withholding and cancelling the Participant's rights with respect to a number of Shares that (A) would otherwise have been delivered to the Participant pursuant to the Award, and (B) have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the Withholding Taxes (such withheld Shares to be valued on the basis of the aggregate Fair Market Value thereof on the date of the withholding); and 
 (iii)  finally, withholding the cash otherwise payable to the Participant by the Company. 
 The number of Shares withheld and cancelled to pay a Participant's Withholding Taxes will be rounded up to the nearest whole Share sufficient to satisfy such taxes, with cash being paid to the Participant in an amount equal to the amount by which the Fair Market Value of such Shares exceeds the Withholding Taxes. 
 (b)   U.S. Code Section 409A .  To the extent that the Committee determines that any Award granted under the Plan is subject to Code Section 409A, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions required by Code Section 409A.  To the extent applicable, the Plan and Award Agreements shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate (i) to exempt the Award from Code Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Award, or (ii) to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and related Department of Treasury guidance and thereby avoid the application of any penalty taxes under such Section. 
   (c)   Unfunded Tax Status .  The Plan is intended to be an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation.  With respect to any payments not yet made to a Person pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award Agreement shall give the Person any rights that are  
 -15- 

greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate, and a Participant's rights under the Plan at all times constitute an unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company for the collection of benefits as they come due.  Neither the Participant nor the Participant's duly-authorized transferee or Beneficiaries shall have any claim against or rights in any specific assets, Shares, or other funds of the Company.  
 12.   Non-Transferability of Awards .   
 (a)   General .  Except as set forth in this Section, or as otherwise approved by the Committee, Awards may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution.  The designation of a death Beneficiary by a Participant will not constitute a transfer.  An Award may be exercised, during the lifetime of the holder of an Award, only by such holder, by the duly-authorized legal representative of a holder who is Disabled, or by a transferee permitted by this Section. 
 (b)   Limited Transferability Rights .  The Committee may in its discretion provide in an Award Agreement that an Award in the form of a Non-ISO, Share-settled SAR, Restricted Shares, or Performance Shares may be transferred, on such terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate, either (i) by instrument to the Participant's "Immediate Family" (as defined below), (ii) by instrument to an inter vivos or testamentary trust (or other entity) in which the Award is to be passed to the Participant's designated beneficiaries, or (iii) by gift to charitable institutions.  Any transferee of the Participant's rights shall succeed and be subject to all of the terms of the applicable Award Agreement and the Plan.  " Immediate Family " means any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, and shall include adoptive relationships. 
 (c)   Death .  In the event of the death of a Participant, any outstanding Awards issued to the Participant shall automatically be transferred to the Participant's Beneficiary (or, if no Beneficiary is designated or surviving, to the person or persons to whom the Participant's rights under the Award pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution). 
 13.   Change in Capital Structure; Change in Control; Etc .   
   (a)   Changes in Capitalization .  The Committee shall equitably adjust the number of Shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the number of Shares that have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or that have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of an Award, as well as the exercise or other price per Share covered by each such outstanding Award, to reflect any increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock-split, reverse stock-split, stock dividend, combination, recapitalization or reclassification of the Shares, merger, consolidation, change in organization form, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company.  In the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee may provide in substitution for any or all outstanding Awards such alternative consideration (including cash or securities of any surviving entity) as it may in good faith determine to be equitable under the circumstances and may require in connection therewith the surrender of all Awards so replaced.  In any case, such substitution of cash or securities shall  
 -16- 

not require the consent of any person who is granted Awards pursuant to the Plan.  Except as expressly provided herein, or in an Award Agreement, if the Company issues for consideration shares of stock of any class or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, the issuance shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be required to be made with respect to the number or price of Shares subject to any Award.  
 (b)   Dissolution or Liquidation .  In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the Company other than as part of a Change of Control, each Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such dissolution or liquidation, subject to the ability of the Committee to exercise any discretion authorized in the case of a Change in Control. 
 (c)   Change in Control .  In the event of a Change in Control but subject to the terms of any Award Agreements or employment-related agreements between the Company or any Affiliates and any Participant, each outstanding Award shall be assumed or a substantially equivalent award shall be substituted by the surviving or successor company or a parent or subsidiary of such successor company (in each case, the " Successor Company ") upon consummation of the transaction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, instead of having outstanding Awards be assumed or replaced with equivalent awards by the Successor Company, the Committee may in its sole and absolute discretion and authority, without obtaining the approval or consent of the Company's stockholders or any Participant with respect to his or her outstanding Awards, take one or more of the following actions (with respect to any or all of the Awards, and with discretion to differentiate between individual Participants and Awards for any reason): 
 (i)  accelerate the vesting of Awards so that Awards shall vest (and, to the extent applicable, become exercisable) as to the Shares that otherwise would have been unvested and provide that repurchase rights of the Company with respect to Shares issued pursuant to an Award shall lapse as to the Shares subject to such repurchase right; 
 (ii)  arrange or otherwise provide for the payment of cash or other consideration to Participants in exchange for the satisfaction and cancellation of outstanding Awards (with the Committee determining the amount payable to each Participant based on the Fair Market Value, on the date of the Change in Control, of the Award being cancelled, based on any reasonable valuation method selected by the Committee); 
 (iii)  terminate all or some Awards upon the consummation of the transaction, provided that the Committee shall provide for vesting of such Awards in full as of a date immediately prior to consummation of the Change in Control.  To the extent that an Award is not exercised prior to consummation of a transaction in which the Award is not being assumed or substituted, such Award shall terminate upon such consummation; 
 (iv)  make such other modifications, adjustments or amendments to outstanding Awards or this Plan as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate, subject however to the terms of Section 13 above. 
 -17- 

In the event the Administrator elects a method of payment that is intended to comply with Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv), the Administrator may provide that any payments that otherwise would be made after the five-year anniversary of the Change in Control Event shall be forfeited.  
 Unless otherwise expressly provided in an Award Agreement or in any employment-related agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant, in the event a Participant is Involuntarily Terminated on or within 12 months (or other period set forth in an Award Agreement) following a Change in Control, then any Award that is assumed or substituted pursuant to this Section shall accelerate and become fully vested (and become exercisable in full in the case of Options and SARs), and any repurchase right applicable to any Shares underlying the Award shall lapse in full.  The acceleration of vesting and lapse of repurchase rights provided for in the previous sentence shall occur immediately prior to the effective date of the Participant's Involuntary Termination. 
 14.   Termination, Rescission and Recapture of Awards .   
 (a)  Each Award under the Plan is intended to align the Participant's long-term interests with those of the Company.  Accordingly, to the extent provided in an Award Agreement, the Company may terminate any outstanding, unexercised, unexpired, unpaid, or deferred Awards (" Termination "), rescind any exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to the Award (" Rescission "), or recapture any Shares (whether restricted or unrestricted) or proceeds from the Participant's sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Award (" Recapture "), if the Participant does not comply with the conditions of subsections (b), (c), and (e) hereof (collectively, the " Conditions "). 
 (b)  A Participant shall not, without the Company's prior written authorization, disclose to anyone outside the Company, or use in other than the Company's business, any proprietary or confidential information or material, as those or other similar terms are used in any applicable patent, confidentiality, inventions, secrecy, or other agreement between the Participant and the Company with regard to any such proprietary or confidential information or material. 
 (c)  Pursuant to any agreement between the Participant and the Company with regard to intellectual property (including but not limited to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions, developments, improvements, proprietary information, confidential business and personnel information), a Participant shall promptly disclose and assign to the Company or its designee all right, title, and interest in such intellectual property, and shall take all reasonable steps necessary to enable the Company to secure all right, title and interest in such intellectual property in the United States and in any foreign country. 
 (d)  Upon exercise, payment, or delivery of cash or Common Stock pursuant to an Award, the Participant shall certify on a form acceptable to the Company that he or she is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and, if a severance of Continuous Service has occurred for any reason, shall state the name and address of the Participant's then-current employer or any entity for which the Participant performs business services and the Participant's title, and shall identify any organization or business in which the Participant owns a greater-than-five-percent equity interest. 
 -18- 

(e)    If the Company determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that (i) a Participant has violated any of the Conditions or (ii) during his or her Continuous Service, or within one year after its termination for any reason, a Participant (x) has rendered services to or otherwise directly or indirectly engaged in or assisted, any organization or business that, in the judgment of the Company in its sole and absolute discretion, is or is working to become competitive with the Company; (y) has solicited any non-administrative employee of the Company to terminate employment with the Company; or (z) has engaged in activities which are materially prejudicial to or in conflict with the interests of the Company, including any breaches of fiduciary duty or the duty of loyalty, then the Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, impose a Termination, Rescission, and/or Recapture with respect to any or all of the Participant's relevant Awards, Shares, and the proceeds thereof.  
 (f)  Within ten days after receiving notice from the Company of any such activity described in Section 14(e) above, the Participant shall deliver to the Company the Shares acquired pursuant to the Award, or, if Participant has sold the Shares, the gain realized, or payment received as a result of the rescinded exercise, payment, or delivery; provided, that if the Participant returns Shares that the Participant purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Option (or the gains realized from the sale of such Common Stock), the Company shall promptly refund the exercise price, without earnings, that the Participant paid for the Shares.  Any payment by the Participant to the Company pursuant to this Section shall be made either in cash or by returning to the Company the number of Shares that the Participant received in connection with the rescinded exercise, payment, or delivery.  It shall not be a basis for Termination, Rescission or Recapture if after termination of a Participant's Continuous Service, the Participant purchases, as an investment or otherwise, stock or other securities of such an organization or business, so long as (i) such stock or other securities are listed upon a recognized securities exchange or traded over-the-counter, and (ii) such investment does not represent more than a five percent (5%) equity interest in the organization or business. 
 (g)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the Company has sole and absolute discretion not to require Termination, Rescission and/or Recapture, and its determination not to require Termination, Rescission and/or Recapture with respect to any particular act by a particular Participant or Award shall not in any way reduce or eliminate the Company's authority to require Termination, Rescission and/or Recapture with respect to any other act or Participant or Award.  Nothing in this Section shall be construed to impose obligations on the Participant to refrain from engaging in lawful competition with the Company after the termination of employment that does not violate subsections (b), (c), or (e) of this Section, other than any obligations that are part of any separate agreement between the Company and the Participant or that arise under Applicable Law. 
 (h)  All administrative and discretionary authority given to the Company under this Section shall be exercised by the most senior human resources executive of the Company or such other person or committee (including without limitation the Committee) as the Committee may designate from time to time. 
   (i)  If any provision within this Section is determined to be unenforceable or invalid under any Applicable Law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its  
 -19- 

objectives and any limitations required under Applicable Law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to any contrary terms set forth in any Award Agreement, this Section shall not be applicable to any Participant from and after his or her termination of Continuous Service after a Change in Control.  
 15.   Recoupment of Awards .  Unless otherwise specifically provided in an Award Agreement, and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Committee may in its sole and absolute discretion, without obtaining the approval or consent of the Company's stockholders or of any Participant, require that any Participant reimburse the Company for all or any portion of any Awards granted under this Plan (" Reimbursement "), or the Committee may require the Termination or Rescission of, or the Recapture associated with, any Award, if and to the extent   
 (a)  the granting, vesting, or payment of such Award was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a material financial restatement; 
 (b)  in the Committee's view the Participant either benefited from a calculation that later proves to be materially inaccurate, or engaged in fraud or misconduct that caused or partially caused the need for a material financial restatement by the Company or any Affiliate; and 
 (c)  (a lower granting, vesting, or payment of such Award would have occurred based upon the conduct described in clause (b) of this Section. 
 In each instance, the Committee will, to the extent practicable and allowable under Applicable Laws, require Reimbursement, Termination or Rescission of, or Recapture relating to, any such Award granted to a Participant; provided that the Company will not seek Reimbursement, Termination or Rescission of, or Recapture relating to, any such Awards that were paid or vested more than three years prior to the first date of the applicable restatement period. 
 16.   Relationship to other Benefits .  No payment pursuant to the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Affiliate except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder. 
 17.   Administration of the Plan .  The Committee shall administer the Plan in accordance with its terms, provided that the Board may act in lieu of the Committee on any matter.  The Committee shall hold meetings at such times and places as it may determine and may prescribe, amend, and rescind such rules, regulations, and procedures for the conduct of its business as it deems advisable.  In the absence of a duly appointed Committee, the Board shall function as the Committee for all purposes of the Plan. 
 (a)   Committee Composition .  The Board shall appoint the members of the Committee.  If and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Committee may authorize one or more executive officers to make Awards to Eligible Persons other than themselves.  The Board may at any time appoint additional members to the Committee, remove and replace members of the Committee with or without Cause, and fill vacancies on the Committee however caused. 
 -20- 

(b)    Powers of the Committee  .  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion:  
 (i)  to grant Awards and to determine Eligible Persons to whom Awards shall be granted from time to time, and the number of Shares, units, or dollars to be covered by each Award; 
 (ii)  to determine, from time to time, the Fair Market Value of Shares; 
 (iii)  to determine, and to set forth in Award Agreements, the terms and conditions of all Awards, including any applicable exercise or purchase price, the installments and conditions under which an Award shall become vested (which may be based on performance), terminated, expired, cancelled, or replaced, and the circumstances for vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and other restrictions and limitations; 
 (iv)  to approve the forms of Award Agreements and all other documents, notices and certificates in connection therewith which need not be identical either as to type of Award or among Participants; 
 (v)  to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and any Award Agreement, to determine the meaning of their terms, and to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and procedures relating to the Plan and its administration; 
 (vi)  to the extent consistent with the purposes of the Plan and without amending the Plan, to modify, to cancel, or to waive the Company's rights with respect to any Awards, to adjust or to modify Award Agreements for changes in Applicable Law, and to recognize differences in foreign law, tax policies, or customs; 
 (vii)  to require, as a condition precedent to the grant, vesting, exercise, settlement, and/or issuance of Shares pursuant to any Award, that a Participant agree to execute a general release of claims (in any form that the Committee may require, in its sole discretion, which form may include any other provisions, e.g. confidentiality and restrictions on competition, that are found in general claims release agreements that the Company utilizes or expects to utilize); 
 (viii)  in the event that the Company establishes, for itself or using the services of a third party, an automated system for the documentation, granting, settlement, or exercise of Award, such as a system using an internet website or interactive voice response, to implement paperless documentation, granting, settlement, or exercise of Awards by a Participant may be permitted through the use of such an automated system; and 
 (ix)  to make all interpretations and to take all other actions that the Committee may consider necessary or advisable to administer the Plan or to effectuate its purposes. 
 -21- 

Subject to Applicable Law and the restrictions set forth in the Plan, the Committee may delegate administrative functions to individuals who are Directors or Employees.  
 (c)   Local Law Adjustments and Sub-plans .  To facilitate the making of any grant of an Award under this Plan, the Committee may adopt rules and provide for such special terms for Awards to Participants who are located within the United States, foreign nationals, or who are employed by the Company or any Affiliate outside of the United States of America as the Committee may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy or custom.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Company is specifically authorized to adopt rules and procedures regarding the conversion of local currency, taxes, withholding procedures and handling of stock certificates which vary with the customs and requirements of particular countries.  The Company may adopt sub- plans and establish escrow accounts and trusts, and settle Awards in cash in lieu of shares, as may be appropriate, required or applicable to particular locations and countries. 
 (d)   Action by Committee .  Unless otherwise established by the Board or in any charter of the Committee, a majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum and the acts of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present, and acts approved in writing by all members of the Committee in lieu of a meeting, shall be deemed the acts of the Committee.  Each member of the Committee is entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to that member by an officer or other employee of the Company or any Affiliate, the Company's independent certified public accounts, or any executive compensation consultant or other professional retained by the Company to assist in the administration of the Plan. 
 (e)   Deference to Committee Determinations .  The Committee shall have the discretion to interpret or construe ambiguous, unclear, or implied (but omitted) terms in any fashion it deems to be appropriate in its sole discretion, and to make any findings of fact needed in the administration of the Plan or Award Agreements.  The Committee's prior exercise of its discretionary authority shall not obligate it to exercise its authority in a like fashion thereafter.  The Committee's interpretation and construction of any provision of the Plan, or of any Award or Award Agreement, and all determination the Committee makes pursuant to the Plan shall be final, binding, and conclusive.  The validity of any such interpretation, construction, decision or finding of fact shall not be given de novo review if challenged in court, by arbitration, or in any other forum, and shall be upheld unless clearly made in bad faith or materially affected by fraud. 
 (f)   No Liability; Indemnification .  Neither the Board nor any Committee member, nor any Person acting at the direction of the Board or the Committee, shall be liable for any act, omission, interpretation, construction or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement.  The Company and its Affiliates shall pay or reimburse any member of the Committee, as well as any Director, Employee, or Consultant who in good faith takes action on behalf of the Plan, for all expenses incurred with respect to the Plan, and to the full extent allowable under Applicable Law shall indemnify each and every one of them for any claims, liabilities, and costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising out of their good faith performance of duties on behalf of the Plan.  The Company and its Affiliates may, but shall not be required to, obtain liability insurance for this purpose. 
 -22- 

(g)    Expenses  .  The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne jointly and severally by the Company and its Affiliates.  
 18.   Modification of Awards and Substitution of Options .  Within the limitations of the Plan, the Committee may modify an Award to accelerate the rate at which an Option or SAR may be exercised, to accelerate the vesting of any Award, to extend or renew outstanding Awards, to accept the cancellation of outstanding Awards to the extent not previously exercised, or to make any change that the Plan would permit for a new Award.  However, except in connection with a Change in Control or as approved by the Company's stockholders for any period during which it is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Committee may not cancel an outstanding Option or SAR whose exercise price is greater than Fair Market Value at the time of cancellation for the purpose of reissuing the Option or SAR to the Participant at a lower exercise price, or granting a replacement award of a different type, or otherwise allowing for a "repricing" within the meaning of applicable federal securities laws.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no modification of an outstanding Award may materially and adversely affect a Participant's rights thereunder unless either (i) the Participant provides written consent to the modification, or (ii) before a Change in Control, the Committee determines in good faith that the modification is not materially adverse to the Participant. 
 19.   Plan Amendment and Termination .  The Board may amend or terminate the Plan as it shall deem advisable; provided that no change shall be made that increases the total number of Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to Awards (except pursuant to Section 13 above) unless such change is authorized by the stockholders of the Company.  A termination or amendment of the Plan shall not materially and adversely affect a Participant's vested rights under an Award previously granted to him or her, unless the Participant consents in writing to such termination or amendment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may amend the Plan to comply with changes in tax or securities laws or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof.  Furthermore, neither the Company nor the Committee shall, without stockholder approval, either (a) allow for a "repricing" within the meaning of federal securities laws applicable to proxy statement disclosures, or (b) cancel an outstanding Option whose exercise price is greater than Fair Market Value at the time of cancellation for the purpose of reissuing the Option to the Participant at a lower exercise price or granting a replacement award of a different type. 
 20.   Term of Plan .  If not sooner terminated by the Board, this Plan shall terminate at the close of business on the date ten years after its Effective Date as determined under Section 1(b) above.  No Awards shall be made under the Plan after its termination. 
 21.   Governing Law .  The terms of this Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, within the United States of America, without regard to the State's conflict of laws rules. 
 22.   Laws and Regulations .   
   (a)   General Rules .  This Plan, the granting of Awards, the exercise of Options and SARs, and the obligations of the Company hereunder (including those to pay cash or to deliver, sell or accept the surrender of any of its Shares or other securities) shall be subject to all Applicable Law.  In the event that any Shares are not registered under any Applicable Law prior

For the purposes of this definition, "control," when used with respect to any Person, means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person or the power to elect directors, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms "affiliated," "controlling" and "controlled" have meanings correlative to the foregoing. 
 " Applicable Law " means the legal requirements relating to the administration of options and share-based plans under any applicable laws of the United States, any other country, and any provincial, state, or local subdivision, any applicable stock exchange or automated quotation system rules or regulations, as such laws, rules, regulations and requirements shall be in place from time to time. 
 " Award " means any award made pursuant to the Plan, including awards made in the form of an Option, a SAR, a Restricted Share, a RSU, an Unrestricted Share, a DSU, a Performance Award, or Dividend Equivalent Rights, or any combination thereof, whether alternative or cumulative. 
 " Award Agreement " means any written document setting forth the terms of an Award that has been authorized by the Committee.  The Committee shall determine the form or forms of documents to be used, and may change them from time to time for any reason. 
 " Beneficiary " means the person or entity designated by the Participant, in a form approved by the Company, to exercise the Participant's rights with respect to an Award or receive payment or settlement under an Award after the Participant's death.

   " Cause " has the meaning set forth in any unexpired employment agreement between the Company and the Participant.  In the absence of such an agreement, "Cause" means (i) gross negligence, willful misconduct, insubordination, or other material malfeasance or non-feasance by the Participant in the performance of his duties; (ii) the Participant's unauthorized disclosure of confidential information about the Company; (iii) the Participant's material breach of any employment, consulting, confidentiality, non-disclosure, non-competition or similar agreement between the Participant and the Company; (iv) the Participant's conviction of, plea of nolo contendere to, or written admission of the commission of, a felony; (v) any act by the Participant involving fraud or misrepresentation with respect to his duties for the Company, which has resulted or likely will result in material damage to the Company; (vi) any act by the Participant constituting a failure to follow the directions of the either the Company's Chief Executive Officer

For purpose of this paragraph, no act or failure to act by the Participant shall be considered "willful" if such act or failure to act was in good faith and with the reasonable belief that the act or omission was in the best interests of the Company, or occurred at the direction of the Board.  The foregoing definition does not in any way limit the Company's ability to terminate a Participant's employment or consulting relationship at any time, and the term "Company" will be interpreted herein to include any Affiliate or successor thereto, if appropriate.  Furthermore, a Participant's Continuous Service shall be deemed to have terminated for Cause within the meaning hereof if, at any time (whether before, on, or after termination of the Participant's Continuous Service), facts or circumstances are discovered that would have justified a termination for Cause.

During any consecutive two-year period commencing after the date of adoption of this Plan, individuals who constituted the Board at the beginning of the period (or their approved replacements, as defined in the next sentence) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the Board.  A new Director shall be considered an "approved replacement" Director if his or her election (or nomination for election) was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the Directors then still in office who either were Directors at the beginning of the period or were themselves approved replacement Directors, but in either case excluding any Director whose initial assumption of office occurred as a result of an actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of any Person other than the Board. 
 A-2 

(iii)    Merger  .  The Company consummates a merger, or consolidation of the Company with the any other corporation unless: (a) the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately before the merger or consolidation would continue to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) at least 50 % of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; and (b) no Person (other than Persons who are Employees at any time more than one year before the transaction) becomes the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 50 % or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities.

Changes in status between service as an Employee, Director, and a Consultant will not constitute an interruption of Continuous Service if the individual continues to perform bona fide services for the Company.  The Committee shall have the discretion to determine whether and to what extent the vesting of any Awards shall be tolled during any paid or unpaid leave of absence; provided, however, that in the absence of such determination, vesting for all Awards shall be tolled during any such unpaid leave (but not for a paid leave).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, an Investor Director Provider shall be deemed to have Continuous Service for so long as the Investor Director Provider makes available for service as a member of the Board at least one individual who provides services to, owns equity interests in, or is otherwise employed by, such investor or any of its Affiliates.
