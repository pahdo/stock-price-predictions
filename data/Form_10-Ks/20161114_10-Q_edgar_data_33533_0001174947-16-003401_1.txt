    Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)  

 Note 1. Basis of Presentation 

 In the opinion of management the accompanying
unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation
of the results for such periods. The results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the full fiscal year. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those
related to revenue recognition, inventories, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the Company's most recent audited financial statements included in its report on Form 10-K for the year
ended June 30, 2016. Certain reclassifications may have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current
year presentation. 

 Note 2. Investment Securities and
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that
the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.   

Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated
by observable market data.   

Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions
about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.   

 The carrying amounts of financial instruments,
including cash and cash equivalents, short term investment securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses,
approximated fair value as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial
instruments. 

 Investment securities at September 30,
2016 and June 30, 2016 consist of certificates of deposit and municipal bonds which are classified as available-for-sale securities
and have been determined to be level 1 assets. The cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value of available-for-sale
securities by major security type at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 are as follows: 

The portfolio is diversified and highly
liquid and primarily consists of investment grade fixed income instruments. At September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any
investments in individual securities that have been in a continuous loss position considered to be other than temporary. 

4   

      Index  

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30,
2016, the contractual maturities of available-for-sale securities were as follows: 

Note 3. Net Income per Share 

 Basic net income per share excludes dilution
and is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts
to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared
in the income of the Company. The computation of weighted-average common shares outstanding, assuming dilution, excluded options
to purchase 34,750 and 69,300 shares of our common stock for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015,
respectively, as the effect of including them would be anti-dilutive. As Unearned ESOP shares are released or committed-to-be-released
the shares become outstanding for earnings-per-share computations. 

 Note 4. Stock Based Compensation 

  The
Company follows ASC 718 in establishing standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments
for goods or services, as well as transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are
based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments.
ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based
on the fair value of the share-based payment. ASC 718 establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based
payment transactions with employees, except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans.   

 Total stock-based compensation expense
recognized in the statements of comprehensive income for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $23,333
and $30,466, respectively, before income taxes. The related total deferred tax benefits were approximately $1,765 and $2,676 for
the same periods. ASC 718 requires the tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized
for those options to be classified and reported as both an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow. 

 As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately
$61,752 of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards that is expected to be recognized as expense over the
next 1.75 years. The total deferred tax benefit related to these awards is approximately $5,001. 

 The Company has one employee stock option
plan under which options may be granted, the 2007 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the  2007 Plan ). The Board
of Directors may grant options to acquire shares of common stock to employees of the Company at the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of grant. Generally, options granted have a two-year vesting period based on two years of continuous service
and have a ten-year contractual life. Option grants provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control. Shares issued
upon the exercise of options are from those held in Treasury. The 2007 Plan was approved by the Company's shareholders at the Company's
Annual Meeting on November 30, 2007 and supersedes the Company's 2000 Stock Option Plan (the  2000 Plan ). Options covering
400,000 shares are authorized for issuance under the 2007 Plan, of which 237,150 have been granted and 162,250 are outstanding
as of September 30, 2016. While no further grants of options may be made under the 2000 Plan, as of September 30, 2016, 7,200 options
remain outstanding, vested and exercisable from the 2000 Plan. 

 ASC 718 requires the use of a valuation
model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option valuation model,
which incorporates various assumptions including those for volatility, expected life and interest rates. 

 There were no options awarded for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

 The Company declares dividends quarterly
and paid cash dividends totaling $0.25 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and declared a cash dividend totaling $0.25
for the three months ended September 30, 2015 which was paid in the subsequent quarter. Our Board of Directors assesses the Company s
dividend policy periodically. There is no assurance that the Board of Directors will either maintain the amount of the regular
cash dividend or declare a special dividend during any future years. Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical
volatility of the Company s stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues
with an equivalent term approximating the expected life of the options. The expected option life (in years) represents the estimated
period of time until exercise and is based on actual historical experience.

The following table summarizes stock
option activity during the three months ended September 30, 2016: 

The aggregate intrinsic value in the
table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the closing sale price of the Company s common
stock as reported on the NYSE MKT on September 30, 2016 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options)
that would have been received by the option holders if all option holders had exercised their options on September 30, 2016. This
amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company s common stock. The total intrinsic values of the options exercised
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0 and $6,512, respectively. 

 The following table summarizes changes in non-vested stock
options during the three months ended September 30, 2016: 

Note 5. Commitments and Contingencies 

 The Company at certain times enters into
standby letters of credit agreements with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain
contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding standby letters of credit agreements aggregated to zero at September 30, 2016
and 2015. The Company, as a U.S. Government contractor, is subject to audits, reviews, and investigations by the U.S. Government
related to its negotiation and performance of government contracts and its accounting for such contracts. Failure to comply with
applicable U.S. Government standards by a contractor may result in suspension from eligibility for award of any new government
contract and a guilty plea or conviction may result in debarment from eligibility for awards. The government may, in certain cases,
also terminate existing contracts, recover damages, and impose other sanctions and penalties. 

 Note 6. Recently Issued Accounting
Standards 

 In July 2015, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic
330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  ASU No. 2015-11 requires inventory measured using any method other than
last-in, first out or the retail inventory method to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, rather
than at the lower of cost or market. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price, less the estimated costs to
complete, dispose, and transport such inventory. ASU No. 2015-11 will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2016. ASU No. 2015-11 is required to be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted. The Company s
adoption of ASU No. 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.

      Index  

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,    which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance
under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services.
ASU No. 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be
required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. 

 In subsequent periods, the FASB issued
additional ASUs intended to clarify specific aspects related to the interpretation and implementation of ASU No. 2014-09. In March
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers   Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  to provide guidance on principal versus agent considerations by an entity as discussed
in ASU No. 2014-09. ASU No. 2016-08 provides criteria to be assessed by an entity when determining whether it is the principal
or agent in relation to the goods or services which the company is contractually obligated to provide to the customer. Among these
considerations are  identifying the unit of account at which the entity should assess whether it is a principal or an agent,
identifying the nature of the good or service provided to the customer  applying the control principle to certain types of
transactions  and, interaction of the control principle with the indicators provided to assist in the principle versus agent
evaluation. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606): Identifying
Performance Obligations and Licensing  to provide implementation guidance related to the necessary judgements required in
identifying performance obligations of a contract and guidance related to recognition of licensing revenues. In May 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical
Expedients  to provide guidance related to the implementation of ASU No. 2014-09 in the following areas  assessing collectability
for contracts that do not meet Step 1 of revenue recognition, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, contract modifications
at transition, and completed contracts at transition. 

 These standards are effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a
full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect
certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU No. 2014-09
recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). Early adoption is permitted for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods therein. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of
ASU No. 2014-09 on our financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in fiscal
2019. 

 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The guidance requires the
classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The current requirement that
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a taxpaying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected
by this update. ASU No. 2015-17 will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
those annual periods. ASU No. 2015-17 may be applied prospectively or retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. Adoption
of ASU No. 2015-17 would have the following impact on the Company s financial statements at September 30, 2016  a decrease
in current assets of $239,898, a decrease in noncurrent liabilities of $202,711 and an increase in noncurrent assets of $37,187. 

 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities . The amendments in this Update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and
disclosure of financial instruments (primarily equity securities) in order to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments
to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. ASU No. 2016-01 will be effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is evaluating the impact that ASU
No. 2016-01 will have on the Company's financial statements. 

 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
The areas for simplification in this update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including
the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash
flows. Additionally, this ASU allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that
are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures as they occur. ASU No. 2016-09 will be effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. ASU No. 2016-09 may be applied prospectively
or retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on the
Company's financial statements.

Note 7.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan 

 The Company sponsors
a leveraged employee stock ownership plan (the  ESOP ) that covers all non-union employees who work 1,000 or more hours
per year and are employed on June 30. The Company makes annual contributions to the ESOP equal to the ESOP's debt service less
dividends on unallocated shares received by the ESOP. All dividends on unallocated shares received by the ESOP are used to pay
debt service. Dividends on allocated ESOP shares are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. As the debt is repaid, shares
are released and allocated to active employees, based on the proportion of debt service paid in the year. The Company accounts
for its ESOP in accordance with FASB ASC 718-40. Accordingly, the shares purchased by the ESOP are reported as Unearned ESOP shares
in the statement of financial position. As shares are released or committed-to-be-released, the Company reports compensation expense
equal to the current average market price of the shares, and the shares become outstanding for earnings-per-share (EPS) computations.
ESOP compensation expense was $108,709 and $113,094 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The ESOP shares as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not repurchase any shares held by the ESOP.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Overview 

 Espey Mfg.   Electronics Corp. ( Espey )
is a power electronics design and original equipment manufacturing (OEM) company with a long history of developing and delivering
highly reliable products for use in military and severe environment applications. Design, manufacturing, and testing is performed
in our 150,000+ square foot facility located at 233 Ballston Ave, Saratoga Springs, New York. Espey is classified as a  smaller
reporting company  for purposes of the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Espey s
common stock is publicly-traded on the NYSE MKT under the symbol  ESP.  

 Espey began operations after incorporation
in New York in 1928. We strive to remain competitive as a leader in high power energy conversion and transformer solutions through
the design and manufacture of new and improved products by using advanced and  cutting edge  electronics technologies. 

 Espey is ISO 9001:2008 and AS9100:2009
certified. Our primary products are power supplies, power converters, filters, power transformers, magnetic components, power distribution
equipment, UPS systems, antennas and high power radar systems. The applications of these products include AC and DC locomotives,
shipboard power, shipboard radar, airborne power, ground-based radar, and ground mobile power. 

 Espey services include design and development
to specification, build to print, design services, design studies, environmental testing services, metal fabrication, painting
services, and development of automatic testing equipment. Espey is vertically integrated, meaning that the Company produces individual
components (including inductors), populates printed circuit boards, fabricates metalwork, paints, wires, qualifies, and fully tests
items, mechanically, electrically and environmentally, in house. Portions of the manufacturing and testing process may be subcontracted
to vendors. 

 The Company markets its products primarily
through its own direct sales organization and through outside sales representatives. Business is solicited from large industrial
manufacturers and defense companies, the government of the United States, foreign governments and major foreign electronic equipment
companies. In certain countries the Company has external sales representatives to help solicit and coordinate foreign contracts.
Espey is also on the eligible list of contractors with the United States Department of Defense and generally is automatically solicited
by Defense Department procurement agencies for their needs falling within the major classes of products produced by the Company.
In addition, the Company directly pursues opportunities from the United States Department of Defense for prime contracts. Espey
contracts with the Federal Government under cage code 20950 as Espey Mfg.   Electronics Corp. 

 There is competition in all classes of
products manufactured by the Company from divisions of the largest electronic companies, as well as many small companies. The Company's
sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products. The principal methods of competition
for electronic products of both a military and industrial nature include, among other factors, price, product performance, the
experience of the particular company and history of its dealings in such products. 

 Our business is not seasonal. However,
the concentration of our business in the rail industry, and in equipment for military applications including our customer concentrations,
expose us to on-going associated risks including, without limitation, dependence on appropriations from the United States Government
and the governments of foreign nations, program allocations, the potential of governmental termination of orders for convenience,
and the general health of our largest customers. 

 Uncertainty in federal defense spending
and the current decline in the rail industry continues to drive competition. Many of our competitors have been aggressively investing
in upfront product design costs and lowering profit margins as a strategic means of maintaining existing business and enhancing
market share at the expense of short term profit. This change in the market place has put pressure on the pricing of our current
products and will result in lower margins on new business and some of our legacy business. In order to compete effectively for
new business, in some cases we invest in upfront design costs, thereby reducing initial profitability as a means of procuring new
long-term programs. Accordingly, we have adjusted our pricing strategy in order to achieve a balance which enables us both to retain
repeat programs while being more competitive in bidding on new programs. This trend will continue in the current fiscal year as
we continue to invest in new programs and aggressively quote long-term programs in an effort to grow the business. 

 In order to maintain a balanced business,
we are currently putting emphasis on securing  build to print  opportunities, which will allow production work to go
directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff. This effort will keep our manufacturing team
busy while the products being developed transition to production over the next six to eighteen months.

The Company's backlog was approximately
$34.2 million at September 30, 2016 which includes $22.5 million from two significant customers compared to $33.6 million at September
30, 2015 which included $20.5 million from two significant customers. The backlog for the Company represents the estimated remaining
sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by Congress
and/or funded by the customer. The unfunded portions of the backlog at September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0. While there is no guarantee
that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, management includes in unfunded backlog only those
programs that it believes are likely to receive funding based on discussions with customers and program status. 

 Management expects
revenues in fiscal year 2017 to be less than revenues during fiscal 2016. This is primarily due to a decline we are experiencing
in our industrial sector. As reported in our report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, a significant customer
in the rail market advised us of its expectations for a scaled-back purchase plan due to falling demand for locomotives. For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, shipments to this significant customer declined by 41% as compared with the same period
in 2015. We are working closely with our rail industry partners to secure long-term agreements that will allow us to support them
through this downturn and provide a resumption of business for the Company upon a rail industry recovery. The anticipated sales
decline in the rail industry may be offset, in part, by a new product for a customer in the military market which is currently
in the final stages of design development and qualification testing. If the testing is successful, shipments of the product are
expected to begin in the third quarter of the fiscal year. 

 In order to address
the downturn in the rail market and its impact on future sales and income, we have also launched two additional military power
supply designs in fiscal 2016, each for a different customer. All designs have progressed through critical design and have proceeded
into qualification testing. We expect these new products to have significant multi-year production runs post qualification. 

 New orders received
in the first three months of fiscal 2017 were approximately $1.2 million as compared to $3.4 million of new orders received in
the first three months of fiscal 2016. It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $17 million of orders comprising the September
30, 2016 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. The minimum of $17 million does not include any shipments,
which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. The estimate of the September
30, 2016 backlog to be shipped in fiscal 2017 is subject to future events, which may cause the amount of the backlog actually shipped
to differ from such estimate. 

 In addition to the backlog, the Company
currently has outstanding opportunities representing in excess of $59.7 million in the aggregate as of November 9, 2016 for both
repeat and new programs .  The outstanding quotations encompass various new and previously manufactured power supplies, transformers,
and subassemblies. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any of the anticipated orders described above,
many of which are subject to allocations of the United States defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry and industrial
locomotive power supply procurement generally. 

 Net sales to four significant customers
represented 68.4% of the Company's total sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, and net sales to two significant
customers represented 60.4% of the Company s total sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. This high concentration
level with these customers presents significant risk. A loss of one of these customers or programs related to these customers could
significantly impact the Company. Historically, a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company s
total sales in any given fiscal year. Management continues to pursue opportunities with current and new customers with an overall
objective of lowering the concentration of sales and mitigating excessive reliance upon a single major product of a particular
program or minimizing the impact of the loss of a single significant customer. 

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

 Management believes our most critical
accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on our contracts. 

 A significant portion of our business
is comprised of development and production contracts. Generally revenues on long-term fixed-price contracts are recorded on a percentage
of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. 

 Percentage of completion accounting requires
judgment relative to expected sales, estimating costs and making assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedules.
Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of overhead costs. The estimation of cost at completion
of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the
contract. Given the significance of the estimation processes and judgments described above, it is possible that materially different
amounts of expected sales and contract costs could be recorded if different assumptions were used, based on changes in circumstances,
in the estimation process. When a change in expected sales value or estimated cost is determined, changes are reflected in current
period earnings.

Results of Operations 

 Net sales decreased for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 to $6,068,684 as compared to $6,279,436 for the same period in 2015. The decrease in net sales is primarily
due to a decrease in power supply and build to print sales offset by an increase in magnetic shipments. 

 For the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 gross profits were $1,343,748 and $1,968,320, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 22.1% and
31.3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The primary factors in determining gross profit and
net income are overall sales levels and product mix. The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically
higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production. In the case
of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as  loss contracts,  meaning engineering design contracts in
which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales. In any given accounting period the mix of product
shipments between higher margin programs and less mature programs, and expenditures associated with loss contracts, has a significant
impact on gross profit and net income. The gross profit percentage decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to September 30, 2015 primarily due to product mix and an increase in expenditures related to engineering design investments, specifically,
one of the military power supplies discussed above. The design investment resulted in a 3% decline in the gross profit percentage. 

 Selling, general and administrative expenses
were $772,667 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $23,017, compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 relates primarily to an increase in compensation costs due
to an increase in number of employees. 

 Other income for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $19,023 and $25,441, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in scrap metal sales. 

 The effective income tax rate at September
30, 2016 and 2015 was 28.7% and 29.4%, respectively. The effective tax rate is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the
benefit the Company receives on its  qualified production activities  under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
and the benefit derived from the ESOP dividends paid on allocated shares. 

 Net income for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, was $420,825 or $0.18 per share, both basic and diluted, compared to $878,530 or $0.38 per share, both basic
and diluted, respectively for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net income per share was mainly due to
lower gross profit resulting from product mix and the increase in expenditures related to engineering design investments made by
the company. 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 The Company's working capital is an appropriate
indicator of the liquidity of its business, and during the past two fiscal years, the Company, when possible, has funded all of
its operations with cash flows resulting from operating activities and when necessary from its existing cash and investments. The
Company did not borrow any funds during the last two fiscal years. Management has available a $3,000,000 line of credit to help
fund further growth or working capital and letter of credit needs, if necessary, but does not anticipate the need for any borrowed
funds in the foreseeable future. Contingent liabilities on outstanding standby letters of credit agreements aggregated to zero
at September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

 The Company's working capital as of
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $30.1 million and $29.1 million, respectively. During the three-month period
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock from the Company's Employee
Retirement Plan and Trust ( ESOP ). Under existing authorizations from the Company's Board of Directors, as of
September 30, 2016, management is authorized to purchase an additional $1,030,326 of Company stock. 

 The table below presents the summary
of cash flow information for the fiscal years indicated: 

11   

      Index  

Net cash provided by operating activities
fluctuates between periods primarily as a result of differences in sales and net income, provisions for income taxes, the timing
of the collection of accounts receivable, purchase of inventory, and payment of accounts payable .  The decrease primarily
relates to a decrease in net income, the timing of cash collections on accounts receivable offset by the timing of inventory purchases.
Net cash used by investing activities increased in the first three months of fiscal 2017 due to an increase in the purchase of
investment securities. The increase in cash used in financing activities is due primarily to the fact that no stock options were
exercised in the current quarter. 

 The Company currently believes that the
cash flow generated from operations and when necessary, from cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its long-term
funding requirements for the foreseeable future. 

 During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company expended $155,730 and $5,751, respectively, for plant improvements and new equipment. The Company
has budgeted approximately $750,000 for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal 2017. Management anticipates that the funds
required will be available from current operations. 

 Management also believes that the Company's
reserve for bad debts of $3,000 is adequate given the customers with whom the Company does business. Historically, bad debt expense
has been minimal.
