Note 1   Organization 
  American Realty Capital New York City REIT, Inc. (including, as required by context, New York City Operating Partnership L.P., and its subsidiaries, the  Company ) was incorporated on December 19, 2013 as a Maryland corporation and elected and qualified to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ( REIT ) beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2014. On April 24, 2014, the Company commenced its initial public offering (the "IPO") on a "reasonable best efforts" basis of up to   30.0 million   shares of common stock,   $0.01   par value per share, at a price of   $25.00   per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, for total gross proceeds of up to   $750.0 million  , pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11, as amended (File No.   333-194135  ) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Registration Statement also covered up to   10.5 million   shares available pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the "DRIP") under which the Company's common stockholders could elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Company's common stock at a price of   $23.75   per share, which is equal to   95%   of the offering price in the IPO. 
  On May 29, 2014, the Company received and accepted subscriptions in excess of the minimum offering amount for the IPO of   $2.0 million   in shares, broke general escrow and issued shares of common stock to initial investors who were admitted as stockholders of the Company. In February 2015, as permitted, the Company reallocated the remaining   10.0 million   DRIP shares available under the Registration Statement to the primary offering. On May 22, 2015, the Company registered an additional   25.0 million   shares to be issued pursuant to the DRIP pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-204433). The Company closed its IPO on May 31, 2015, and continued to accept subscriptions in process as of that date. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   30.6 million   shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares and shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, and had received total gross proceeds from the IPO and DRIP of   $759.8 million  , inclusive of   $41.0 million   from the DRIP and net of repurchases.  
  On October 24, 2016, the Company's board of directors approved an estimated net asset value per share of the Company's common stock ("Estimated Per-Share NAV") as of June 30, 2016, which was published on October 26, 2016 ("NAV Pricing Date"). The Company intends to publish subsequent valuations of Estimated Per-Share NAV periodically at the discretion of the Company's board of directors, provided that such valuations will be made at least once annually. Until the NAV Pricing Date, the Company offered shares pursuant to the DRIP and has repurchased shares pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program ("SRP") at a price based on   $23.75   per share, the offering price in the IPO. Beginning with the NAV Pricing Date, the Company began to offer shares pursuant to the DRIP and repurchase shares pursuant to its SRP at a price based on Estimated Per-Share NAV.  
  The Company was formed to invest its assets in properties in the five boroughs of New York City, with a focus on Manhattan. The Company may also purchase for investment purposes certain real estate investment assets that accompany office properties, including retail spaces and amenities, as well as hospitality assets, residential assets and other property types exclusively in New York City. All such properties may be acquired and owned by the Company alone or jointly with another party. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   six   properties consisting of   1,091,571   rentable square feet. 
  Substantially all of the Company s business is conducted through New York City Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the  OP ). The Company has   no   employees. New York City Advisors, LLC (the "Advisor") manages the Company's affairs on a day-to-day basis. New York City Properties, LLC (the  Property Manager ) manages our properties, unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties. The Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global Investments, LLC (the successor business to AR Capital, LLC, "AR Global"), the parent of the Company's sponsor, American Realty Capital III, LLC (the "Sponsor"), as a result of which they are related parties, and each of these entities has received or will receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to the IPO and the investment and management of the Company's assets. The Advisor, New York City Special Limited Partner, LLC (the "Special Limited Partner"), which is also under common control with AR Global, and the Property Manager have also received or will also receive fees, distributions and other compensation during the offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages.

The Company is the sole general partner and holds substantially all of the units of limited partner interests in the OP ( OP Units ). The Advisor contributed   $2,020   to the OP in exchange for   90   OP Units, which represents a nominal percentage of the aggregate OP ownership. A holder of OP Units has the right to convert OP Units for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of the Company's common stock or, at the option of the OP, a corresponding number of shares of the Company's common stock, in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of the OP, provided, however, that such OP Units must have been outstanding for at least one year. The remaining rights of the limited partners in the OP are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP's assets. 
   
  Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company included herein were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The information furnished includes all adjustments and accruals of a normal recurring nature, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of results for the interim periods. The results of operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year or any subsequent interim period. 
  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which are included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 16, 2016. There have been no significant changes to the Company's significant accounting policies during   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , other than the updates described below: 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued revised guidance relating to revenue recognition. Under the revised guidance, an entity is required to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The revised guidance was to become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption was not permitted under GAAP. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the revised guidance by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although entities will be allowed to early adopt the guidance as of the original effective date. The revised guidance allows entities to apply the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method upon adoption. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an update which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. The new guidance requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The revised guidance supersedes previous leasing standards and is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise to provide goods or services to a customer is performed in a principal or agent capacity and to recognize revenue in a gross or net manner based on its principal/agent designation. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.

In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes how entities measure credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost. The update eliminates the requirement that a credit loss must be probable before it can be recognized and instead requires an entity to recognize the current estimate of all expected credit losses. Additionally, the update requires credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be carried as an allowance rather than as a direct write-down of the asset. The amendments become effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments may be adopted early for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance on how certain transactions should be classified and presented in the statement of cash flows as either operating, investing or financing activities. Among other things, the update provides specific guidance on where to classify debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, payments for contingent consideration made after a business combination and distributions received from equity method investments. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In February 2015, the FASB amended the accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities. The amendments modify the evaluation of whether certain legal entities are variable interest entities ("VIE") or voting interest entities, eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs (particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships). The revised guidance is effective for the Company's fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The Company has evaluated the impact of the adoption of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and has determined the OP is considered to be a VIE and continues to consolidate the OP as required under previous GAAP. However, the Company meets the disclosure exemption criteria as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE and the Company s partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest in a business and the assets of the OP can be used for purposes other than settling its obligations, such as paying distributions. As such, the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB amended the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet. The amendment requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability and that the entity apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis. In August 2015, the FASB added that, for line of credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line, regardless of whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings. The revised guidance is effective for the Company's fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. As a result of adoption of the new guidance, the Company has reclassified deferred financing costs, net related to mortgage notes payable of   $4.3 million   and   $2.8 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   as a reduction of the carrying amount of its mortgage note payable. See   Note 5   Mortgage Note Payable  . 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an update that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based compensation. Among other things, the revised guidance allows companies to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted the provisions of this guidance beginning January 1, 2016 and determined that there is no impact to the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company's policy is to account for forfeitures as they occur.

Note 3   Real Estate Investments 
  On June 15, 2016, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary of the OP, completed its acquisition of the leasehold interest in an institutional-quality office building located at 1140 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, New York ("1140 Avenue of the Americas"). 1140 Avenue of the Americas comprises   249,703   square feet and is subject to a remaining   50.3   year ground lease that expires on December 31, 2066, held by 1140 Sixth Avenue LLC. The ground lease has a fixed annual rent of   $0.3 million   until January 1, 2017, at which time the fixed annual rent increases to   $4.7 million   through December 2041 and   $5.1 million   through the remainder of the term. The seller of 1140 Avenue of the Americas was BPGL Holdings LLC. The contract purchase price for 1140 Avenue of the Americas was   $180.0 million  , exclusive of closing costs. The Company funded the purchase price with proceeds from the Company's IPO and a mortgage loan from Ladder Capital Finance I LLC (see   Note 5   Mortgage Note Payable  ). The Company accounted for the purchase of 1140 Avenue of the Americas as a business combination and incurred acquisition related costs of   $4.3 million  , which are reflected in the acquisition and transaction related line item of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  
  The following table presents the allocation of the real estate assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   as well as the weighted-average remaining amortization period (in years) as of the acquisition date for intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

The following table presents unaudited pro forma information as if the acquisition during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   had been consummated on January 1, 2015 and the acquisition during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   had been consummated on January 1, 2014. Accordingly, the pro forma net loss was adjusted to reclassify acquisition and transaction related expense of   $4.3 million   from the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Additionally, pro forma net loss was adjusted to reclassify acquisition and transaction related expense of   $6.0 million   from the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to January 1, 2014. 

_______________ 
  (1)    For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , aggregate revenues and net income (adjusted for acquisition and transaction costs) derived from the Company's acquisition for the Company's period of ownership were   $6.0 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively. 
  Future Minimum Cash Rent 
  The following table presents future minimum base cash rental payments due to the Company subsequent to   September 30, 2016  .

Significant Tenant 
  The following table lists the tenants whose annualized rental income on a straight-line basis represented greater than 10% of total annualized rental income for all portfolio properties on a straight-line basis as of   September 30, 2015  .

Note 4   Investment Securities    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had an investment in an equity security with a fair value of   $0.5 million  . The equity security consists of a mutual fund managed by an affiliate of the Sponsor. See   Note 9   Related Party Transactions and Arrangements  . This investment is considered to be an available-for-sale security and therefore increases or decreases in the fair value of this investment are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets unless the security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the losses would be reclassified to expense. 
  The following table details the unrealized gains and losses on the investment security by security type as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Note 6   Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the instrument. This alternative approach also reflects the contractual terms of the instrument, as applicable, including the period to maturity, and may use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities, and unobservable inputs, such as expected volatility. The guidance defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. 
                       
    Level 1 
      
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 
      
    Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability. 

Level 3 
      
    Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity's own assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques. 

The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 
  The Company has an investment in a real estate income fund that is traded in active markets and therefore, due to the availability of quoted market prices in active markets, classifies this investment as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  The following table presents information about the Company's asset measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which that instrument falls. 

There were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
  Financial instruments not carried at fair value 
  The Company is required to disclose at least annually the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value. The fair value of short-term financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and distributions payable approximates their carrying value on the consolidated balance sheets due to their short-term nature. The fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet are reported below:

As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not have any financial instruments not carried at fair value or an amount that approximates fair value. The fair value of the mortgage note payable on 123 William Street is deemed to be equivalent to its carrying value because it bears interest at a variable rate that fluctuates with market rates and there has been no material change in the credit risk or credit markets since origination. 
   
  Note 7   Common Stock 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   30.6 million   shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares and shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, and had received total proceeds from public offerings of   $759.8 million  , inclusive of   $41.0 million   from the DRIP and net of repurchases. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   30.4 million   shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares and shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, and had received total gross proceeds of   $754.6 million  , inclusive of   $24.9 million   from the DRIP. 
  In May 2014, the board of directors of the Company authorized, and the Company declared, a distribution payable to stockholders of record each day during the applicable period equal to   $0.0041438356   per day, which is equivalent to   $1.5125   per annum, per share of common stock. In March 2016, the board of directors of the Company ratified the existing distribution amount equivalent to   $1.5125   per annum, per share of common stock, and, for calendar year 2016, affirmed a change to the daily distribution payable to stockholders of record each day during the applicable period to   $0.004132513665   per day per share of common stock to accurately reflect that 2016 is a leap year. The distributions are payable by the 5th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month. Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds. The board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured. 
  The Company has a Share Repurchase Program ("SRP") that enables stockholders, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to sell their shares to the Company. Under the SRP stockholders may request that the Company repurchase all or any portion of their shares of common stock, if such repurchase does not impair the Company's capital or operations.  
  On January 25, 2016, the Company's board of directors approved an amendment of the SRP to supersede and replace the existing SRP effective beginning on February 28, 2016. Under the SRP, as amended, repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock, when requested, are at the sole discretion of the Company's board of directors and generally will be made semiannually (each six-month period ending June 30 or December 31, a "fiscal semester"). 
  On October 24, 2016, the Company's board of directors approved an Estimated Per-Share NAV as of June 30, 2016.  
  Prior to the establishment of Estimated Per-Share NAV, the purchase price per share for requests other than for death or disability under the SRP depends on the length of time investors have held such shares as follows (in each case, as adjusted for any stock distributions, combinations, splits and recapitalizations): 
             
    after one year from the purchase date - the lower of   $23.13   and   92.5%   of the amount they actually paid for each share; and, 
                
    after two years from the purchase date - the lower of   $23.75   and   95.0%   of the amount they actually paid for each share. 
     Prior to the establishment of Estimated Per-Share NAV, in the case of requests for death or disability, the repurchase price per share is equal to the price paid to acquire the shares from the Company. 
  Following the establishment of Estimated Per-Share NAV, the purchase price per share for requests other than for death or disability under the SRP now depends on the length of time investors have held such shares as follows (in each case, as adjusted for any stock distributions, combinations, splits and recapitalizations): 
             
    after one year from the purchase date -   92.5%   of the Estimated Per-Share NAV; 
                
    after two years from the purchase date -   95.0%   of the Estimated Per-Share NAV; 
                
    after three years from the purchase date -   97.5%   of the Estimated Per-Share NAV; and, 
                
    after four years from the purchase date -   100.0%   of the Estimated Per-Share NAV. 
     Subsequent to the establishment of Estimated Per-Share NAV, in the case of requests for death or disability, the repurchase price per share is equal to the Estimated Per-Share NAV at the time of the repurchase. 
  Repurchases for any fiscal semester will be limited to a maximum of   2.5%   of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the previous fiscal year, with a maximum for any fiscal year of   5.0%   of the weighted average

number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31st of the previous calendar year. In addition, the Company is only authorized to repurchase shares in a given fiscal semester up to the amount of proceeds received from the DRIP in that same fiscal semester, as well as any reservation of funds the Company's board of directors, may, in its sole discretion, make available for this purpose. If the establishment of an Estimated Per-Share NAV occurs during any fiscal semester, any repurchase requests received during such fiscal semester will be paid at the Estimated Per-Share NAV applicable on the last day of the fiscal semester. 
  As permitted under the SRP, the Company s board of directors authorized, with respect to redemption requests received during the first fiscal semester, the repurchase of shares validly submitted for repurchase in an amount equal to the amount of proceeds received from the DRIP in that same fiscal semester, representing less than all the shares validly submitted for repurchase during the first fiscal semester. Pursuant to this authorization   461,555   shares were repurchased for   $10.9 million   at an average repurchase price per share of   $23.62   (including all shares submitted for death or disability) during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The Company will complete a second repurchase in the first quarter of 2017 after completion of the second fiscal semester in accordance with the SRP.  
   
  Note 8   Commitments and Contingencies 
  Litigation and Regulatory Matters 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company may become subject to litigation, claims and regulatory matters. There are no material legal or regulatory proceedings pending or known to be contemplated against the Company. 
  Environmental Matters 
  In connection with the ownership and operation of real estate, the Company may potentially be liable for costs and damages related to environmental matters. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not been notified by any governmental authority of any non-compliance, liability or other claim, and is not aware of any other environmental condition that it believes will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. 
   
  Note 9   Related Party Transactions and Arrangements    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , an entity wholly owned by the Sponsor owned   8,888   shares of the Company s outstanding common stock. 
  Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the "Former Dealer Manager") served as the dealer manager of the IPO, which was ongoing from September 2010 to December 2013, and, together with its affiliates, continued to provide the Company with various services through December 31, 2015. RCS Capital Corporation ("RCAP"), the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager and certain of its affiliates that provided services to the Company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2016, prior to which it was also under common control with AR Global, the parent of the Sponsor. In May 2016, RCAP and its affiliated debtors emerged from bankruptcy under the new name, Aretec Group, Inc. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company had   $0.5 million   invested in a mutual fund managed by an affiliate of the Sponsor. See   Note 4   Investment Securities  . There is no obligation to purchase any additional shares and the shares can be sold at any time. The Company recognized income from investment securities of approximately   $3,000   and approximately    $6,000  , respectively, during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The Company recognized income from investment securities of approximately   $8,000   and approximately   $15,000  , respectively, during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Fees Paid in Connection with the IPO 
  The Former Dealer Manager was paid fees and compensation in connection with the sale of the Company's common stock in the IPO. The Former Dealer Manager was paid a selling commission of up to   7.0%   of the per share purchase price of offering proceeds before reallowance of commissions earned by participating broker-dealers. In addition, the Former Dealer Manager was paid up to   3.0%   of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares as a dealer manager fee. The Former Dealer Manager was able to reallow its dealer manager fee to participating broker-dealers. A participating broker-dealer had the option to elect to receive a fee equal to   7.5%   of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares (not including selling commissions and dealer manager fees) by such participating broker-dealer, with   2.5%   thereof paid at the time of such sale and   1.0%   thereof paid on each anniversary of the closing of such sale up to and including the fifth anniversary of the closing of such sale. If this option was elected, the dealer manager fee would have been reduced to   2.5%   of gross proceeds (not including selling commissions and dealer manager fees).

The Advisor and its affiliates were paid compensation and reimbursement for services relating to the IPO, including transfer agent services and other professional services provided by an affiliate of the Former Dealer Manager. All offering costs incurred by the Company, the Advisor and affiliated entities of the Advisor on behalf of the Company were charged to additional paid-in capital on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets through the end of the IPO. Subsequent to the closing of the IPO, transfer agent and other professional fees are recognized as a component of general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The following table details offering costs and reimbursements incurred from and due to the Advisor and affiliated parties of the Former Dealer Manager as of and for the periods presented: 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , cumulative offering costs, including selling commissions and dealer manager fees, were   $84.0 million  . The Company was responsible for paying offering and related costs from the IPO, excluding commissions and dealer manager fees, up to a maximum of   2.0%   of gross proceeds received from the IPO, measured at the end of the IPO. Offering costs, excluding commissions and dealer manager fees, in excess of the   2.0%   cap as of the end of the IPO are the Advisor s responsibility. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had a receivable from the Advisor totaling   $0.8 million   related to excess offering and related costs. This amount was paid in full during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and therefore   no   receivable remains as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Fees and Participations Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company 
  The Advisor is paid an acquisition fee of   1.5%   of (A) the contract purchase price of each acquired property and (B) the amount advanced for a loan or other investment. The Advisor is also reimbursed for expenses actually incurred related to selecting, evaluating and acquiring assets on the Company's behalf, regardless of whether the Company actually acquires the related assets. Specifically, the Company pays the Advisor or its affiliates for any services provided for which they incur investment-related expenses, or insourced expenses. Such insourced expenses are fixed initially at and may not exceed   0.50%   of the contract purchase price of each property and   0.50%   of the amount advanced for each loan or other investment, which is paid at the closing of each such investment. The Advisor is also reimbursed for legal expenses incurred in the process of acquiring properties, in an amount not to exceed   0.10%   of the contract purchase price. In addition, the Company also pays third parties, or reimburses the Advisor for any investment-related expenses due to third parties. In no event will the total of all acquisition fees, acquisition expenses and any financing coordination fees (as described below) payable with respect to the Company's portfolio of investments exceed   4.5%   of (A) the contract purchase price or (B) the amount advanced for all loans or other investments. Once the proceeds from the primary offering have been fully invested, the aggregate amount of acquisition fees and any financing coordination fees may not exceed   1.5%   of (A) the contract purchase price and (B) the amount advanced for a loan or other investment, as applicable, for all the assets acquired. 
  If the Advisor provides services in connection with the origination or refinancing of any debt that the Company obtains and uses to acquire properties or to make other permitted investments, or that is assumed, directly or indirectly, in connection with the acquisition of properties, the Company pays the Advisor a financing coordination fee equal to   0.75%   of the amount made available or outstanding under such financing, subject to certain limitations.

Until September 30, 2015, for its asset management services, the Company issued to the Advisor an asset management subordinated participation by causing the OP to issue (subject to periodic approval by the board of directors) to the Advisor performance-based, restricted, forfeitable partnership units in the OP designated as  Class B Units  on a quarterly basis in an amount equal to: (i) the product of (y)   0.1875%   multiplied by (z) the cost of the Company's assets divided by (ii) the value of one share of common stock as of the last day of such calendar quarter, which is equal initially to   $22.50   (the primary offering price minus selling commissions and dealer manager fees). The Class B Units are intended to be profits interests and will vest, and no longer be subject to forfeiture, at such time as: (a) the value of the OP's assets plus all distributions made by the Company to its stockholders equals or exceeds the total amount of capital contributed by investors plus a   6.0%   cumulative, pretax, non-compounded annual return thereon, or the "economic hurdle;" (b) any one of the following events occurs concurrently with or subsequently to the achievement of the economic hurdle described above: (i) a listing of the Company's common stock on a national securities exchange; (ii) a transaction to which the Company or the OP is a party, as a result of which OP Units or the Company's common stock are or will be exchanged for or converted into the right, or the holders of such securities will otherwise be entitled, to receive cash, securities or other property or any combination thereof; or (iii) the termination of the advisory agreement without cause by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Company's independent directors after the economic hurdle has been met; and (c) the Advisor pursuant to the advisory agreement is providing services to the Company immediately prior to the occurrence of an event of the type described in clause (b) above, unless the failure to provide such services is attributable to the termination without cause of the advisory agreement by an affirmative vote of the majority of the Company's independent directors after the economic hurdle has been met (the "performance condition"). The value of issued Class B Units will be determined and expensed when the Company deems the achievement of the performance condition to be probable. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company cannot determine the probability of achieving the performance condition. The Advisor receives distributions on its vested and unvested Class B Units at the same rate as distributions received on the Company's common stock. Such distributions on issued Class B Units are expensed in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss until the performance condition is considered probable to occur. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's board of directors has approved the issuance of   159,159   Class B Units in connection with the arrangement. Beginning on October 1, 2015, and in lieu of the asset management subordinated participation, the Company pays an asset management fee to the Advisor or its assignees as compensation for services rendered in connection with the management of the Company s assets. The asset management fee is payable on the first business day of each month in the amount of   0.0625%   multiplied by (i) the cost of the Company's assets for the preceding monthly period or (ii) during the period of time after the Company publishes Estimated Per-Share NAV, the lower of the cost of assets and the estimated fair market value of the Company s assets as reported in the applicable periodic or current report filed with the SEC disclosing the fair market value. The Company paid   $1.3 million   and   $3.3 million   in cash asset management fees during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Company did not pay any cash asset management fees during the   three or nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Unless the Company contracts with a third party, the Company pays the Property Manager a property management fee equal to: (i) for non-hotel properties,   4.0%   of gross revenues from the properties managed, plus market-based leasing commissions; and (ii) for hotel properties, a market-based fee based on a percentage of gross revenues. The Company also reimburses the Property Manager for property-level expenses. The Property Manager may subcontract the performance of its property management and leasing services duties to third parties and pay all or a portion of its property management fee to the third parties with whom it contracts for these services. The Company paid   $0.2 million   and   $0.3 million   in property management fees during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Company paid   $0.1 million   in property management fees during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

The Company reimburses the Advisor s costs of providing administrative services, subject to the limitation that the Company will not reimburse the Advisor for any amount by which the Company s operating expenses at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceeds the greater of (a)   2.0%   of average invested assets and (b)   25.0%   of net income other than any additions to reserves for depreciation, bad debt, impairments or other similar non-cash expenses and excluding any gain from the sale of assets for that period, unless the Company's independent directors determine that such excess was justified based on unusual and nonrecurring factors which they deem sufficient, in which case the excess amount may be reimbursed to the Advisor in subsequent periods. Additionally, the Company reimburses the Advisor for personnel costs in connection with other services; however, the Company may not reimburse the Advisor for personnel costs in connection with services for which the Advisor receives acquisition fees or real estate commissions. The Company s executive officers, who are employees of affiliates of the Advisor and Property Manager, do not receive any compensation directly from the Company for serving as executive officers. The Company does not reimburse the Advisor and its affiliates that are involved in managing the Company s operations, including the Property Manager, for salaries, bonuses or benefits incurred by these entities and paid to the Company s executive officers. Total reimbursement of costs and expenses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $0.5 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively. Total reimbursement of costs and expenses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was   $0.2 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively. 
  The predecessor to the parent of the Sponsor was party to a services agreement with RCS Advisory Services, LLC, a subsidiary of the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager ("RCS Advisory"), pursuant to which RCS Advisory and its affiliates provided the Company and certain other companies sponsored by the Sponsor with services (including, without limitation, transaction management, compliance, due diligence, event coordination and marketing services, among others) on a time and expenses incurred basis or at a flat rate based on services performed. The predecessor to the parent of the Sponsor instructed RCS Advisory to stop providing such services in November 2015 and no services have since been provided by RCS Advisory. 
  The Company was also party to a transfer agency agreement with American National Stock Transfer, LLC, ("ANST") a subsidiary of the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager, pursuant to which ANST provided the Company with transfer agency services (including broker and stockholder servicing, transaction processing, year-end Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") reporting and other services), and supervisory services overseeing the transfer agency services performed by DST Systems, Inc. ("DST"), a third-party transfer agent. The Sponsor received written notice from ANST on February 10, 2016 that it would wind down operations by the end of the month and would withdraw as the transfer agent effective February 29, 2016. DST continued to provide the Company with transfer agency services and, on March 10, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with DST to provide the Company directly with transfer agency services (including broker and stockholder servicing, transaction processing, year-end IRS reporting and other services). For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the fees for services from DST are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the period in which the service was provided.

    Beginning in the third quarter 2015, fees related to property management and leasing were charged to the Company.  
     Fees and Participations Paid in Connection with Liquidation or Listing 
  The Company will pay to the Advisor an annual subordinated performance fee calculated on the basis of the Company s return to stockholders, payable annually in arrears, such that for any year in which investors receive payment of   6.0%   per annum, the Advisor will be entitled to   15.0%   of the excess return, provided that the amount paid to the Advisor does not exceed   10.0%   of the aggregate return for such year, and that the amount paid to the Advisor will not be paid unless investors receive a return of capital contributions. This fee will be paid only upon the sale of assets, distributions or other event which results in the return on stockholders  capital exceeding   6.0%   per annum.   No   subordinated performance fees were incurred during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The Company will pay a brokerage commission to the Advisor or its affiliates on the sale of properties, not to exceed the lesser of   2.0%   of the contract sale price of the property and   50.0%   of the total brokerage commission paid if a third party broker is also involved; provided, however, that in no event may the real estate commissions paid to the Advisor, its affiliates and unaffiliated third parties exceed the lesser of   6.0%   of the contract sales price and a reasonable, customary and competitive real estate commission, in each case, payable to the Advisor if the Advisor or its affiliates, as determined by a majority of the independent directors, provided a substantial amount of services in connection with the sale.   No   such fees were incurred during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Upon a sale of all or substantially all assets, the Special Limited Partner will receive a subordinated distribution from the OP equal to   15.0%   of remaining net sale proceeds after return of capital contributions to investors plus payment to investors of an annual   6.0%   cumulative, pre-tax non-compounded return on the capital contributed by investors. The Special Limited Partner will not be entitled to the subordinated participation in net sale proceeds unless the Company s investors have received a return of their capital plus a   6.0%   cumulative non-compounded annual return on their capital contributions.   No   such participation in net sales proceeds became due and payable during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

The Special Limited Partner will not be entitled to the subordinated incentive listing distribution unless investors have received a   6.0%   cumulative, pre-tax non-compounded annual return on their capital contributions.   No   such distributions were incurred during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Neither the Special Limited Partner nor any of its affiliates can earn both the subordinated participation in net sales proceeds and the subordinated incentive listing distribution. 
  Upon termination or non-renewal of the advisory agreement with or without cause, the Special Limited Partner will be entitled to receive distributions from the OP equal to   15.0%   of the amount by which the sum of the Company s market value plus distributions exceeds the sum of the aggregate capital contributed by investors plus an amount equal to an annual   6.0%   cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded annual return to investors. The Special Limited Partner may elect to defer its right to receive a subordinated distribution upon termination until either a listing on a national securities exchange or other liquidity event occurs.

  Under various agreements, the Company has engaged or will engage the Advisor, its affiliates and entities under common control with the Advisor to provide certain services that are essential to the Company, including asset management services, supervision of the management and leasing of properties owned by the Company, asset acquisition and disposition decisions, as well as other administrative responsibilities for the Company including accounting services, transaction management and investor relations.  
  As a result of these relationships, the Company is dependent upon the Advisor and its affiliates. In the event that the Advisor and its affiliates are unable to provide the Company with the respective services, the Company will be required to find alternative providers of these services. 
   
  Note 11   Share-Based Compensation 
  Restricted Share Plan 
  The Company has an employee and director incentive restricted share plan (the  RSP ), which provides for the automatic grant of   1,333   restricted shares of common stock to each of the independent directors, without any further approval by the Company s board of directors or the stockholders, after initial election to the board of directors and after each annual stockholder meeting, with such shares vesting annually beginning with the one year anniversary of initial election to the board of directors and the date of the next annual meeting, respectively. Restricted stock issued to independent directors will vest over a   five  -year period in increments of   20.0%   per annum. The RSP provides the Company with the ability to grant awards of restricted shares to the Company's directors, officers and employees (if the Company ever has employees), employees of the Advisor and its affiliates, employees of entities that provide services to the Company, directors of the Advisor or of entities that provide services to the Company, certain consultants to the Company and the Advisor and its affiliates or to entities that provide services to the Company. The total number of common shares granted under the RSP shall not exceed   5.0%   of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis at any time and in any event will not exceed   1.5 million   shares (as such number may be adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations and similar events). 
  Restricted share awards entitle the recipient to receive shares of common stock from the Company under terms that provide for vesting over a specified period of time. For restricted share awards granted prior to July 1, 2015, such awards would typically be forfeited with respect to the unvested shares upon the termination of the recipient's employment or other relationship with the Company. For restricted share awards granted on or after July 1, 2015, such awards provide for accelerated vesting of the portion of the unvested shares scheduled to vest in the year of the recipient's voluntary termination or the failure to be re-elected to the board. Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed and the shares have vested. Holders of restricted shares may receive cash distributions prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have lapsed. Any distributions payable in shares of common stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying restricted shares.

  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of American Realty Capital New York City REIT, Inc. (including, as required by context, New York City Operating Partnership, L.P. and its subsidiaries, the "Company," "we," "our" or "us") and members of our management team, as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based, and generally are identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "seeks," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "plans," "intends," "should" or similar expressions. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law. 
  The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements: 
             
    We have a limited operating history which makes our future performance difficult to predict; 
                
    All of our executive officers are also officers, managers or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor, New York City Advisors, LLC (our "Advisor") and other entities affiliated with AR Global Investments, LLC (the successor business to AR Capital, LLC, "AR Global"); as a result, our executive officers, our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our Advisor's compensation arrangements with us and other investor entities advised by AR Global affiliates and conflicts in allocating time among these entities and us, which could negatively impact our operating results; 
                
    We depend on tenants for our revenue and, accordingly, our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants; 
                
    We may not be able to achieve our rental rate objectives on new and renewal leases and our expenses could be greater, which may impact operations; 
                
    Our properties may be adversely affected by economic cycles and risks inherent to the New York metropolitan statistical area, especially New York City; 
                
    We are obligated to pay fees, which may be substantial, to our Advisor and its affiliates; 
                
    We may fail to continue to qualify to be treated as a real estate investment trust for United States federal income tax purposes ("REIT"); 
                
    Because investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for other AR Global-advised programs or investors, our Advisor and its affiliates may face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase of properties and other investments and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, meaning that we could invest in less attractive assets, which could reduce the investment return to our stockholders; 
                
    We are party to an investment opportunity allocation agreement with another program that is sponsored by American Realty Capital III, LLC (our "Sponsor"), pursuant to which we may not have the first opportunity to acquire all properties identified by our Advisor and its affiliates; 
                
    No public market currently exists, or may ever exist, for shares of our common stock and our shares are, and may continue to be, illiquid; 
                
    Our stockholders are limited in their ability to sell their shares pursuant to our share repurchase program (the  SRP ) and may have to hold their shares for an indefinite period of time; 
                
    If we and our Advisor are unable to find suitable investments, then we may not be able to achieve our investment objectives, or pay distributions with cash flows from operations; 
                
    Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions; 
                
    We do not expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in 2016 to fund distributions at our current level, and there can be no assurance we will be able to continue paying cash distributions at our current level or at all; 
                
    We cannot assure our stockholders that we will be able to continue to pay distributions or that distributions will increase over time;

  Overview 
  We were incorporated on December 19, 2013 as a Maryland corporation and elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. On April 24, 2014, we commenced our initial public offering ("IPO") on a "reasonable best efforts" basis of up to   30.0 million   shares of common stock,   $0.01   par value per share, at a price of   $25.00   per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, for total gross proceeds of up to   $750.0 million  , pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-11, as amended (File No.   333-194135  ) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Registration Statement also covered up to   10.5 million   shares available pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the "DRIP") under which our common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock at a price of   $23.75   per share, which is equal to   95%   of the offering price in the IPO. 
  On May 29, 2014, we received and accepted subscriptions in excess of the minimum offering amount for the IPO of   $2.0 million   in shares, broke general escrow and issued shares of common stock to initial investors who were admitted as stockholders. In February 2015, as permitted, we reallocated the remaining   10.0 million   DRIP shares available under the Registration Statement to the primary offering. On May 22, 2015, we registered an additional   25.0 million   shares to be issued pursuant to the DRIP pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-204433). We closed our IPO on May 31, 2015, and continued to accept subscriptions in process as of that date. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   30.6 million   shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares and shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, and had received total gross proceeds from the IPO and the DRIP of   $759.8 million  , inclusive of   $41.0 million   from the DRIP. The per share purchase price in the IPO was up to   $25.00   per share (including the maximum allowed to be charged for commissions and fees) and shares issued under the DRIP is equal to   $23.75   per share, which is equal to   95%   of the offering price in the primary offering.  
  On October 24, 2016, our board of directors approved an estimated net asset value per share of the Company's common stock ("Estimated Per-Share NAV) as of June 30, 2016, which was published on October 26, 2016 ("NAV Pricing Date"). We intend to publish subsequent valuations of Estimated Per-Share NAV periodically at the discretion of our board of directors, provided that such valuations will be made at least once annually. Until the NAV Pricing Date, we offered shares pursuant to the DRIP at   $23.75   per share and have repurchased shares pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program ("SRP"). Beginning with the NAV Pricing Date, we began to offer shares pursuant to the DRIP and repurchase shares pursuant to our SRP at a price based on Estimated Per-Share NAV. 
  We were formed to invest our assets in properties in the five boroughs of New York City, with a focus on Manhattan. We may also purchase certain real estate assets that accompany office properties, including retail spaces and amenities, as well as hospitality assets, residential assets and other property types exclusively in New York City. All such properties may be acquired and owned by us alone or jointly with another party. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   six   properties consisting of   1,091,571   rentable square feet, which were   89.8%   leased, with a weighted average remaining lease term of   6.6   years. Our   six   properties include one commercial property, one property consisting of three condominium units (one retail unit, a parking garage and one office unit), one parking garage and three institutional-quality office buildings. 
  Substantially all of our business is conducted through New York City Operating Partnership, L.P. a Delaware limited partnership (the  OP ). We are the sole general partner and hold substantially all of the units of limited partner interests in the OP, entitled "OP Units" ( OP Units ). The Advisor contributed   $2,020   to the OP in exchange for   90   OP Units, which represents a nominal percentage of the aggregate OP ownership. A holder of OP Units has the right to convert OP Units for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock or, at the option of the OP, a corresponding number of shares of our common stock, in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of the OP, provided, however, that such OP Units must have been outstanding for at least one year. The remaining rights of the limited partners in the OP are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP's assets. 
  We have no employees. Our Advisor manages our affairs on a day-to-day basis. New York City Properties, LLC (our "Property Manager") manages our properties, unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties. The Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global, the parent of our Sponsor, as a result of which they are related parties and have received or will continue to receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to the investment and management of our assets.

Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies 
  Set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. These significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies include: 
  Offering and Related Costs 
  All offering costs incurred by us, our Advisor and its affiliates on our behalf are charged to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. Offering and related costs include all expenses incurred in connection with our IPO. Offering costs (other than selling commissions and the dealer manager fees) include costs that may be paid by the Advisor, the Former Dealer Manager or their affiliates on our behalf. These costs include but are not limited to (i) legal, accounting, printing, mailing, and filing fees; (ii) escrow service related fees; (iii) reimbursement of the Former Dealer Manager for amounts it may pay to reimburse itemized and detailed due diligence expenses of broker-dealers; and (iv) reimbursement to the Advisor for a portion of the costs of its employees and other costs in connection with preparing supplemental sales materials and related offering activities. We are obligated to reimburse the Advisor or its affiliates, as applicable, for organization and offering costs paid by them on our behalf, provided that the Advisor is obligated to reimburse us to the extent organization and offering costs (excluding selling commissions and the dealer manager fee) incurred by us in our IPO exceed   2.0%   of gross offering proceeds in the IPO. As a result, these costs are our liability to the extent aggregate selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and other organization and offering costs are less than   12.0%   of the gross proceeds determined at the end of the IPO. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Our revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. Because many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") require us to record a receivable, and include in revenues on a straight-line basis, unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. We defer the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates.  When we acquire a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for the purposes of this calculation. 
  Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased space. For the tenant to take possession, the leased space must be substantially ready for its intended use. To determine whether the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use, we evaluate whether we own or if the tenant owns the tenant improvements. When we are the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of the finished space, which is when such improvements are substantially complete. When we conclude that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the space. 
  When we conclude that we are the owner of tenant improvements, we capitalize the cost to construct the tenant improvements, including costs paid for or reimbursed by the tenants. When we conclude that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes, we record our contribution towards those improvements as a lease incentive, which is included in deferred leasing costs, net on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized as a reduction to rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
  We continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, we will record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in our consolidated statements of operations. 
  We may own certain properties with leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant's sales upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds or other targets which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets. As the lessor to the aforementioned leases, we defer the recognition of contingent rental income until the specified target that triggered the contingent rental income is achieved, or until such sales upon which percentage rent is based are known. If we own certain properties with leases that include these provisions, contingent rental income will be included in rental income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
  Cost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.

Investments in Real Estate 
  We evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations. If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets. 
  In business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities and non-controlling interests based on their respective estimated fair values. Tangible assets may include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible assets or liabilities may include the value of in-place leases, above- and below-market leases and other identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics. 
  The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property with an in-place operating lease is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the  as-if-vacant  value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on the fair value of the tangible assets. The fair value of in-place leases is determined by considering estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases. The fair value of above- or below-market leases is recorded based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and our estimate of  the comparable fair market lease rate, measured over the remaining term of the lease. The fair value of other intangible assets, such as real estate tax abatements and signage rights, are recorded based on the present value of the expected benefit and amortized over the expected useful life including any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. 
  Fair values of assumed mortgages, if applicable, are recorded as debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which is calculated to account for either above- or below-market interest rates. 
  Non-controlling interests in property owning entities are recorded based on the fair value of units issued at the date of acquisition, as determined by the terms of the applicable agreement. 
  We utilize a number of sources in making our estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, including real estate valuations prepared by independent valuation firms. We also consider information and other factors including: market conditions, the industry in which the tenant operates, characteristics of the real estate such as location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates, tenant credit profile and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant s business. 
  Disposals of real estate investments that represent a strategic shift in operations that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all periods presented; otherwise, we continue to report these properties' operations within continuing operations. Properties that are intended to be sold will be designated as "held for sale" on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs for all periods presented when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale. Properties are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale. 
  Restricted Cash 
  Restricted cash consists of mortgage lender required reserves for maintenance, real estate tax, structural, and debt service reserves. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to   40   years for buildings,   15   years for land improvements,   five   to   seven   years for fixtures and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests. 
  Acquired above-market leases are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Acquired below-market leases are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods. 
  The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases. 
  Assumed mortgage premiums or discounts, if applicable, are amortized as a reduction or increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective mortgages.

Impairment of Long Lived Assets  
  When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition. These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If such estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is based on the adjustment to estimated fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. Generally, we determine estimated fair value for properties held for sale based on the agreed-upon selling price of an asset. These assessments may result in the immediate recognition of an impairment loss resulting in a reduction to net income (loss). 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncement 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued revised guidance relating to revenue recognition. Under the revised guidance, an entity is required to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The revised guidance was to become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption was not permitted under GAAP. The revised guidance allows entities to apply the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method upon adoption. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the revised guidance by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although entities will be allowed to early adopt the guidance as of the original effective date. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an update which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. The new guidance requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The revised guidance supersedes previous leasing standards and is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise to provide goods or services to a customer is performed in a principal or agent capacity and to recognize revenue in a gross or net manner based on its principal/agent designation. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes how entities measure credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost. The update eliminates the requirement that a credit loss must be probable before it can be recognized and instead requires an entity to recognize the current estimate of all expected credit losses. Additionally, the update requires credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be carried as an allowance rather than as a direct write-down of the asset. The amendments become effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments may be adopted early for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance on how certain transactions should be classified and presented in the statement of cash flows as either operating, investing or financing activities. Among other things, the update provides specific guidance on where to classify debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, payments for contingent consideration made after a business combination and distributions received from equity method investments. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In February 2015, the FASB amended the accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities. The amendments modify the evaluation of whether certain legal entities are variable interest entities ("VIE") or voting interest entities, eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs (particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships). The revised guidance is effective for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.  In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a joint venture and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as ownership interest, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the other partners or members as well as whether the entity is a VIE for which we are the primary beneficiary. We have evaluated the impact of the adoption of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and determined that the OP, which holds substantially all of our assets and liabilities, is considered to be a VIE. We meet the disclosure exemption criteria of the new guidance as we are the primary beneficiary of the OP and our partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest in a business, and the OP's assets can be used for purposes other than settling its obligations, such as paying distributions. Further, we have consolidated the OP even prior to the adoption of the new guidance. As such, the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB amended the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet. The amendment requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability and that the entity apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis. In August 2015, the FASB added that, for line of credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line, regardless of whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings. The revised guidance is effective for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. As a result of adoption of the new guidance, we reclassified deferred financing costs, net related to mortgage notes payable as a reduction of the carrying amount of mortgage notes payable. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an update that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based compensation. Among other things, the revised guidance allows companies to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We have adopted the provisions of this guidance beginning January 1, 2016 and determined that there is no impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our policy is to account for forfeitures as they occur.

Results of Operations 
  Comparison of   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   to   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  As of July 1, 2015, we owned five properties (our "Three-Month Same Store"). From July 1, 2015 through   September 30, 2016  , we acquired one property located at 1140 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, New York (our "Three-Month Acquisition"), and therefore as of   September 30, 2016   we owned   six   properties. Due to our Three-Month Acquisition our results of operations for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , reflect significant increases in most categories. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , 9 Times Square was   56.0%   occupied, which increased from 49.7% occupied as of   September 30, 2015  . Subsequent to the acquisition of 9 Times Square in November 2014, we allowed leases to expire and terminate as part of the implementation of our repositioning, redeveloping and remarketing plan with respect to the property. Leasing activity for the remodeled retail space at the building has been slower than expected, however, largely due to construction timing delays and excess retail space capacity in the Times Square sub-market. Continued delays or market weakness could suppress our financial results at this property; however, we have seen positive leasing with respect to the vacant office space in the current quarter and expect this trend to continue. 
  Rental Income 
  Rental income increased   $6.1 million   to   $13.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $7.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to our Three-Month Acquisition which contributed $4.9 million to the increase. Our Three-Month Same Store provided $1.2 million of the increase primarily due to lease commencements at 123 William Street and an acquisition that closed in March 2015. Additionally, 9 Times Square contributed $0.1 million to the increase in Three-Month Same Store, primarily due to lease commencements. 
  Operating Expense Reimbursements 
  Operating expense reimbursements increased   $0.4 million   to   $1.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , due to our Three-Month Acquisition and Three-Month Same Store which each contributed $0.2 million to the increase.  
  Pursuant to many of our lease agreements, tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of certain property operating expenses, in addition to base rent, whereas under certain other lease agreements, the tenants are directly responsible for most operating costs of the respective properties. Therefore, operating expense reimbursements are directly affected by changes in property operating expenses, although not all increases in property operating expenses may be reimbursed by our tenants. 
  Property Operating Expenses 
  Property operating expenses increased   $2.8 million   to   $6.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $3.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   primarily due to our Three-Month Acquisition, which contributed $2.5 million to the increase. Our Three-Month Same Store provided $0.3 million of the increase mainly due to increases at 9 Times Square due to higher occupancy. The increase in property operating expenses primarily related to lease commencements and the increased costs of maintaining our   six   properties including real estate taxes, condominium fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance and property insurance. 
  Operating Fees incurred from Related Parties 
  We incurred   $1.5 million   in fees for asset and property management services from our Advisor and Property Manager for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  . Until September 30, 2015, for its asset management services, we issued to the Advisor performance-based, restricted, forfeitable partnership units in the OP designated as "Class B Units." Beginning on October 1, 2015, we began paying monthly asset management fees in cash, in shares of common stock, or a combination of both, the form of payment to be determined at the sole discretion of the Advisor. We paid   $1.3 million   in cash for asset management fees for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Property management fees increase in direct correlation with gross revenue and amounted to   $0.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Acquisition and Transaction Related Expenses 
  We incurred approximately   $24,000   of acquisition and transaction related expenses for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  . For the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , we incurred   no   acquisition and transaction related expenses.

General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses increased   $0.6 million   to   $1.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $0.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to general and administrative expense reimbursements incurred from our Advisor of   $0.5 million  . During the year ended December 31, 2015, our Advisor began requesting reimbursement of general and administrative expenses, which had not previously been requested, but no such reimbursement requests were made during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . Increased professional fees related to our 2016 annual meeting and to maintaining our larger real estate portfolio also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses.  
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased   $2.5 million   to   $7.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $4.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , due to our Three-Month Acquisition. Our Three-Month Same Store contributed $0.1 million to the increase.  
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense increased   $1.2 million   to   $2.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $1.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   primarily due to the closing of the loan on our Three-Month Acquisition in June 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had two loans outstanding with a combined balance of   $195.0 million   and a weighted average effective interest rate of   3.58%  . 
  Income from Investment Securities and Interest 
  Income from investment securities and interest remained at   $0.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The income related to interest earned on our cash balance for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   and dividends earned on our investment in equity securities purchased in August 2014. 
  Comparison of   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   to   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  As of January 1, 2015, we owned four properties (our "Nine-Month Same Store"). From January 1, 2015 through   September 30, 2016  , we acquired two properties (our "Nine-Month Acquisitions"), and therefore as of   September 30, 2016   we owned   six   properties. Accordingly, due to our Nine-Month Acquisitions, our results of operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   reflect significant increases in most categories. 
  Rental Income 
  Rental income increased   $13.8 million   to   $30.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $16.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to our Nine-Month Acquisitions, which contributed $13.3 million to the increase. Our Nine-Month Same Store contributed $0.5 million to the increase in rental income, driven primarily by lease commencements at 9 Times Square. 
  Operating Expense Reimbursements 
  Operating expense reimbursements increased   $1.0 million   to   $2.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to our Nine-Month Acquisitions. 
  Pursuant to many of our lease agreements, tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of certain property operating expenses, in addition to base rent, whereas under certain other lease agreements, the tenants are directly responsible for most operating costs of the respective properties. Therefore, operating expense reimbursements are directly affected by changes in property operating expenses, although not all increases in property operating expenses may be reimbursed by our tenants. 
  Property Operating Expenses 
  Property operating expenses increased   $6.3 million   to   $13.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $7.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to our Nine-Month Acquisitions. Our Nine-Month Same Store also contributed $0.5 million to the increase. Property operating expenses related to lease commencements and the costs of maintaining our   six   properties including real estate taxes, condominium fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance and property insurance.

Operating Fees incurred from Related Parties 
  We incurred   $3.7 million   in fees for asset and property management services from our Advisor and Property Manager for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Until September 30, 2015, for its asset management services, we issued to the Advisor performance-based, restricted, forfeitable partnership units in the OP designated as "Class B Units." Beginning on October 1, 2015, we began paying monthly asset management fees in cash, in shares of common stock, or a combination of both, the form of payment to be determined at the sole discretion of the Advisor. We paid   $3.3 million   in cash for asset management fees for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Property management fees increase in direct correlation with gross revenue and amounted to   $0.3 million   and   $0.1   million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Property Manager elected to waive a portion of property management fees for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we would have incurred and additional   $0.2   million of property management fees had these fees not been waived.  
  Acquisition and Transaction Related Expenses 
  We incurred   $4.3 million   of acquisition and transaction related expenses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   which related to our purchase of 1140 Avenue of the Americas, which closed in June 2016. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , acquisition and transaction related expenses of   $6.0 million   related to our purchase of 123 William Street, which closed in March 2015. 
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses increased   $1.5 million   to   $3.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $2.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to general and administrative expense reimbursements incurred from our Advisor of   $1.3 million  . During the year ended December 31, 2015, our Advisor began requesting reimbursement of general and administrative expenses, which had not previously been requested, but no such reimbursement requests were made during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased   $5.2 million   to   $16.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $11.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , due to our Nine-Month Acquisitions. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense of   $5.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   related to our two mortgage notes payable, the proceeds of which funded portions of our Nine-Month Acquisitions. As of   September 30, 2016  , the loans had a combined balance of   $195.0 million   and a weighted average effective interest rate of   3.58%  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , interest expense was   $2.4 million  . 
  Income from Investment Securities and Interest 
  Income from investment securities and interest increased to   $0.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from approximately   $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The income related to interest earned on our cash balance for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and dividends earned on our investment in equity securities purchased in August 2014. 
  Cash Flows for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016 
  During   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash used in operating activities was   $0.6 million  , compared to   $8.2 million   of net cash used in operating activities during   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Net cash used in operating activities contained acquisition and transaction related expenses of approximately   $4.3 million   and   $6.0 million  , respectively, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The level of cash flows used in operating activities is affected by the volume of acquisition activity, the timing of interest payments, the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the level of property operating expenses. Notwithstanding a net loss of   $14.2 million  , net cash used in operating activities included adjustments for depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets and other non-cash expenses of   $16.8 million  , which resulted in cash outflows of   $2.6 million  . Net cash used in operating activities also included net cash inflows of   $1.7 million   for an increase in deferred rent related to payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates and other liabilities. As occupancy increases at 9 Times Square, cash flows from operations is expected to increase. 
  Net operating cash outflows primarily related to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of   $6.3 million   primarily related to an increase in unbilled rent receivables recorded in accordance with accounting for rental income on a straight-line basis as well as a   $1.4 million   decrease related to accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with operating activities.

     Table of Contents  

Net cash used in investing activities during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $91.6 million  , primarily related to the acquisition of 1140 Avenue of the Americas for   $79.2 million  , consisting of a purchase price of   $178.5 million  , net of purchase price adjustments, partially funded with a mortgage note payable of   $99.0 million  . Net cash used in investing activities also related to payment of capital expenditures of   $12.4 million   relating to building and tenant improvements at 9 Times Square and 123 William Street. 
  Net cash used in financing activities of   $37.4 million   during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   consisted primarily of distributions to stockholders of   $18.7 million  , payments of   $3.3 million   relating to financing costs, repurchases of common stock of   $12.5 million   and an increase in restricted cash of   $2.9 million  . 
  Cash Flows for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , net cash used in operating activities was   $8.2 million  . The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by recent acquisition activity, the timing of interest payments and the amount of borrowings outstanding during the period, as well as the receipt of scheduled rent payments. Cash flows used in operating activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   included   $6.0 million   of acquisition and transaction costs. Cash flows used in operating activities included a net loss adjusted for non-cash items of   $0.5 million   (net loss of   $11.7 million   adjusted for non-cash items consisting of depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, share based compensation, and deferred financing costs of   $11.3 million  ) and an increase in prepaid expenses, other assets and deferred costs of   $10.3 million   related to tenant and other accounts receivable, unbilled rent receivables recorded in accordance with accounting for rental income on a straight-line basis and leasing costs. These cash outflows were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of   $1.9 million  , primarily related to accrued property operating costs and professional fees and an increase in deferred rent and other liabilities of   $0.6 million  . 
  Net cash used in investing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was   $162.9 million   primarily related to our acquisition of one property for   $157.0 million  , with an aggregate purchase price of   $253.0 million  , partially funded with a mortgage note payable of   $96.0 million  , as well as capital expenditures of   $7.9 million   relating to building and tenant improvements at 9 Times Square and 123 William Street. These cash outflows were partially offset by funds released from escrow of   $2.1 million   related to a prior period acquisition. 
  Net cash provided by financing activities of   $179.7 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock of   $230.6 million  , partially offset by payments of offering costs of   $30.4 million  , distributions to stockholders of   $14.3 million  , payments of financing costs of   $4.6 million   relating to our mortgage note and payments for repurchases of common stock of   $1.6 million  . 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  This section includes non-GAAP financial measures, including funds from operations ("FFO") and modified funds from operations ("MFFO"). A description of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income (loss), is provided below. 
  Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
  The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings, improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including, but not limited to, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using the historical accounting convention for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. 
  Because of these factors, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as FFO, which is used in the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. We believe FFO, which excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization, is an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT s operating performance. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 
  We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards set forth in the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the  White Paper ). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, but excluding gains or losses from sales of property and real estate related impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  
  We believe that the use of FFO provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.

     Table of Contents  

Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP that were put into effect in 2009 subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO, such as the change to expense as incurred rather than capitalize and depreciate acquisition fees and expenses incurred for business combinations, have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses, as items that are expensed under GAAP across all industries. These changes had a particularly significant impact on publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity in the early part of their existence, particularly during the period when they are raising capital through ongoing initial public offerings. 
  Because of these factors, the Investment Program Association (the  IPA ), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs. MFFO is designed to be reflective of the ongoing operating performance of publicly registered, non-listed REITs by adjusting for those costs that are more reflective of acquisitions and investment activity, along with other items the IPA believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT, such as straight-lining of rents as required by GAAP. We believe it is appropriate to use MFFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance because we believe that, when compared year over year, both before and after we have deployed all of our offering proceeds and are no longer incurring a significant amount of acquisitions fees or other related costs, it reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 
  We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the  Practice Guideline ) issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for acquisition and transaction related fees and expenses and other items. In calculating MFFO, we follow the Practice Guideline and exclude acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses, amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income, gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis.  
  We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of acquisition activities and other non-operating items, MFFO can provide, on a going-forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring properties and once our portfolio is stabilized. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry and allows for an evaluation of our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs. 
  Not all REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, calculate FFO and MFFO the same way. Accordingly, comparisons with other REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as determined under GAAP as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations, as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The methods utilized to evaluate the performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT under GAAP should be construed as more relevant measures of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures, FFO and MFFO, and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.  
  Neither the SEC, NAREIT, the IPA nor any other regulatory body or industry trade group has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, NAREIT, the IPA or another industry trade group may publish updates to the White Paper or the Practice Guideline or the SEC or another regulatory body could standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO accordingly.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $53.2 million  . The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from the second quarter 2016 is primarily due to the repurchase of shares which were requested and accrued for repurchase under our SRP as of June 30, 2016. Our principal demands for cash will be for acquisition costs, including the purchase price of any properties, loans and securities we acquire, improvement costs, the payment of our operating and administrative expenses, continuing debt service obligations, distributions to our stockholders and repurchases under our SRP. If we acquire additional assets, we intend to pay for them with cash proceeds from our IPO and mortgage or other debt, but we also may acquire assets free and clear of mortgage or other indebtedness by paying the entire purchase price for the asset in cash or in OP Units.  
  We expect to fund our future short-term operating liquidity requirements, including distributions, through a combination of net cash provided by our current property operations and the operations of properties to be acquired in the future, the remaining proceeds from the sale of common stock and proceeds from secured mortgage financings. Management expects that, as our portfolio of investments stabilizes, specifically 9 Times Square, cash flow from our properties will be sufficient to fund operating expenses and a larger portion of the payment of our monthly distributions. Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured and unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from public and private offerings, proceeds from the sale of properties and undistributed funds from operations. 
  We have used mortgage financing to acquire two of our properties and expect to use debt financing as a source of capital. Under our charter, the maximum amount of our total indebtedness may not exceed 300% of our total "net assets" (as defined in our charter) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally equal to 75% of the cost of our investments. We may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for exceeding such limit. This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments. In addition, it is currently our intention to limit our aggregate borrowings to 40% to 50% of the aggregate fair market value of our assets unless borrowing a greater amount is approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for borrowing such a greater amount. This limitation will be calculated once we have invested substantially all the proceeds of our IPO and will not apply to individual real estate assets or investments. At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that the cost of investment for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value, which will enable us to satisfy our requirements under our charter. However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits. 
  Once the total of our Estimated Per-Share NAV multiplied by the number of shares of common stock outstanding exceeds $1.0 billion, we intend to maintain 5% of the total of our Estimated Per-Share NAV multiplied by the number of shares of common stock outstanding in liquid assets that can be liquidated more readily than properties. However, our stockholders should not expect that we will maintain liquid assets at or above this level. To the extent that we maintain borrowing capacity under a line of credit, such available amount will be included in calculating our liquid assets. Our Advisor will consider various factors in determining the amount of liquid assets we should maintain, including, but not limited to, our receipt of proceeds from sales of additional shares, our cash flow from operations, available borrowing capacity under a line of credit, if any, our receipt of proceeds from any asset sale, and the use of cash to fund repurchases. Our board of directors will review the amount and sources of liquid assets on a quarterly basis.

Share Repurchase Program 
  Our board of directors has adopted the SRP that enables stockholders, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to sell their shares to us. Due to these conditions and limitations, there can be no assurance that all, or any, shares submitted validly for repurchase will be repurchased under the SRP. On January 25, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had unanimously approved an amendment to the SRP. Under the SRP amendment, repurchases of shares of our common stock, when requested, are at the sole discretion of our board of directors and generally will be made semiannually (each six-month period ending June 30 or December 31, a "fiscal semester"). Repurchases for any fiscal semester will be limited to a maximum of 2.5% of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the previous fiscal year, with a maximum for any fiscal year of 5.0% of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31st of the previous calendar year. In addition, we are only authorized to repurchase shares in a given fiscal semester up to the amount of proceeds received from the DRIP in that same fiscal semester, as well as any reservation of funds our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, make available for this purpose. Since we established an Estimated Per-Share NAV during the second fiscal semester of 2016, any repurchase requests received during the second fiscal semester of 2016 will be paid at the Estimated Per-Share NAV applicable on the last day of the fiscal semester. The SRP amendment became effective beginning on February 28, 2016. 
  As permitted under the SRP, the only repurchase requests completed during the three months ended September 30, 2016 were for death or disability. Our second fiscal semester will end on December 31, 2016 at which time we will evaluate repurchase requests. During our first fiscal semester of 2016,   461,555   shares were repurchased for   $10.9 million   at an average repurchase price per share of   $23.62   (including all shares submitted for death or disability), while requests to repurchase   874,782   shares for   $20.3 million   at an average price per share of   $23.21   were not fulfilled.  
  Capital Expenditures 
  We may invest in additional capital expenditures to further enhance the value of our investments. Additionally, many of our lease agreements with tenants include provisions for tenant improvement allowances. 
  As previously noted, subsequent to the acquisition of 9 Times Square in November 2014, we allowed leases to expire and terminate as part of the implementation of our repositioning, redeveloping and remarketing plan with respect to the property. As a result of these initiatives, we expect to incur $2.5 million to $3.0 million of additional capital expenditures during 2016 related to building improvements, tenant improvements and leasing commissions as we continue to execute on our repositioning, redeveloping and remarketing plan. For   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred $4.6 million of capital expenditures related to building improvements, tenant improvements and leasing commissions for 9 Times Square. The remainder of our $8.1 million in capital expenditures for   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   related to building and tenant improvements at 123 William Street and 1140 Avenue of the Americas. 
   
  Acquisitions 
  On June 15, 2016, we, through a wholly-owned subsidiary of the OP, completed our acquisition of the leasehold interest in an institutional-quality office building located at 1140 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, New York ("1140 Avenue of the Americas"). 1140 Avenue of the Americas comprises   249,703   square feet and is subject to a ground lease held by 1140 Sixth Avenue LLC. The seller of 1140 Avenue of the Americas was BPGL Holdings LLC. The purchase price of 1140 Avenue of the Americas was   $178.5 million  , exclusive of closing costs and net of any purchase price adjustments. We funded the purchase price with proceeds from our IPO and a mortgage loan from Ladder Capital Finance I LLC. We accounted for the purchase of 1140 Avenue of the Americas as a business combination and incurred acquisition related costs of   $4.3 million  , which are reflected in the acquisition and transaction related line item of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  
  Our Advisor evaluates potential acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets and engages in negotiations with sellers and borrowers on our behalf. Investors should be aware that after a purchase contract is executed that contains specific terms, the property will not be purchased until the successful completion of due diligence and fully negotiated binding agreements. During this period, we may decide to temporarily invest any unused proceeds from common stock offerings in certain investments that could yield lower returns than the properties. These lower returns may affect our ability to make distributions. 
   
  Distributions 
  We are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, determined without regard for the deduction for distributions paid and excluding net capital gains. On March 9, 2016, our board of directors approved a change to the daily distribution amount to   $0.0041325137   per day per share of common stock to accurately reflect that 2016 is a leap year and maintain equivalence to   $1.5125   per annum, per share of common stock. Distributions to record holders are payable by the 5th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month. 
  
    36 

     Table of Contents  

Future distributions to our stockholders will be determined by our board of directors and are dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for distribution, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, as applicable, requirements of Maryland law and annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds. Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured. 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , distributions paid to common stockholders totaled   $34.8 million  . Of that amount,   $16.1 million   was reinvested in shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , cash used to pay our distributions was generated from proceeds from our IPO and proceeds from the sale of our shares through the DRIP. 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   our cash flows from operations was negative, and we do not expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in 2016 to fund distributions at our current level. We may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund future distributions. The amount of cash available for distributions is affected by many factors, such as rental income from acquired properties and our operating expense levels, as well as many other variables. Actual cash available for distributions may vary substantially from estimates. With limited operating history, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be able to continue to pay distributions or that distributions will increase over time. We cannot give any assurance that rents from the properties we have acquired will increase, or that future acquisitions of real properties will increase our cash available for distributions to stockholders. Our actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions used by our board of directors in establishing a distribution rate to stockholders. 
  We do not expect to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to pay distributions at the current level. In addition to cash flow from operations, we expect to use a portion of our cash on hand, which represents the remaining proceeds we received in our IPO, and the proceeds from our DRIP to pay distributions. A decrease in the level of stockholder participation in our DRIP or any decline in cash flow or need to use cash flow for other purposes could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet these expectations. If these sources are insufficient, we may use other sources, such as from borrowings, the sale of additional securities, advances from our Advisor, and our Advisor's deferral, suspension or waiver of its fees and expense reimbursements, as to which it has no obligation, to fund distributions. There can be no assurance we will be able to continue paying cash distributions at our current level or at all.  
  The following table shows the sources for the payment of distributions to common stockholders for the periods presented:

           (1)

  The following is a summary of our contractual ground lease obligations as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Election as a REIT    
  We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT we must, among other things, distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 
   
  Inflation 
  Many of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures). We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions. In addition, our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance. This may reduce our exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation. 
   
  Related-Party Transactions and Agreements 
  See   Note 9   Related Party Transactions and Arrangements   to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  The market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or interest rates. Our long-term debt, which consists of secured financings, bears interest at fixed and variable-rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. From time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, caps, collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. We do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We do not have any foreign operations and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our debt consisted of both fixed and variable-rate debt. We had a fixed-rate secured mortgage note payable with an aggregate carrying value of   $99.0 million   and a fair value of   $105.1 million  . Changes in market interest rates on our fixed-rate debt impact the fair value of the note, but it has no impact on interest due on the note. For instance, if interest rates rise 100 basis points and our fixed rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our obligation to decrease, the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise. The sensitivity analysis related to our fixed rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their   September 30, 2016   levels, with all other variables held constant. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by   $1.0 million  . A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by   $1.0 million  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our variable-rate secured mortgage note payable had a carrying value and fair value of   $96.0 million  . Interest rate volatility associated with this variable-rate mortgage note payable affects interest expense incurred and cash flow. The sensitivity analysis related to our variable-rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their   September 30, 2016   levels, with all other variables held constant. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates on our variable-rate mortgage note payable would increase or decrease our interest expense by $1.0 million annually. 
  These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rate changes on our borrowing costs, and assuming no other changes in our capital structure. As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of   September 30, 2016   and does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date. The information represented herein has limited predictive value. Future actual realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
  In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded, as of the end of such period, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
  No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds of Registered Securities. 
  Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 
  On July 29, 2016, we granted 3,999 shares of restricted stock that vest over a period of five years to our independent directors, pursuant to our employee and director incentive restricted share plan. No selling commissions or other consideration were paid in connection with such issuance, which was made without registration under the Securities Act in reliance upon exemption from the registration in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as transactions not involving any public offering. 
  Use of Proceeds from Sales of Registered Securities 
  On April 24, 2014, we commenced our IPO on a "reasonable best efforts" basis of up to 30.0 million shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at a price of $25.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to the Registration Statement filed with the SEC under the Securities Act (File No. 333-194135). The Registration Statement also covered 10.5 million shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the DRIP under which common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of common stock. On May 29, 2014, we received and accepted subscriptions in excess of the minimum offering amount for the IPO of $2.0 million in shares, broke general escrow and issued shares of common stock to initial investors who were admitted as stockholders. On May 31, 2015, we closed our IPO after having sold substantially all of the shares registered in our IPO, and continued to accept subscriptions in process as of that date. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   30.6 million   shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares and shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, and had received total gross proceeds from the IPO and DRIP of   $759.8 million  , inclusive of   $41.0 million   from the DRIP. 
  The following table reflects the offering costs associated with the issuance of common stock: 

The Former Dealer Manager was able to reallow the selling commissions and a portion of the dealer manager fees to participating broker-dealers. The following table details the selling commissions incurred and reallowed related to the sale of shares of common stock: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we have incurred   $84.0 million   of cumulative offering costs in connection with the issuance and distribution of our registered securities. Cumulative offering proceeds from the sale of common stock exceeded cumulative offering costs by   $675.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  
    40 

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , cumulative offering costs included   $69.4 million   of selling commissions and dealer manager fees and   $11.9 million   of offering cost reimbursements incurred from the Advisor and Former Dealer Manager. We are obligated to reimburse the Advisor or its affiliates, as applicable, for organization and offering costs paid by them on our behalf, provided that the Advisor is obligated to reimburse us to the extent organization and offering costs (excluding selling commissions and the dealer manager fee) incurred by us in our IPO exceed 2.0% of gross offering proceeds in the IPO. As a result, these costs were only our liability to the extent aggregate selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and other organization and offering costs did not exceed 12.0% of the gross proceeds determined at the end of the IPO. As of the end of the IPO, aggregate selling commissions, dealer manager fees and other offering costs did not exceed 12.0% of the gross proceeds received in the IPO. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have used   $715.4 million   of the   $718.8 million   in aggregate net proceeds from our IPO, excluding the DRIP, as follows: (i)   $492.5 million   to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of six properties; (ii)   $69.4 million   to pay selling commissions and dealer manager fees to our Former Dealer Manager; (iii)   $11.9 million   to reimburse our Advisor for Offering expenses; (iv)   $16.5 million   to pay acquisition fees, acquisition cost reimbursements, financing coordination fees and other fees and reimbursements to our Advisor and its affiliates; (v)   $83.0 million   to pay cash distributions to our stockholders; (vi)   $26.9 million   to fund capital expenditures; and (vii)   $15.2 million   to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the SRP. 
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  As permitted under the SRP, our board of directors authorized, with respect to redemption requests received during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the repurchase of shares validly submitted for repurchase in an amount equal to the amount of proceeds received from the DRIP in that same fiscal semester, representing less than all the shares validly submitted for repurchase during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Accordingly, in July 2016,   457,982   shares were repurchased for   $10.8 million   at an average repurchase price per share of   $23.60   (including all shares submitted for death or disability), while requests to repurchase   874,782   shares for   $20.3 million   at an average price per share of   $23.21   were not fulfilled. Additionally, during April 2016,   3,573   additional shares submitted for death or disability were repurchased for   $0.1 million   at an average repurchase price of   $25.00  .
