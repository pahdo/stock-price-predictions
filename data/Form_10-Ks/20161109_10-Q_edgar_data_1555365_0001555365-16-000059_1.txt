  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  (Unaudited) 
  Unless otherwise indicated, references in these notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements to  we,   us,   our,   WhiteWave,  or the  Company  refer to The WhiteWave Foods Company s operations, taken as a whole. 
   
  1. General 
  Nature of Our Business     We are a leading consumer packaged food and beverage company focused on high-growth product categories that are aligned with emerging consumer trends. We manufacture, market and sell branded plant-based foods and beverages, coffee creamers and beverages, premium dairy products and organic produce. We sell products primarily in North America, Europe and through a joint venture in China. We focus on providing consumers with innovative, great-tasting food and beverage choices that meet their increasing desires for nutritious, flavorful, convenient, and responsibly-produced products. Our widely-recognized, leading brands distributed in North America include   Silk  ,   So Delicious   and   Vega   plant-based foods and beverages,   International Delight   and   LAND O LAKES   coffee creamers and beverages,   Horizon Organic   and   Wallaby Organic   premium dairy products and   Earthbound Farm   organic salads, fruits and vegetables. Our popular plant-based foods and beverages brands in Europe include   Alpro   and   Provamel  .  
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, we report results of operations through   two   reportable segments: Americas Foods   Beverages and Europe Foods   Beverages.  This reporting structure aligns with the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), our CEO, monitors operating performance, allocates resources, and deploys capital.  In 2015, we reported results of operations through   three   reportable segments: Americas Foods   Beverages, Americas Fresh Foods and Europe Foods   Beverages.  In connection with our management restructure in early 2016, we consolidated the historical Americas Foods   Beverages and Americas Fresh Foods segments into a single Americas Foods   Beverages segment.  Accordingly, prior year segment data has been recast to reflect this new segment structure.    
  Basis of Presentation     The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Form 10-Q ) have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 29, 2016. 
  As discussed in Note 16   The Proposed Merger with Danone  , on July 6, 2016 the Company entered into a merger agreement with Danone S.A., a   soci t  anonyme   organized under the laws of France ( Danone ), as a result of which the Company is expected to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Danone. Since the merger has not yet been completed, none of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in this Form 10-Q consider the potential impact of the pending merger.  
       
  In our opinion, we have made all necessary adjustments (which generally include normal recurring adjustments) in order to present fairly, in all material respects, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates and for the periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) have been omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations applicable to quarterly reporting on Form 10-Q. The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes.  Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   may not be indicative of our operating results for the full year. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements     In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606  , to clarify the principles used to recognize revenue for all entities. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09.  In 2016, the FASB has issued the following additional guidance:   i)   ASU No. 2016-08,   Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net),  which provides clarification when assessing whether an entity is a principal or agent in a revenue transaction, and impacts whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis,   ii)   ASU No. 2016-10,   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which amends the guidance in ASU 2014-09 regarding the identification of performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property,   iii)   ASU No. 2016-11,   Rescission of SEC  
  
   7 

Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 Emerging Issues Task Force Meeting,   which rescinds specific SEC guidance related to revenue recognition currently codified in US GAAP as a result of the new revenue standard, and   iv)   ASU No. 2016-12,   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,   which amends the guidance in ASU 2014-09 by providing practical expedients to simplify the transition to the new revenue standard and clarify certain aspects of the standard.  The new guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard includes a five step model to determine when revenue should be recognized, which is when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard allows several methods of adoption including either a full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. Early adoption will be permitted as of the December 31, 2016 original effective date. We are currently evaluating the effects, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and the transition method that we will select to implement the new standard. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern     (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  , to provide guidance on management's responsibility to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosure requirements. This guidance applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. Adoption will require establishing a going concern assessment process to meet the standard. The adoption will not have an impact to the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.   This ASU discusses amendments to existing accounting guidance to modify the subsequent measurement of inventory. Under existing guidance, an entity measures inventory at the lower of cost or market, with market defined as replacement cost, net realizable value ("NRV"), or NRV less a normal profit margin. An entity uses current replacement cost provided that it is not above NRV (ceiling) or below NRV less a normal profit margin (floor). Amendments in the new guidance require an entity to subsequently measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and eliminates the need to determine replacement cost and evaluate whether it is above the ceiling or below the floor. NRV is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for all entities and should be applied prospectively. We expect that the adoption of this guidance will not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.     
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  .  This ASU requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet.  A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are currently evaluating the effects adoption of this guidance will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and financial statement disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance will require companies to include excess tax benefits (deficiencies) as a component of income tax expense rather than additional paid-in capital.  This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The impact ASU No. 2016-09 will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption will mainly depend on unpredictable future events, including the timing and value realized for future share-based transactions upon exercise/vesting versus the fair value at grant date, and will create additional benefit or expense to our consolidated statements of income. 
       
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,   which provides changes on how companies measure and recognize credit losses on financial instruments.  The new guidance will require companies to immediately recognize an estimate of credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of financial assets that are in the scope of the standard.  The new standard is effective for public companies in fiscal years beginning after  
  
   8 

December 31, 2019. We expect that the adoption of this guidance will not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which provides clarification on the treatment of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The pronouncement provides clarification guidance on eight specific cash flow presentation issues that have developed due to diversity in practice. The issues include, but are not limited to, debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and distributions received from equity method investees. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating transition date, but we do not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.     

2. Acquisitions 
  2016 Acquisitions 
  IPP 
  On June 2, 2016, the Company acquired Innovation Packaging and Process, S.A. DE C.V. ("IPP"). Founded in 2007, IPP is an aseptic beverage co-packer based in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The Company purchased IPP for total cash consideration of   $18.1 million  . We funded this acquisition through cash provided from operations. Our preliminary purchase price allocation includes goodwill of   $12.3 million  , property, plant, and equipment of   $9.1 million  , intangible assets subject to amortization of   $0.6 million   related to customer relationships, and liabilities assumed net of working capital items of   $3.9 million  . Customer relationships are being amortized over a   3   year term. 
  The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition have been recorded at their preliminary fair values. Certain estimated values for the acquisition are not yet finalized pending the final purchase price allocations, and as a result, the Company's estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize the allocation of the purchase price within   one year   of the acquisition.  
   IPP produces a wide variety of products for WhiteWave and third parties. The acquisition of IPP provides the ability to grow in Latin American markets by providing in-house manufacturing. We have included IPP's results of operations in our condensed consolidated statements of income in our Americas Foods   Beverages segment from the date of acquisition. 
    
  2015 Acquisitions 
  Wallaby     
  On August 30, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Wallaby Yogurt Company, Inc. ("Wallaby") for approximately   $122.4 million   in cash. We funded this acquisition with borrowings under our credit facility. Founded in 1994 and based in American Canyon, California, Wallaby is a leading manufacturer and distributor of organic dairy yogurt products including Greek and Australian style yogurts and Kefir beverages. The addition of Wallaby strengthened and expanded our growing yogurt portfolio and provided entry into several fast-growing yogurt categories. The acquisition also provided us with additional West Coast manufacturing capabilities and further expansion and growth opportunities. We have included Wallaby's results of operations in our condensed consolidated statements of income in our Americas Foods   Beverages segment from the date of acquisition.  
    
  The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition have been recorded at their fair values. The fair values were determined by management based in part on an independent valuation of assets acquired, which includes intangible assets of approximately   $57.1 million   and relate primarily to tradenames. Intangible assets subject to amortization of approximately   $9.1 million   are being amortized over a   15   year term and relate primarily to customer relationships.  
    
  During the the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $6.3 million   of purchase accounting adjustments to goodwill primarily related to the finalization of the fair value of certain intangible assets. See Note 5 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets." As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has finalized its purchase price allocations related to the acquisition of Wallaby. 
  
   9 

Vega 
    
  On August 1, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Sequel Naturals Ltd, the company that owns the Vega brand ("Vega") and is a pioneer and leader in plant-based nutrition products, for approximately   $553.6 million   in cash funded by borrowings under our credit facility. Vega offers a broad range of plant-based nutrition products - primarily powdered shakes and snack bars. This acquisition extended the Company's Plant-based Foods and Beverages platform into nutritional powders and bars, and provided additional innovation opportunities. We have included Vega's results of operations in our condensed consolidated statements of income in our Americas Foods   Beverages segment from the date of acquisition.  
    
  The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition have been recorded at their fair values. The fair values were determined by management based in part on an independent valuation of assets acquired, which includes intangible assets of approximately   $296.9 million   and relate primarily to tradenames and customer relationships. Intangible assets subject to amortization of approximately   $106.9 million   are being amortized over a   15   year term and relate primarily to customer relationships.   
       
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $4.4 million   of purchase accounting adjustments to goodwill primarily related to the finalization of certain income tax matters. See Note 5 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets." As of June 30, 2016, the Company has finalized its purchase price allocations related to the acquisition of Sequel Naturals Ltd. 
    
  EIEIO 
  On May 29, 2015, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of EIEIO, Inc. ("EIEIO"), the company that owns the Magicow brand and other brands, for   $40.2 million   in cash. We funded this acquisition with borrowings under our credit facility. EIEIO, which is based outside Austin, Texas, manufactures, markets and distributes bulk, bag-in-box and shelf stable creamers, coffee beverages and whip toppings. The acquisition of EIEIO expanded our portfolio of bulk coffee creamer and flavor dispensing products and provided new product capabilities to support growth in our away-from-home channel. EIEIO's results of operations have been included in our condensed consolidated statements of income of our Americas Foods   Beverages segment from the date of acquisition.  
  The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition have been recorded at their fair values. The fair values were determined by management based in part on an independent valuation of assets acquired, which includes intangible assets of approximately   $21.8 million   and relate primarily to tradenames and customer relationships. Intangible assets subject to amortization of approximately   $10.2 million   are being amortized over a   15   year term and relate primarily to customer relationships. As of June 30, 2016, the Company has finalized its purchase price allocations related to the acquisition of EIEIO.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the fiscal 2015 acquisitions.  

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of consideration paid over the net assets acquired and represents synergies, organic growth and other benefits that are expected to arise from integrating the acquired businesses into our operations. Goodwill related to the 2016 and 2015 acquisitions is recorded in the Americas Foods   Beverages segment. Goodwill related to EIEIO and Wallaby is tax deductible. None of the goodwill recorded in the Vega or IPP acquisitions is tax deductible. 
    
  The following table summarizes unaudited supplemental pro forma consolidated results of operations as if we acquired EIEIO, Vega and Wallaby on January 1, 2015. No pro forma unaudited consolidated results of operations is presented for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or the corresponding prior periods related to the IPP acquisition as their results are not material to the condensed consolidated results of the Company. 

The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to the pro forma adjustments. These adjustments are based upon currently available information and certain assumptions. Therefore, the pro forma consolidated results are not necessarily indicative of what the Company s consolidated results of operations actually would have been had it completed the acquisitions on January 1, 2015. The historical results included in the pro forma consolidated results do not purport to project future results of operations of the combined companies nor do they reflect the expected realization of any cost savings or revenue synergies associated with the acquisitions. The pro forma consolidated results reflect purchase accounting adjustments primarily related to depreciation and amortization expense, as well as interest expense, tax expense and acquisition related costs.  

3. Joint Venture with China Mengniu Dairy Company 
  On January 5, 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited ( Mengniu ), a leading Chinese dairy company. The joint venture manufactures, markets and sells a range of premium plant- 
  
   11 

based beverage products in China. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company owns a   49%   stake in the venture while Mengniu owns a   51%   stake.  
  Based on the joint venture agreement, the Company has the ability to exert significant influence over the operations and financial policies of the joint venture and has in-substance common stock in the joint venture. Thus, the joint venture is accounted for as an equity-method investment.   No   contributions were made during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The joint venture has a credit facility with Mengniu of Chinese yuan (CNY)   120 million   (  $18.0 million   USD) and, in 2016, entered into a new credit facility with Mengniu for up to an additional CNY of   90 million   (  $13.5 million   USD), for total capacity of CNY   210 million   (  $31.5 million   USD). The current facility is expected to support its liquidity requirements for 2016. We guarantee up to   49%   on the total commitment amount of this credit facility or Chinese yuan   102.9 million   (  $15.4 million   USD).  As of   September 30, 2016  , the joint venture had borrowed Chinese yuan   190 million   (  $28.5 million   USD) under this facility.

____________________________________ 
   (1) The change in the carrying amount is the result of foreign currency translation and purchase accounting adjustments.   
    
  Amortization expense on finite-lived intangible assets for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $5.2 million   and   $4.9 million  , respectively.  Amortization expense on finite-lived intangible assets for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $15.5 million   and   $10.7 million  , respectively. 
   
  6. Income Taxes 
  For each interim period, the Company estimates the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year and applies that rate to income before income taxes for the period. Additionally, the Company records discrete income tax items in the period in which they are incurred. 
  The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   32.5%   compared to   29.3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   33.2%   compared to   33.1%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in the effective tax rates for the three and nine month comparative periods was due primarily to a decrease in favorable return to provision adjustments in 2015 related to changes in estimates associated with a credit for qualified research activities and an increase in the U.S. manufacturing deduction.  The increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, which were principally driven by an increase in the investment deduction in Belgium and the generally lower foreign tax rates associated with our Vega acquisition. Changes in the relative profitability of our operating segments, as well as changes to federal, state and foreign tax laws may cause the rate to change from historical rates. 

7. Debt and Capital Lease Obligations 
  Our outstanding debt and capital lease obligations as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following:    

____________________________________

  Senior Secured Credit Facilities 
  The Company maintains a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement governs our senior secured credit facilities, consisting of a   five  -year   $1.0 billion   revolving credit facility commitment, a   five  -year   $750 million   term loan A-1, and a   seven  -year   $750 million   term loan A-2.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings of    $1.6 billion   under our   $2.5 billion   senior secured credit facilities consisting of   $157.3 million   outstanding under the revolving credit facility, a   $721.9 million   principal balance under term loan A-1, and a   $744.4 million   principal balance under term loan A-2. We have   $9.0 million   in outstanding letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities.  We have additional borrowing capacity of approximately   $833.7 million   under our senior secured credit facilities, which amount will vary over time depending on our financial covenants and operating performance. 
    
  The senior secured credit facilities are secured by security interests and liens on substantially all of our domestic assets, and are guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries.  As of   September 30, 2016  , borrowings under the revolving credit facility and term loan A-1 bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus   1.75%   and the term loan A-2 at a rate of LIBOR plus   2.00%   per annum.  
  Alpro Revolving Credit Facility 
  On June 29, 2015, Alpro entered into a revolving credit facility not to exceed    30.0 million   or its currency equivalent.  The facility is unsecured and guaranteed by the Company. The facility is available for working capital and other general purposes of Alpro and for the issuance of up to    30.0 million   letters of credit or its currency equivalent. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were no outstanding borrowings. 
  Vega Revolving Credit Facility 
  In April, 2016, Vega increased the limit on its uncommitted revolving credit facility from   $10.0 million   Canadian dollars ("CAD") to not exceed   $15.0 million   CAD. The facility is unsecured and guaranteed by the Company. The facility is available for working capital and other general purposes of Vega. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   outstanding borrowings under this facility.  At   December 31, 2015  , there was   $7.1 million   CAD (  $5.1 million   USD) outstanding in borrowings under the facility.  
  Senior Unsecured Notes 
    In 2014, we issued   $500.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The notes mature on October 1, 2022 and bear interest at a rate of   5.375%   per annum payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year.  
  Capital Lease Obligations 
  We are party to leases of certain operating facilities and equipment under capital lease arrangements which bear interest at rates from   3.1%   to   8.0%   and have expiration dates through   2033  . These assets are included in property, plant, and equipment, net, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
   
  8. Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurement 
  The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations.  The primary risks managed by derivative instruments include interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and commodity price risk.  Derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposure and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
  Credit risk under these arrangements is believed to be remote as the counterparties to the derivatives are major financial institutions; however, if any of the counterparties to the derivative agreements become unable to fulfill their obligation, we may lose the financial benefits of these arrangements. 
  Interest Rates 
  
   14 

In connection with our initial public offering, on October 31, 2012, Dean Foods novated to us certain of its interest rate swaps (the  2017 swaps ) with a notional value of   $650 million   and a maturity date of   March 31, 2017  . The 2017 swaps effectively change the interest payments on a portion of our debt from variable-rate, based on short term LIBOR, to fixed-rate payments.  We are the sole counterparty to the financial institutions under these swap agreements and are directly responsible for any required settlements, and the sole beneficiary of any receipts of funds, pursuant to their terms. We are subject to market risk with respect to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate that impact the fair value of the 2017 swaps. 
  The following table summarizes the terms of the 2017 swap agreements as of   September 30, 2016  : 

We have not designated such contracts as hedging instruments; therefore, the 2017 swap agreements are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and a derivative asset or liability is recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We recorded   gains  /(losses) on these contracts of   $0.5 million   and   $(2.1) million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , losses on these contracts were   $2.3 million   and   $7.1 million  , respectively. Gains and losses are recorded in other expense, net in our condensed consolidated statements of income. A summary of these open swap agreements recorded at fair value in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is included in the fair value table below. 
    
  Commodities 
  We are exposed to commodity price fluctuations, including organic and conventional milk, butterfat, almonds, organic and non-genetically modified ( non-GMO ) soybeans, coconut, cashews, sweeteners, and other commodity costs used in the manufacturing, packaging, and distribution of our products, including utilities, natural gas, resin, and diesel fuel. To secure adequate supplies of materials and bring greater stability to the cost of ingredients and their related manufacturing, packaging, and distribution, we routinely enter into forward purchase contracts and other purchase arrangements with suppliers. Under the forward purchase contracts, we commit to purchasing agreed-upon quantities of ingredients and commodities at agreed-upon prices at specified future dates. The outstanding purchase commitment for these commodities at any point in time typically ranges from   one month   s to   eighteen month's   anticipated requirements, depending on the ingredient or commodity, but can be longer in limited cases. These contracts are considered normal purchases.   
  In addition to entering into forward purchase contracts, from time to time we may purchase over-the-counter hedge contracts from qualified financial institutions for commodities associated with the production and distribution of our products. Certain of these contracts offset the risk of increases in our commodity costs and are designated as cash flow hedges when appropriate. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have not entered into any commodity cash flow hedges.  
  Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company s exposure to commodity price risk but do not meet the authoritative guidance for hedge accounting. From time to time, the Company enters into commodity forward contracts to fix the price of natural gas and diesel fuel purchases and other commodities at a future delivery date. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded to cost of sales and selling, distribution, and marketing expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of income depending on commodity type. We recorded gains/(losses) on these contracts of   $(0.9) million   and   $1.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded losses of   $8.0 million   and   $8.9 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding contracts for the purchase of   19.9 million   gallons of diesel expiring throughout 2016 and 2017. A summary of our open commodities contracts recorded at fair value in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is included in the table below. 
  Although we may utilize forward purchase contracts and other instruments to mitigate the risks related to commodity price fluctuation, such strategies do not fully mitigate commodity price risk. Adverse movements in commodity prices over the terms of the contracts or instruments could decrease the economic benefits we derive from these strategies.  
  Foreign Currency 
  Our international operations represented approximately   19%   of net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Sales in foreign countries, as well as certain expenses related to those sales, are transacted in currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily consists of the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and Chinese yuan related to net sales and expenses in currencies other than the functional  
  
   15 

currency of the business. We may, from time to time, employ derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates or enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge our net investment and intercompany payable or receivable balances in foreign operations. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded as an asset or liability in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent the hedge is effective. Derivative gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified into earnings as the underlying transaction occurs. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had an aggregate U.S. dollar equivalent of   $256.3 million   of U.S. dollar foreign currency contracts outstanding, expiring throughout 2016 and 2017 for an intercompany note receivable and commodity purchases denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.  Any ineffectiveness in our foreign currency exchange hedges is recorded as an adjustment to cost of goods sold in our condensed consolidated statements of income. There was no material hedge ineffectiveness related to our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Fair Value - Derivatives 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , derivatives recorded at fair value in our condensed consolidated balance sheets were as follows: 

____________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Derivative assets and liabilities that have settlement dates equal to or less than 12 months from the respective balance sheet date were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
              (2) 
    Derivative assets and liabilities that have settlement dates greater than 12 months from the respective balance sheet date were included in identifiable intangible and other assets, net and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
              (3) 
    $1.6 million   of the derivative asset balance as of September, 30 2016 relates to a foreign currency hedge on an intercompany note for which the change in fair value offsets the impact of the note being re-measured into the functional currency. 
       
  Gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

____________________________________ 
     (1)    Recorded in cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of income. See Note 10 "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss."  
  Based on current exchange rates, we estimate that $  1.8 million   in net   gains   of hedging activity related to our foreign currency contracts will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to operating results within the next 12 months. 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  
   16 

Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering assumptions, we follow a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
                
    Level 2   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations, in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. 
                
    Level 3   Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
       
  A summary of our financial assets and liabilities subject to recurring fair value measurements and the basis for that measurement according to the levels in the fair value hierarchy as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows: 

____________________________________ 
     (1)    Change in value since December 31, 2015 due to foreign currency translation.    
    
  There were no transfers between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

17 

We sponsor   two   deferred compensation plans, Pre-2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and Post-2004 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, under which certain employees with a base compensation of at least   $150,000   may elect to defer receiving payment for a portion of their salary and bonus until periods after their retirements or upon separation from service. The investments are classified as trading securities and the assets related to these plans are primarily invested in money mutual funds and are held at fair value. We classify these assets as Level 2 as fair value can be corroborated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active. Changes in the fair value are recorded in general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income.  
    
    Additionally, we maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ( SERP ), which is a nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement for our executive officers and other employees earning compensation in excess of the maximum compensation that can be taken into account with respect to our 401(k) plan. The SERP is designed to provide these employees with retirement benefits that are equivalent, as a percentage of total compensation, to the benefits provided to other employees. The investments are classified as trading securities and are primarily invested in money market funds and held at fair value. We classify these assets as Level 1 as fair value can be corroborated based on quoted market prices for identical instruments in active markets. Changes in the fair value are recorded in general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income.  
    
  Our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalent money market funds.  Due to their near-term maturities, the carrying amounts of trade accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered equivalent to fair value.  In addition, because the interest rates on our senior secured credit facilities are variable, their fair values approximate their carrying values. 
    
  We estimate the fair value of our senior unsecured notes primarily using quoted market prices in markets that are not active. As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value and fair value of the Company's borrowings was   $500.0 million   and   $570.0 million  , respectively. See Note 7 "Debt and Capital Lease Obligations."  As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value and fair value of the Company's borrowings was   $500.0 million   and   $521.3 million  , respectively. If measured at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, our senior unsecured notes would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
    
  The fair value of our interest rate swaps is determined based on the notional amounts of the swaps and the forward LIBOR curve relative to the fixed interest rates under the swap agreements.  The fair value of our commodities contracts is based on the quantities and fixed prices under the agreements and quoted forward commodity prices.  The fair value of our foreign currency contracts is based on the notional amounts and rates under the contracts and observable market forward exchange rates.  We classify these instruments in Level 2 because quoted market prices can be corroborated utilizing observable benchmark market rates at commonly quoted intervals and observable market transactions of spot currency rates and forward currency prices.  We did not significantly change our valuation techniques from prior periods. 
  Our qualified pension plan investments are comprised of qualifying insurance policies and the guaranteed premiums are invested in the general assets of the insurance company. We classify these assets as Level 3 as there is little or no market data to support the fair value.  The qualifying insurance policies are valued at the amount guaranteed by the insurer to pay out the insured benefits. The funding policy is to contribute assets at least equal in amount to regulatory minimum requirements. Funding is based on legal requirements, tax considerations, and investment opportunities. See Note 11  Employee Retirement Plans.   

9. Share-Based Compensation 
  Under the Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2012 SIP"), a total of   26,850,000   shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock units ( RSUs ), performance stock units ("PSUs") or restricted stock awards that may be issued to our employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The 2012 SIP also permits awards of stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) and phantom shares as part of our long-term incentive compensation program. In general, awards granted to our employees under the 2012 SIP vest one-third on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third on the second anniversary of the grant date, and one-third on the third anniversary of the grant date. Unvested awards vest immediately in the following circumstances: (i) an employee retires after reaching the age of   65  , (ii) in certain cases upon an employee s death or qualified disability, (iii) an employee with   10   years of service retires after reaching the age of   55  , or (vi) upon a change of control, except for PSUs and all equity awards granted after 2014 to the Company's executive officers. 
  Upon the completion of the acquisition of the Company by Danone S.A., all of the Company's outstanding share-based compensation awards will vest.  See Note 16   The Proposed Merger with Danone   for further discussion. 
  
   18 

Share-Based Compensation Expense 
  The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense recognized for the Company s equity and liability classified plans in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Share-based compensation expense is recorded within general and administrative expense.  Except for PSUs, this expense is recognized one-third on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third on the second anniversary of the grant date, and one-third on the third anniversary of the grant date, unless the employee has reached the retirement age of   65   or is   55   years of age and has   10   years of service, in which case all share-based compensation expense is recognized at the time of grant. 
    
  Stock Options 
  Under the terms of the 2012 SIP, our employees may be granted options to purchase our common stock at a price equal to the market price on the date the option is granted. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions:    

Since the Company s common stock did not have a long history of being publicly traded at grant date, the expected term was determined under the simplified method, using an average of the contractual term and vesting period of the stock options. For stock options granted in 2015 and thereafter, the expected volatility assumption was calculated based on a blend of compensation peer group analysis of stock price volatility with a   six  -year look back period ending on the grant date, and the Company's current implied stock price volatility. For stock options granted prior to 2015, the expected volatility assumption was calculated based solely on a compensation peer group analysis of stock price volatility with a   six  -year look back period ending on the grant date. The risk-free rates were based on the average implied yield available on   five  -year and   seven  -year U.S. Treasury issues. The forfeiture rates are based on historical rates and the Company elected to use a   0%   forfeiture rate due to historically immaterial forfeiture rates. We have not paid, and do not anticipate paying, a cash dividend on our common stock. 
  The following table summarizes stock option activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 
  
   19 

____________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Pursuant to the terms of the 2012 SIP, options that are forfeited, canceled or expired may be available for future grants; however     shares delivered to or withheld by the Company for the payment of the exercise price of an option and/or tax withholding related to an exercise, and shares subject to an option that are not issued upon the net exercise of such option, are not added back to the pool of shares available for future awards. 
     During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we received   $9.4 million   of cash from stock option exercises. At   September 30, 2016  , there is   $8.4 million   of unrecognized stock option expense, all of which is related to non-vested awards. This compensation expense is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of   1.66   years. 
  Restricted Stock Units 
  RSUs are issued to certain senior employees under the 2012 SIP as part of our long-term incentive program. An RSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock in the future. RSUs have   no   exercise price. RSUs granted to employees vest ratably over   three years  . 
    
  The following table summarizes RSU activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

__________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Pursuant to the terms of the 2012 SIP, RSUs that are canceled or forfeited before they vest may be available for future grants; however     shares delivered to or withheld by the Company for the payment of the employee's tax withholding related to an RSU vesting are not added back to the pool of shares available for future awards. 
     At   September 30, 2016  , there is   $14.1 million   of total unrecognized RSU expense, all of which is related to unvested awards. This compensation expense is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of   1.68   years. 
    
  Performance Stock Units 
  In February 2015 and 2016, we granted PSUs to our executive officers under the 2012 SIP as part of our long-term incentive compensation program. PSUs vest based on a comparison of the Company s diluted adjusted EPS growth over the   three  -year performance period to the diluted adjusted EPS growth of companies in the S P 500 over the same period.  In the first year, one third of the PSUs will vest based on our diluted adjusted EPS growth in that year compared to the   one  -year diluted adjusted EPS growth of S P 500 companies.  In the second year, one third of the PSUs will vest based on our cumulative diluted adjusted EPS growth over the past two years compared to the cumulative   two  -year diluted adjusted EPS growth of S P 500 companies.  In the third year, one third of the PSUs will vest based on our cumulative diluted adjusted EPS growth over the past three years compared to the cumulative three-year diluted adjusted EPS growth of S P 500 companies.  PSUs will be converted to common stock upon vesting and the payout range is   0   to   200%  .  
  
   20 

We recognize share-based compensation expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income over the   three   year performance period based on the Company s estimated relative performance for each vesting tranche. Accordingly, for the grant made each year we recognize   100%   of the estimated first year expense,   50%   of the estimated second year expense and   33.3%   of the estimated third year expense. As of   September 30, 2016  , based upon our assessment of our relative performance versus the S P 500, the 2015 PSU awards have been expensed based upon a target payout   188%   for the year two tranche (2015-2016) and   158%   for the year three tranche (2015-2017).  As of   September 30, 2016  , the 2016 PSU awards have been expensed based upon a target payout assumption of   175%   for year one tranche (2016-2017),   138%   for tranche year two (2016-2018), and   125%   for tranche year three (2016-2019). 
    
  The following table summarizes PSU activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

__________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Pursuant to the terms of the 2012 SIP, PSUs that are canceled or forfeited before they vest may be available for future grants; however shares delivered to or withheld by the Company for the payment of the employee's tax withholding related to a PSU vesting are not added back to the pool of shares available for future awards. Shares issued upon vesting of PSUs on April 18, 2016 were   71,580  , which represented   200%   payout. 
     At   September 30, 2016   there is   $2.3 million   of total unrecognized PSU expense, all of which is related to unvested awards. This compensation expense is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of   1.40   years. 
    
  Phantom Shares 
  We previously granted phantom shares under the 2012 SIP as part of our long-term incentive compensation program, which are similar to RSUs in that they are based on the price of WhiteWave stock and vest ratably over a   three  -year period, but are cash-settled based upon the value of WhiteWave stock at each vesting period. The fair value of the awards was re-measured at each reporting period. As of March 31, 2016 all phantom shares have been cash settled. 
    
  Stock Appreciation Rights 
  We previously granted SARs under the 2012 SIP as part of our long-term incentive compensation program, which are similar to stock options in that they are based on the price of WhiteWave stock and vest ratably over a   three  -year period, but are cash-settled based upon the value of WhiteWave stock at the exercise date. We have not granted any SARs since 2013 and all outstanding SARs are fully vested. 
    
         The fair value of the awards is re-measured at each reporting period. A liability has been recorded in current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets totaling   $1.8 million   and   $2.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The following table summarizes SARs activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :

    Pursuant to the terms of the 2012 SIP, SARs that are canceled or forfeited may be available for future grants. 

10. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
    
  The changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows (net of tax):

  11. Employee Retirement Plans 
  We provide employee retirement benefits under 401(k) and defined benefit plans. Additionally, we contribute to   one   multi-employer pension plan on behalf of certain employees.  We have defined benefit pension plans for certain of our Europe Foods and Beverages segment employees, under which the benefits are based on years of service and employee compensation. 
  The components of net periodic benefit cost for our pension plans for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are detailed below: 

12. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Lease and Purchase Obligations 
  We lease certain property, plant, and equipment used in our operations under both capital and operating lease agreements. Such operating leases, which are primarily for operating facilities, office space, and equipment, have lease terms ranging from   one   to   14   years. Rent expense was   $9.4 million   and   $8.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $27.5 million   and   $18.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company leases certain operating facilities and equipment under capital lease arrangements. These assets are included in property, plant, and equipment, net, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  We have entered into various contracts, in the normal course of business, obligating us to purchase minimum quantities of raw materials used in our production and distribution processes, including soybeans and organic raw milk. We enter into these  
  
   23 

contracts from time to time to ensure a sufficient supply of raw materials. In addition, we have contractual obligations to purchase various services that are part of our production and distribution process. 
  Litigation, Investigations, and Audits 
  The Company is involved in various litigation, investigations, and audit proceedings in the normal course of business. It is management s opinion, after consultation with counsel and a review of the facts, that a material adverse effect on the financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, or cash flows of the Company is not probable or reasonably possible. 
   
  13. Segment, Geographic, and Customer Information 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, we report results of operations through   two   reportable segments: Americas Foods   Beverages and Europe Foods   Beverages. This reporting structure aligns with the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), our CEO, monitors operating performance, allocates resources, and deploys capital.  In 2015, we reported results of operations through   three   reportable segments: Americas Foods   Beverages, Americas Fresh Foods and Europe Foods   Beverages.  In connection with our management restructure in early 2016, we consolidated the historical Americas Foods   Beverages and Americas Fresh Foods segments into a single Americas Foods   Beverages segment.  Accordingly, prior year segment data has been recast to reflect this new segment structure.    
  The Americas Foods   Beverages segment offers products in the plant-based foods and beverages, coffee creamers and beverages, premium dairy products and organic produce categories throughout North America. Our Europe Foods   Beverages segment offers plant-based food and beverage products throughout Europe. We sell our products to a variety of customers, including grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, health food stores and convenience stores, as well as various away-from-home channels, including foodservice outlets, across North America and Europe. We sell our products in North America and Europe primarily through our direct sales force, independent brokers, regional brokers, and distributors. We utilize   twelve   manufacturing plants, multiple distribution centers, and   three   strategic co-packers across North America. Additionally, we have   three   plants across Europe in the United Kingdom, Belgium and France, each supported by an integrated supply chain. We also utilize third-party co-packers across Europe for certain products. 
  We evaluate the performance of our segments based on net sales and operating income. The amounts in the following tables are obtained from reports used by our chief operating decision maker. There are no significant non-cash items reported in segment profit or loss other than depreciation and amortization. 
  Expense related to share-based compensation has not been allocated to our segments and is reflected entirely within the caption  Corporate and other . 
    
  The following table presents the summarized income statement amounts by segment:

Significant Customers 
  The Company had a single customer that represented   13.7%   and   14.0%   of its consolidated net sales in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The same customer represented   13.0%   and   13.9%   of our consolidated net sales in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Sales to this customer are primarily included in the Americas Foods   Beverages segment. 
   
  14. Earnings Per Share 
  Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the effect of all dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during each period.  
    
  The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators used in the computations of both basic and diluted earnings per share:

15. Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information 
    
  In September of 2014, we issued debt securities that are guaranteed by certain of our   100%   owned subsidiaries.  In accordance with Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, the following condensed consolidating financial statements present the balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the statements of comprehensive income for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, and the statements of cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 for The WhiteWave Foods Company (referred to as  Parent  for the purpose of this note only), the combined guarantor subsidiaries, the combined non-guarantor subsidiaries and elimination adjustments necessary to arrive at the information for the Parent, guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity method for this presentation. All guarantors of our debt securities are also guarantors for our senior secured credit facilities. The guarantee is full and unconditional and joint and several. Our senior secured credit facilities are secured by security interest and liens on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries and is presented in the Parent column of the accompanying condensed consolidating balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

16. The Proposed Merger with Danone 
  On July 6, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Danone, and July Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Danone ( Merger Sub ). 

35 

The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the  Merger ) with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the Merger, the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Danone. At the effective time of the Merger (the  Effective Time ), each share of common stock of the Company, par value   $0.01   per share, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Danone or any of its subsidiaries (including Merger Sub)), will automatically be canceled for no consideration, and converted into the right to receive   $56.25   in cash, without interest. 
    
  If the Merger Agreement were to be terminated in specified circumstances, the Company would be required to pay Danone a termination fee of   $310.0 million  . These circumstances include if the merger agreement were terminated because closing has not occurred by the specified long stop date (subject to applicable extensions) or because WhiteWave has breached its obligations under the agreement, and a Company takeover proposal has been made for WhiteWave which is not publicly withdrawn as of the date of termination, and prior to the first anniversary of such termination WhiteWave enters into a definitive agreement with respect to or consummates a Company takeover proposal. 
    
  On October 4, 2016 stockholders approved our merger agreement with Danone. The closing of the merger remains subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act ( HSR ) and approval of the merger by the European Commission pursuant to the EU Merger Regulation.  On October 3, 2016, the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) issued a request for additional information, commonly known as a  second request,  which extends the HSR waiting period until the 30   th    calendar day after the date that both parties substantially comply with the second request, unless the waiting period terminates earlier.  On October 26, 2016, Danone filed its Form CO with the European Commission. WhiteWave and Danone continue to work with the DOJ and the European Commission to obtain regulatory clearance and approval. We currently expect closing to occur in first quarter 2017, though there can be no assurance regarding timing of completion of regulatory processes. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company has incurred   $7.5 million   of transaction costs related to the planned Merger with Danone, which were recorded in general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income.

  Overview of the Business 
  We are a leading consumer packaged food and beverage company focused on high-growth product categories that are aligned with emerging consumer trends. We manufacture, market and sell branded plant-based foods and beverages, coffee creamers and beverages, premium dairy products and organic produce. We sell products primarily in North America, Europe and through a joint venture in China. We focus on providing consumers with innovative, great-tasting food and beverage choices that meet their increasing desires for nutritious, flavorful, convenient, and responsibly-produced products. Our widely-recognized, leading brands distributed in North America include   Silk  ,   So Delicious   and   Vega   plant-based foods and beverages,   International Delight   and   LAND O LAKES   coffee creamers and beverages,   Horizon Organic   and   Wallaby Organic   premium dairy products and   Earthbound Farm   organic salads, fruits and vegetables. Our popular plant-based foods and beverages brands in Europe include   Alpro   and   Provamel  .   
  Effective January 1, 2016, we report our results of operations through   two   reportable segments: Americas Foods   Beverages and Europe Foods   Beverages. This reporting structure aligns with the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), our CEO, monitors operating performance, allocates resources, and deploys capital.  In 2015, we reported results of operations through   three   reportable segments: Americas Foods   Beverages, Americas Fresh Foods and Europe Foods   Beverages.  In connection with our management restructure in early 2016, we consolidated the historical Americas Foods   Beverages and Americas Fresh Foods segments into a single Americas Foods   Beverages segment.  Accordingly, prior year segment data has been recast to reflect this new segment structure.    
  We sell our products to a variety of customers, including grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, health food stores and convenience stores, as well as through various away-from-home channels, including foodservice outlets. We sell our products primarily through our direct sales force, independent brokers, regional brokers and distributors. 
  We have an extensive production and supply chain footprint and we utilize   twelve   production facilities and also rely on third-party co-packers to fulfill our manufacturing needs in North America and Latin America.

Furthermore, we utilize a broad commercial partner network to access certain markets in Europe, in addition to our own sales organizations in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. 
    
  Recent Developments 
  On July 6, 2016, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Danone S.A., a   soci t  anonyme   ("Danone") under which Danone will acquire the Company for $56.25 per share in an all-cash transaction.  The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both companies. On October 4, 2016 stockholders approved our merger agreement with  
  
   37 

Danone. The closing of the merger remains subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act ( HSR ) and approval of the merger by the European Commission pursuant to the EU Merger Regulation.  On October 3, 2016, the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) issued a request for additional information, commonly known as a  second request,  which extends the HSR waiting period until the 30   th    calendar day after the date that both parties substantially comply with the second request, unless the waiting period terminates earlier.  On October 26, 2016, Danone filed its Form CO with the European Commission. WhiteWave and Danone continue to work with the DOJ and the European Commission to obtain regulatory clearance and approval. We currently expect closing to occur in first quarter 2017, though there can be no assurance regarding timing of completion of regulatory processes. 
   For additional information regarding the Company and Danone transaction, see Note 16 to the condensed consolidated financial statements within Item 1 of this report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Factors Affecting Our Business and Results of Operations 
  The following trends have impacted our sales and operating income over the past two years and we believe that they will continue to be factors affecting our business and results of operations in the future: 
  Acquisitions and Joint Venture 
  We have grown and may continue to grow our business in part by acquiring new brands and businesses, and forming joint ventures, both in the United States and globally. The addition of acquisitions or joint ventures allows us to leverage our resources and capabilities but can also divert resources and management attention from our day-to-day operations as we integrate them into existing operations.  
  New Product Introductions 
    
  We intend to continue to respond to evolving consumer preferences by delivering innovative products. We have a proven track record of innovation through either creating or largely developing our subcategories and we continue to focus on innovation that we believe will drive increased consumption of our products. 
    
  Volatility in Commodity Costs 
    
  Our business is heavily dependent on raw materials and other inputs, such as organic and conventional raw milk, butterfat, almonds, organic and non-genetically modified ( non-GMO ) soybeans, coconut, cashews, sweeteners, organic salads, fruits and vegetables, and other commodity costs used in the manufacturing, packaging, and distribution of our products, including utilities, natural gas, resin and diesel fuel. Changes in the costs of raw materials and other inputs historically impacted, and are expected to continue to impact our profitability. Increases in commodity costs have led, and in the future could lead, to price increases across our portfolio to mitigate the impacts of these increased costs. 
  Consumer Preferences for Nutritious, Flavorful, Convenient, and Responsibly Produced Products 
    
  The plant-based foods and beverages, organic salads, fruits and vegetables, coffee creamers and beverages, and premium dairy categories are aligned with emerging consumer preferences for products that are nutritious, flavorful, convenient, and responsibly produced. As a result, we believe these product categories will continue to offer attractive growth opportunities relative to traditional food and beverage categories. Our plant-based foods and beverages and premium dairy products are well positioned within the dairy and dairy alternatives sector, as well as the organic sector. The growth of the organic sector is outpacing the growth of the overall food and beverage industry. In addition, our coffee creamers and beverages continue to benefit from the growth and overall size of the coffee creamers sector. 
  Manufacturing and Warehousing Capacity Constraints 
    
  Our volume growth has required production levels and warehousing above our historical internal capacity. In response, we have relied on our third-party network for some production, which has resulted in higher costs for the production, distribution, and warehousing of our products. In addition, capacity constraints sometimes create the need for us to shift production between internal facilities, which increases overall shipping and warehousing costs. We have increased and are  
  
   38 

increasing internal capacity and will continue to both shift production between internal facilities and utilize our co-packing network, as needed, to meet our production and warehousing requirements.  
  Matters Affecting Comparability 
    
  Our results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were affected by the following: 
       
  Acquisitions of IPP, Wallaby, Vega and EIEIO 
    
  On June 2, 2016, the Company acquired Innovation Packaging and Process, S.A. DE C.V. ("IPP"). Founded in 2007, IPP is an aseptic beverage co-packer based in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. We funded this acquisition through cash provided from operations. The Company purchased IPP for total cash consideration of   $18.1 million  . Our preliminary purchase price allocation includes goodwill of   $12.3 million  , property, plant, and equipment of   $9.1 million  , intangible assets subject to amortization of   $0.6 million   related to customer relationships, and liabilities assumed net of working capital items of   $3.9 million  . Customer relationships are being amortized over a   3   year term. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition have been recorded at their preliminary fair values. Certain estimated values for the acquisition are not yet finalized pending the final purchase price allocations, and as a result, the Company's estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period as valuations are finalized. We have included IPP's results of operations in our condensed consolidated statements of income in our Americas Foods   Beverages segment from the date of acquisition.  
    
  On August 30, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Wallaby Yogurt Company, Inc. ("Wallaby") for approximately $122.4 million in cash. We funded this acquisition with borrowings under our credit facility. We have included Wallaby's results of operations in our condensed consolidated statements of income in our Americas Foods   Beverages segment from the date of acquisition. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition have been recorded at their fair values. The fair values were determined by management based in part on an independent valuation of assets acquired, which includes estimated intangible assets of approximately $57.1 million and relate primarily to tradenames. Intangible assets subject to amortization of approximately $9.1 million are being amortized over a   15   year term and relate primarily to customer relationships. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $6.3 million   of purchase accounting adjustments to goodwill primarily related to the finalization of the fair value of certain intangible assets. 
    
  On August 1, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Sequel Naturals Ltd, the company that owns the Vega brand ("Vega") and is a pioneer and leader in plant-based nutrition products, for approximately $553.6 million in cash funded by borrowings under our credit facility. We have included Vega's results of operations in our condensed consolidated statements of income in our Americas Foods   Beverages segment from the date of acquisition.  The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition have been recorded at their fair values. The fair values were determined by management based in part on an independent valuation of assets acquired, which includes intangible assets of approximately $296.9 million and relate primarily to tradenames and customer relationships. Intangible assets subject to amortization of approximately $106.9 million are being amortized over a   15   year term and relate primarily to customer relationships. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $4.4 million   of purchase accounting adjustments to goodwill primarily related to the finalization of certain income tax matters. 
    
  On May 29, 2015, the Company acquired substantially all the assets and liabilities of EIEIO, Inc. ("EIEIO"), which owns the Magicow brand as well as other brands, for   $40.2 million   in cash. We funded this acquisition with borrowings under our credit facility.  The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition have been recorded at their fair values. The fair values were determined by management based in part on an independent valuation of assets acquired, which includes intangible assets of approximately   $21.8 million   and relate primarily to tradenames. Intangible assets subject to amortization of approximately   $10.2 million   are being amortized over a   15   year term and relate primarily to customer relationships. We have included EIEIO's results of operations in our condensed consolidated statements of income in our Americas Foods   Beverages segment from the date of acquisition.  
    
  Foreign Exchange Movements 
    
  Due to the international aspect of our business, our net sales and expenses are influenced by foreign exchange movements. Our exposures to foreign exchange rates are primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and  
  
   39 

Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar. The financial statements of our Europe Foods   Beverages segment are translated to U.S. dollars. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency of the country of our subsidiary. Accordingly, income and expense items are translated at the average rates prevailing during the period. Changes in exchange rates that affect cash flows and the related receivables or payables are recognized as transaction gains and losses and are recorded in general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  The following table presents, for the periods indicated, selected information from our condensed consolidated financial results, including information presented as a percentage of net sales (note: totals may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding): 

____________________________________ 
           (1) 
    We include certain shipping and handling costs within selling, distribution, and marketing expense. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to other companies that present all shipping and handling costs as a component of cost of sales. 
     The key performance indicators for our reportable segments are net sales, gross profit, and operating income, which are presented in the segment results tables and discussion below. 
    
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Consolidated Results 
  Total net sales     Total net sales by segment are shown in the table below (note: totals may not sum due to rounding): 

The changes in total net sales were due to the following (note: totals may not sum due to rounding): 
  
   40 

Total net sales     Consolidated total net sales   increased     $49.7 million  , or   5.0%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . This   increase   was driven by acquisitions within the last year, which contributed   2.6   percentage points of growth, along with organic growth that was largely volume driven with an additional contribution from a favorable mix.  The increase was partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact of approximately 90 basis points. 
  Cost of sales     Cost of sales   increased     $19.7 million  , or   3.0%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . This   increase   was principally driven by higher sales volumes, including the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by lower raw material costs, $1.2 million of foreign currency translation, and $  0.4 million   of mark-to-market   gains   on commodity hedges compared to   losses   of   $1.1 million   in the same period of 2015.  
  Gross profit     Gross profit margin   increased   to   36.2%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   35.0%   for the same period in   2015   as an increase in the Americas Foods   Beverages segment offset the currency related decline in the Europe Foods   Beverages segment.  Currency impact reduced gross margin by approximately 40 basis points. 
  Operating expenses     Total operating expenses   increased     $13.8 million  , or   5.3%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  
  Selling, distribution and marketing expense   increased     $1.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . This   increase   was driven primarily by volume related growth in selling expense, including incremental growth from acquisitions, which was partially offset by   $1.4 million   of   gains   on commodity hedges compared to   losses   of   $2.9 million   in 2015, as well as cost savings in both the Americas Foods   Beverages and Europe Foods   Beverages segments. 
    
  General and administrative expense   increased     $12.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , due principally to the impact of acquisitions, as well as higher employee-related costs.  Costs related to management of our joint venture investment in China was   $0.8 million   compared to   $1.1 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . During the third quarter of 2016, we incurred   $1.2 million   of integration costs related to acquisitions, down from   $2.1 million   incurred in the same quarter of 2015.  Also during the quarter, we incurred   $7.6 million   of transaction costs related to the planned merger with Danone and other merger and acquisition activities compared to   $7.0 million   of transaction costs related to acquisitions in the same quarter of 2015. Offsetting the prior year transaction costs related to acquisitions was a   $7.9 million   gain recognized on the negotiated purchase price settlement of the Earthbound Farm acquisition that occurred after purchase accounting was closed. 
  Interest and other expenses, net     Interest and other expenses, net for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $1.0 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . The   increase   was primarily driven by higher debt levels outstanding during the quarter due to the acquisitions completed in 2015 and continued capital investments.  These   increases   were partially offset by a mark-to-market gain on our interest rate swaps of   $0.5 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to a   $2.3 million   mark-to-market loss in the same quarter of   2015  .  
  Income tax expense     The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   32.5%   compared to   29.3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a decrease in favorable return to provision adjustments in 2015 related to changes in estimates associated with a credit for qualified research activities and an increase in the U.S. manufacturing deduction. The increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, which were principally driven by an increase in the investment deduction in Belgium and the generally lower foreign tax rates associated with our Vega acquisition. Changes in the relative profitability of our operating segments, as well as changes to federal, state and foreign tax laws may cause the rate to change from historical rates.

Loss in equity method investments     Our share of the loss related to the China joint venture was   $2.2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.5 million   in the same period of   2015  . Our share of the loss related to our other equity investment was   $0.3 million   and   $0.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Americas Foods   Beverages Segment Results 
  The following table presents certain financial information concerning our Americas Foods   Beverages segment s financial results (note: totals may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding):    

Total net sales     Total net sales   increased     $40.4 million  , or   4.6%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . This   increase   was driven by acquisitions within the last year, which contributed   $25.7 million   in net sales in the quarter, and organic growth from a favorable mix that was partially offset by pricing. These   increases   were partially offset by a $0.1 million unfavorable impact of currency translation driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso. 
  Net sales in the Plant-based Foods and Beverages platform   increased     9.7%   behind contributions from acquisitions and organic growth.  The acquisitions of Vega and IPP contributed 6.1 percentage points of growth. Organic growth was driven by increased sales of plant-based yogurts, frozen desserts, and nutritional offerings, which was partially offset by a decline in soy beverages of $4.6 million. Sales and market share performance in plant-based beverages were hampered by a transition to new Silk packaging designs that negatively impacted shelf presence and brand shoppability, along with a significant increase in competitive promotional and marketing activity during the quarter. 
  Net sales in the Coffee Creamers and Beverages platform   increased     8.9%  . This growth was primarily driven by higher volumes from new product introductions, including Stok cold-brew coffees and new flavors of International Delight iced-coffees, along with increases in flavored creamers, plant-based creamers and organic dairy creamers driven by expanded distribution and increased velocities. 
  Premium Dairy platform net sales increased   5.3%  .  This growth was principally driven by the acquisition of Wallaby, which contributed 5.3 percentage points of growth. Net sales across the balance of the platform were essentially flat compared to the prior year period and in line with management expectations due to continued historically high price gaps to conventional milks. 
    
  Fresh Foods platform sales   decreased     12.8%   primarily due to supply chain-related constraints hampering order fulfillment in the quarter, along with continued lower retail distribution levels following the SAP implementation-related business disruptions experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015. The platform continues to focus on supply chain enhancements and customer service improvements to rebuild distribution levels. 
  Cost of sales     Cost of sales   increased     $10.3 million  , or   1.8%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . This   increase   was driven by the impact of acquisitions, along with underlying volume increases, partially offset by decreases in commodity costs including   $0.4 million   of gains on our commodity hedges compared to losses of   $1.1 million   in the same period of 2015.  
  
   42 

Gross profit     Gross profit margin   increased     180   basis points to   35.3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The   increase   was primarily driven by a favorable product mix, including the impact of acquisitions, and lower commodity costs. 
  Operating expenses     Operating expenses   increased     $4.4 million  , or   2.2%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. This   increase   was primarily due to incremental expenses attributable to acquisitions and higher employee-related costs, partially offset by lower distribution expense and other cost saving initiatives.  During the quarter, we incurred   $0.8 million   of integration costs related to acquisitions, compared to   $2.0 million   in the same period of 2015.  
    
  Europe Foods   Beverages Segment Results 
  The following table presents certain financial information concerning our Europe Foods   Beverages segment s financial results (note: totals may not sum due to rounding): 

Total net sales     Net sales   increased     $9.3 million  , or   6.9%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The   increase   was driven principally by continued strong volume growth led by increases in nut-based, coconut and oat beverages, and strong growth in plant-based yogurts. Net sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation, which reduced growth by 6.4 percentage points.  
  Cost of sales     Cost of sales   increased     $9.3 million  , or   12.5%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   driven by higher sales volumes, unfavorable mix and higher depreciation, which was partially offset by cost leverage from increased internal production and currency translation which decreased cost of sales by $1.1 million.    
  Gross profit     Gross profit margin   decreased   to   41.9%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   44.7%   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to currency translation which had an unfavorable impact of approximately 250 basis points, as well as higher levels depreciation expense and warehousing costs.  
  Operating expenses     Operating expenses   increased     $1.7 million  , or   4.1%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The   increase   was primarily driven by higher general and administrative expenses as a result of investments in personnel and infrastructure, and higher distribution costs due to increased volumes that was largely offset by efficiencies from greater levels of internal production.   

Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  Consolidated Results 
  Total net sales     Total net sales by segment are shown in the table below (note: totals may not sum due to rounding): 

The changes in total net sales were due to the following (note: totals may not sum due to rounding): 
  
   43 

Total net sales     Consolidated total net sales   increased     $304.3 million  , or   10.7%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . This increase was driven by a combination of acquisitions within the last year, which contributed   5.4   percentage points of growth, and organic growth that was largely volume driven with additional contributions from pricing and a favorable mix.  The increase was partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact of approximately 65 basis points. 
  Cost of sales     Cost of sales   increased     $184.8 million  , or   10.0%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . This   increase   was principally driven by higher sales volumes, including the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by $2.3 million of foreign currency translation and   $3.1 million   of gains on our commodity hedges compared to   $0.3 million   in the same period of 2015. Costs were also impacted by the $2.2 million first quarter 2016 write-off of a warehouse in the Europe Foods   Beverages segment and   $10.2 million   of costs related to the SAP implementation within the Fresh Foods platform in the Americas Foods   Beverages segment. 
  Gross profit     Gross profit margin   increased   to   35.2%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   34.7%   for the same period in   2015  .  This   increase   was primarily driven by a favorable mix of products sold, increased costs leverage from higher volumes, including a margin benefit from acquisitions, partly offset by currency impacts that reduced gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. 
  Operating expenses     Total operating expenses   increased     $65.6 million  , or   8.8%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  
  Selling, distribution and marketing expense   increased     $33.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . This   increase   was driven primarily by an increase in distribution and selling costs driven by higher sales volumes, including the impact of acquisitions, along with higher marketing expenses. These increases were partially offset by   $7.3 million   of gains on our commodity hedges compared to   $0.7 million   in the same period of 2015. 
    
  General and administrative expense   increased     $32.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , due principally to the impact of acquisitions and higher employee-related costs. Cost related to management of our joint venture investment in China was   $2.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $5.9 million   of integration costs related to acquisition activities, of which   $1.9 million   related to the SAP implementation within the Fresh Foods platform, compared to   $6.9 million   of integration costs related to acquisitions in the same period of 2015. Also during the nine months ended September 30. 2016, we incurred   $11.2 million   of transaction costs related to the planned merger with Danone and other merger and acquisition activities compared to   $9.8 million   of transaction costs related to acquisitions in the prior year.  Offsetting the prior year transaction costs related to acquisitions was a   $7.9 million   gain recognized on the negotiated purchase price settlement of the Earthbound Farm acquisition that occurred after purchase accounting was closed. 
  Interest and other expenses, net     Interest and other expenses, net for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $9.4 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . The   increase   was driven by higher debt levels outstanding during the first nine months primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2015 and continued capital investments.  These   increases   were partially offset by lower mark-to-market   losses   on our interest rate swaps of   $2.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $7.1 million   in the same period of   2015  .  
  Income tax expense     The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   33.2%   compared to   33.1%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a decrease in favorable return to provision adjustments in 2015 related to changes in estimates associated with a credit for qualified research activities and an increase in the U.S. manufacturing deduction.  The increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by  
  
   44 

changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, which were principally driven by an increase in the investment deduction in Belgium and the generally lower foreign tax rates associated with our Vega acquisition. Changes in the relative profitability of our operating segments, as well as changes to federal, state and foreign tax laws may cause the rate to change from historical rates. 
  Loss in equity method investments     Our share of the loss related to the China joint venture was   $6.1 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $8.7 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was due to heavy start-up costs in the first quarter of 2015 compared to same period of 2016. Our share of the loss related to our other equity investment was   $0.8 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Americas Foods   Beverages Segment Results 
  The following table presents certain financial information concerning our Americas Foods   Beverages segment s financial results (note: totals may not sum due to rounding):    

Total net sales     Total net sales   increased     $262.3 million  , or   10.7%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . This   increase   was driven by volume growth, including acquisitions within the last year which contributed   $152.9 million   in net sales year-to-date and 6.3 percentage points of growth, and a favorable mix. These   increases   were partially offset by a $3.5 million unfavorable impact of currency translation driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso. 
  Net sales in the Plant-based Foods and Beverages platform   increased     20.5%  , with the acquisition of Vega and IPP contributing 15.2 percentage points of growth, collectively, and organic growth. Organic growth was primarily driven by increased sales of plant-based yogurts and frozen desserts, coconut beverages and nut-based beverages, including almond and cashew products, which was partially offset by declines in soy beverages of $13.3 million.   
  Net sales growth in the Coffee Creamers and Beverages platform   increased     11.2%  . This performance was primarily driven by organic growth largely from increased volumes, with the acquisition of EIEIO contributing 1.1 percentage point growth. Organic growth was primarily driven by new product introductions, including Stok cold-brewed coffees, along with increases in flavored creamers, plant-based creamers and organic dairy creamers driven by expanded distribution and improved velocities, along with some benefit of pricing taken in the third quarter of 2015. 
  Premium Dairy platform sales growth of   10.4%   was principally driven by the acquisition of Wallaby, which contributed 7.5 percentage points of growth. Excluding Wallaby, growth was largely driven by growth in refrigerated and aseptic milks driven by higher pricing taken in the second quarter of 2015 to offset the rising costs of organic milk, along with growth in organic cheese. 
    
  Fresh Foods platform net sales   decreased     4.9%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily due to lower packaged salad volumes as a result of supply chain constraints and lower distribution, partially offset by higher pricing. The platform continues to focus on supply chain enhancements and customer service improvements to rebuild distribution levels following the SAP implementation-related business disruptions experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  Cost of sales     Cost of sales   increased     $152.9 million  , or   9.4%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . This   increase   was driven by the impact of acquisitions, along with underlying volume increases, partially offset by   $3.1 million   of gains on our commodity hedges compared to   $0.3 million   in the same period of 2015.  Costs were also impacted by   $10.2 million   of costs as a result of the SAP implementation at the Fresh Foods platform. 
  
   45 

Gross profit     Gross profit margin   increased     80   basis points to   34.0%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The   increase   was primarily driven by a favorable product mix, including the impact of acquisitions, and pricing that offset increased commodity costs.  Margin improvement was partially offset by the approximate 40 basis point impact of the SAP implementation related costs. 
  Operating expenses     Operating expenses   increased     $52.9 million  , or   9.7%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. The   increase   was primarily due to incremental expenses attributed to acquisitions and marketing investments, higher selling and distribution costs related to increased volumes, and higher employee-related costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred   $5.5 million   of integration costs related to merger and acquisition activities, including the SAP implementation within the Fresh Foods platform, compared to   $6.8 million   in the same period of 2015. 
    
  Europe Foods   Beverages Segment Results 
  The following table presents certain financial information concerning our Europe Foods   Beverages segment s financial results (note: totals may not sum due to rounding): 

Total net sales     Net sales   increased     $42.1 million  , or   10.6%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The   increase   was driven principally by continued strong volume growth and a favorable mix, led by nut-based, coconut and oat beverages, and strong growth in our plant-based yogurts. Net sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation which reduced growth by 3.8 percentage points.  
  Cost of sales     Cost of sales   increased     $31.9 million  , or   14.3%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   driven by higher sales volumes, unfavorable mix, higher depreciation, and negative currency impacts. In addition, during the first quarter of 2016, we wrote off $2.2 million in fixed assets related to the demolition of the Wevelgem warehouse in connection with European capacity expansion. Currency translation increased cost of sales by $2.2 million. 
  Gross profit     Gross profit margin   decreased   to   42.2%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   44.0%   for the same period in   2015  . The warehouse write off had an unfavorable impact on gross margins of approximately 50 basis points and currency translation contributed an additional unfavorable impact of approximately 150 basis points.  
  Operating expenses     Operating expenses   increased     $7.2 million  , or   5.7%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The   increase   was primarily driven by higher general and administrative expenses as a result of investments in personnel and infrastructure, increased marketing investments, and higher distribution costs from increased volumes that was largely offset by increased internal production and shipping efficiencies. Currency translation increased operating expenses by $3.4 million. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Debt Facilities 
    
  On November 6, 2015, the Company entered into the fourth amendment to its existing senior secured credit facility (the  Fourth Amendment ), which among other things extended the maturity dates of the revolving credit facility and the term loan A-1 credit facility to November 6, 2020 and the term loan A-2 credit facility to November 6, 2022 and increased the term loan on both the A-1 and A-2 credit facilities to $750 million.  In addition, the Fourth Amendment modified the maximum consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio to be set at 4.00 to 1.0 at all times.    

46 

As of October 31, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings of $1.6 billion under our $2.5 billion senior secured credit facilities, which consisted of $1.5 billion of term loan borrowings and $137.9 million borrowed under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility commitment. We further had $9.0 million in outstanding letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility. We had the ability to incur up to a maximum of approximately $825 million of additional indebtedness as governed by the current financial covenants under our senior secured credit facility, assuming such proceeds are not utilized to acquire additional businesses or operations. 
    
  The senior secured credit facilities are secured by security interests and liens on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries. The senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries. As of October 31, 2016, borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum for the $1.0 billion revolving commitment and the $721.9 million currently outstanding on the term loan A-1 facility and LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum for the $744.4 million currently outstanding on the term loan A-2 facility. 
    
  The completion of the Merger of the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Danone will trigger a change of control default under the senior secured credit facilities; however, under the Merger Agreement, Danone has agreed to repay the facility at closing if the change of control default provision is not modified or waived. 
  Alpro maintains a revolving credit facility not to exceed  30.0 million or its currency equivalent. The facility is unsecured and guaranteed by the Company. The Alpro revolving credit facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes of Alpro and for the issuance of up to  30.0 million letters of credit or its currency equivalent. At October 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Alpro did not have any outstanding borrowings. The facility matures on June 29, 2017. 
  Vega maintains an uncommitted revolving credit facility not to exceed $15.0 million CAD. The facility is unsecured and guaranteed by the Company. The facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes of Vega. At October 31, 2016, there were no amounts outstanding in borrowings under the facility.  At December 31, 2015, there was $7.1 million CAD ($5.1 million USD) outstanding in borrowings under the facility.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all related (or associated) covenants under our debt facilities. 
    
  Liquidity 
  Based on current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our cash on hand, together with operating cash flows, and amounts expected to be available under our senior secured credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs over the next twelve months. Our anticipated uses of cash include capital expenditures, working capital needs, other general corporate purposes, and financial obligations such as payments under the senior secured credit facility. In addition, we also evaluate and consider strategic acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, and stock repurchases, as well as other transactions to create stockholder value and enhance financial performance. Such transactions may require cash expenditures by us or generate proceeds for us. In connection with such transactions, or to fund other anticipated uses of cash, we may modify our senior secured credit facilities, seek additional debt financing or issue equity securities. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $47.8 million   of our total cash on hand was attributable to our foreign operations and currently domiciled outside the U.S. We anticipate permanently reinvesting our foreign earnings outside the U.S.  
  Capital Resources 
  Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase up to $150.0 million of its common stock. The primary purpose of the program is to offset dilution from the Company s equity compensation plans, but the Company also may make discretionary purchases. Shares may be repurchased under the program from time to time in one or more open market or other transactions, at the discretion of the Company, subject to market conditions and other factors. The authorization to repurchase shares will end when the Company has repurchased the maximum amount of shares authorized, or the Company s Board of Directors has determined to discontinue such repurchases. To date, no shares have been repurchased under the share repurchase program. 
  Historical Cash Flow 
  The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities (note: totals may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding): 

47 

Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $207.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $169.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The primary drivers of the   increase   in cash from operating activities was an increase in net income after adjustments for items such as depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes offset by a   decrease   in cash provided from operating assets and liabilities.  The decrease in cash provided from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in prepaid expense and other assets driven primarily by an increase in income tax receivable due to timing and advance payments related to agricultural operations; along with lower accounts payable and accruals driven by the timing of cash disbursements related to outstanding payments at the end of 2015 relative to the end of 2014, and higher cash payments of employee bonuses in the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of higher operating results in 2015 compared to 2014 and increases in headcount. These decreases in operating liabilities were partially offset by a lesser increase in accounts receivable related to a more significant increase in sales during the first nine months of 2015 to 2016, and a lower increase in inventory in relation to sales primarily due a specific reduction of inventory related to a co-manufacturer transition in 2016. 
    
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities was $  184.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to net cash used in investing activities of   $895.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily driven by a   $690.2 million     decrease   in payments for acquisitions and a lower level of capital expenditures in 2016.      
    
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities was $  5.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to net cash provided of   $696.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in the amount of cash from financing activities from 2015 was driven primarily by the lower amount of financing related to acquisition activities.  
  Contractual Obligations and Other Long-Term Liabilities 
  There have been no material changes in the information provided in Item 7-Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    Contractual Obligations and Other Long-Term Liabilities  of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations, and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. We have identified the following policies as critical accounting policies: 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Purchase Price Allocation; 
     
   48 

Revenue Recognition, Sales Incentives, and Trade Accounts Receivable; 
                
    Share-Based Compensation; 
                
    Property, Plant, and Equipment; and 
                
    Income Taxes.

  Part II   Other Information 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  On July 12, 2016, plaintiff Kenneth Bottesi, a purported stockholder of WhiteWave, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the District Court for the City and County of Denver, Colorado, against WhiteWave, its directors, Danone, and July Merger Sub  Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Danone ("Merger Sub"), challenging the proposed merger between WhiteWave and Danone (  Bottesi v. The WhiteWave Foods Company, et al.  ). The complaint alleged that the WhiteWave directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed merger, and that WhiteWave, Danone, and Merger Sub aided and abetted the directors  alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. On September 6, 2016, plaintiff Bottesi voluntarily dismissed his claims with prejudice. 
    
  Between August 8 and August 15, four (4) putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, each asserting a claim for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 against WhiteWave and its directors and a claim for violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the WhiteWave Board of Directors (  Malkoff v. Engles, et al., Vanden Berge v. Engles, et al., McDonald v. The WhiteWave Foods Company, et al, and Gilhousen v. Engles, et al.  ). On August 23, 2016, the court ordered the   Malkoff  ,   Vanden Berge  ,   McDonald  , and   Gilhousen   actions be consolidated (the  Consolidated Action ). On September 13, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado dismissed the Consolidated Action, with prejudice. 
    
  On August 23, 2016, a fifth putative class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, asserting a claim for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 against WhiteWave and its directors and a claim for violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the WhiteWave Board of Directors and Danone (  Louie v. The WhiteWave Foods Company et al  .). On September 9, 2016, Plaintiff Edward Louie dismissed the action with prejudice.     
  
   49 

The Company has agreed, after arm s-length negotiations to pay plaintiffs in the   Bottesi   action, Consolidated Action and   Louie   action a combined fee and expense payment of $0.5 million , for having caused the Company to make certain supplemental disclosures to the Definitive Proxy Statement regarding the proposed merger, which supplemental disclosures were included in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 9, 2016. No court has approved, and no court will approve, the fee and expense payment. 
    
  On September 19, 2016, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado challenging the proposed merger between WhiteWave and Danone by City of Dearborn Heights Act 345 Police   Retirement System, a purported stockholder of WhiteWave, against WhiteWave, its directors, Danone, and Merger Sub. The complaint alleges that the directors of WhiteWave breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed merger by, among other things, conducting an allegedly unfair and inadequate sale process, agreeing to an allegedly unfair and inadequate price, agreeing to deal protection devices that allegedly preclude other potential bidders from making competing bids for WhiteWave, allegedly failing to protect against certain purported conflicts of interest, and allegedly failing to disclose all material information to WhiteWave stockholders in connection with the proposed merger, and that Danone and Merger Sub aided and abetted such alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The complaint further asserts a claim for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 against WhiteWave and its directors, and a claim for violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the WhiteWave directors, Danone, and Merger Sub for allegedly disseminating a materially misleading proxy statement in connection with the proposed merger. The complaint seeks, among other things, rescissory damages, and costs, including attorneys  and experts  fees. WhiteWave believes the lawsuit is without merit. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
       
  There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   except as previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
   
  Item 2C. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  On May 23, 2013, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase up to $150.0 million of its common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , no shares of common stock have been repurchased under this program. There is no expiration date for the program, and the authorization to repurchase shares will end when the Company has repurchased the maximum amount of shares authorized, or the Company s Board of Directors has determined to discontinue such repurchases.
