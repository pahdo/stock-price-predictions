   SELECT MEDICAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION AND SELECT MEDICAL CORPORATION   
   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)     
     
   1.                   Basis of Presentation  
     
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Select Medical Holdings Corporation ( Holdings ) and Select Medical Corporation ( Select ) as of September 30, 2016, and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). In the opinion of management, such information contains all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flow for such periods. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. Holdings and Select and their subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the  Company.  The condensed consolidated financial statements of Holdings include the accounts of its wholly owned subsidiary, Select. Holdings conducts substantially all of its business through Select and its subsidiaries.  
     
  Certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted consistent with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), although the Company believes the disclosure is adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016.  
     
   2.                   Accounting Policies  
     
   Use of Estimates   
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  
     
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15 , Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which addresses the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation , which simplifies various aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees. The areas for simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents   
     
   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases . This ASU includes a lessee accounting model that recognizes two types of leases; finance and operating. This ASU requires that a lessee recognize on the balance sheet assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. Lessees will    need to recognize almost all leases on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained the dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will depend on its classification as finance or operating lease. For short-term leases of twelve months or less, lessees are permitted to make an accounting election by class of underlying asset not to recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. If the alternative is elected, lease expense would be recognized generally on the straight-line basis over the respective lease term. 
     
  The amendments in ASU 2016-02 will take effect for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. A modified retrospective approach is required for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements.  The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which changes the presentation of deferred income taxes. The intent is to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes through the requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The revised guidance is effective for annual fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In May 2014, March 2016, and April 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Principal versus Agent Considerations , ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , and ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , respectively, which supersede most of the current revenue recognition requirements. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. New disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers are also required. The original standards were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016; however, in July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of these standards, with a new effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The standards require the selection of a modified retrospective or cumulative effect transition method for retrospective application.  The Company is currently evaluating the standards to determine the impact they will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In April and August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15, each titled  Interest- Imputation of Interest , to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The standard requires debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability. The FASB clarified that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements can be presented as an asset and amortized over the term of the arrangement. The Company adopted the standard at the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was retrospectively conformed to reflect the

Table of Contents   
     
  adoption of the standard and approximately $38.0 million of unamortized debt issuance costs were reclassified to be a direct reduction of debt, rather than a component of other assets.  
     
   3.                   Acquisitions  
     
    Physiotherapy Acquisition    
     
  On March 4, 2016, Select acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Physiotherapy Associates Holdings, Inc. ( Physiotherapy ) for $406.3 million, net of $12.3 million of cash acquired. Select financed the acquisition using a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from an incremental term loan facility under the Select credit facilities, as defined below (see Note 7 for more details). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $3.2 million of Physiotherapy acquisition costs were recognized in general and administrative expense.  
     
  Physiotherapy is a national provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation care offering a wide range of services, including general orthopedics, spinal care and neurological rehabilitation, as well as orthotics and prosthetics services.  
     
  The Physiotherapy acquisition is being accounted for under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805, Business Combinations. The Company has prepared a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The Company is in the process of completing its assessment of fair values for identifiable tangible and intangible assets, and liabilities assumed; therefore, the values set forth below are subject to adjustment during the measurement period for such activities as estimating useful lives of long-lived assets and finite lived intangibles and completing assessment of fair values by obtaining appraisals. The amount of these potential adjustments could be significant. The Company expects to complete its purchase price allocation activities by December 31, 2016.  
     
  The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting (in thousands):  

10   

Table of Contents   
     
  Goodwill of $319.1 million has been recognized in the transaction, representing the excess of the purchase price over the value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The factors considered in determining the goodwill that resulted from the Physiotherapy purchase price included Physiotherapy s future earnings potential and the value of the assembled workforce. The goodwill has been allocated to the outpatient rehabilitation segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. However, prior to its acquisition by the Company, Physiotherapy completed certain acquisitions that resulted in goodwill with an estimated value of $8.8 million that is deductible for tax purposes, which the Company will deduct through 2030.  
     
  Due to the integrated nature of our operations, it is not practicable to separately identify net revenue and earnings of Physiotherapy on a stand-alone basis.  
     
    Concentra Acquisition    
     
  On June 1, 2015, MJ Acquisition Corporation, a joint venture that Select created with Welsh, Carson, Anderson   Stowe XII, L.P., consummated the acquisition of Concentra, Inc. ( Concentra ), the indirect operating subsidiary of Concentra Group Holdings, LLC, and its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, dated as of March 22, 2015, by and among MJ Acquisition Corporation, Concentra and Humana Inc., MJ Acquisition Corporation acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Concentra from Humana, Inc. for $1,047.2 million, net of $3.8 million of cash acquired.  
     
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets, fixed assets, non-controlling interests, and certain pre-acquisition contingencies. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company completed the accounting for certain deferred tax matters.  
     
 11   

Table of Contents   
     
  The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting (in thousands):  

Goodwill of $651.2 million was recognized in the transaction, representing the excess of the purchase price over the value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The factors considered in determining the goodwill that resulted from the Concentra purchase price included Concentra s future earnings potential and the value of Concentra s assembled workforce. The goodwill is allocated to the Concentra segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. However, prior to its acquisition by MJ Acquisition Corporation, Concentra completed certain acquisitions that resulted in goodwill with an estimated value of $23.9 million that is deductible for tax purposes, which the Company will deduct through 2025.  
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, Concentra contributed net revenue of $258.5 million and net income of approximately $0.9 million, which are reflected in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Concentra contributed net revenue of $764.3 million and net income of approximately $7.9 million, which are reflected in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.  
     
    Pro Forma Results    
     
  The following pro forma unaudited results of operations have been prepared assuming the acquisitions of Concentra and Physiotherapy occurred January 1, 2014 and 2015, respectively. These results are not necessarily indicative of results of future operations nor of the results that would have actually occurred had the acquisitions been consummated on the aforementioned dates. The Company s results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 include both Concentra and Physiotherapy for the entire period and there are no pro forma adjustments; therefore, no pro forma information is presented for the period.

Table of Contents   
     
  The pro forma financial information is based on the preliminary allocation of the purchase price of the Physiotherapy acquisition, and is therefore subject to adjustment upon finalizing the purchase price allocation, as described above, during the measurement period. The net income tax impact was calculated at a statutory rate, as if Concentra and Physiotherapy had been subsidiaries of the Company as of January 1, 2014 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  Pro forma results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were adjusted to include $3.2 million of Physiotherapy acquisition costs and exclude $4.7 million of Concentra acquisition costs. Pro forma results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were adjusted to exclude approximately $3.2 million of Physiotherapy acquisition costs.  
     
    Other Acquisitions    
     
  In addition to the acquisition of Physiotherapy, the Company completed other acquisitions consisting of hospital, clinic, and center businesses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The specialty hospital transactions were conducted principally through either the exchange of nonmonetary assets or issuance of equity interests.  Assets transferred and equity interests issued for these acquisitions consisted of $7.6 million in cash payments, net of cash received, $17.7 million for specialty hospitals exchanged, and issuance of $38.3 million of equity interests.  The specialty hospital exchange transaction resulted in a non-operating gain totaling $6.5 million due, in part, to a bargain purchase because the fair values of the identifiable assets received in the exchange transaction exceeded the fair values of the transferred hospitals. The assets received in these acquisitions consisted principally of cash, real property, and goodwill, of which $46.2 million, $0.9 million, and $4.1 million of goodwill was recognized in our specialty hospital, outpatient rehabilitation, and Concentra reporting units, respectively.  
     
   4.                   Sale of Businesses  
     
  The Company recognized non-operating gains totaling $42.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, principally as the result of the sale of its contract therapy businesses for $65.0 million, resulting in a non-operating gain of $33.9 million. Additionally, the Company sold nine outpatient rehabilitation clinics to an entity in which the Company holds a non-controlling interest, resulting in a non-operating gain of $1.7 million.  
     
   5.                   Equity Investment   Events  
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an entity in which the Company owned a non-controlling interest was sold, which resulted in a non-operating loss of $5.1 million.

  The net carrying value of the Company s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets consist of the following:

Amortization expense was $4.1 million and $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amortization expense was $12.2 million and $4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Estimated amortization expense of the Company s customer relationships and non-compete agreements for each of the five succeeding years is $16.3 million. 
     
  In addition, the Company has recognized unfavorable leasehold interests which are recorded as liabilities. The net carrying value of unfavorable leasehold interests was $4.0 million and $3.0 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
     
  The Company s favorable leasehold assets and unfavorable leasehold liabilities are amortized to rent expense over the remaining term of their respective leases to reflect a market rent per period based upon the market conditions present at the acquisition date. The net effect of this amortization increased rent expense by $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  The Company s accreditations and trademarks have renewal terms. The costs to renew these intangibles are expensed as incurred. At September 30, 2016, the accreditations and trademarks have a weighted average time until next renewal of 1.5 years and 3.1 years, respectively.

   7. Indebtedness   
     
  For purposes of this indebtedness footnote, references to Select exclude Concentra, because the Concentra credit facilities are non-recourse to Holdings and Select.  
     
  The components of long-term debt and notes payable are shown in the following tables:  

(1)                                    Includes unamortized premium of $1.2 million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. Includes unamortized debt issuance costs of $10.4 million and $8.9 million at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively.

Includes unamortized debt issuance costs of $7.4 million and $14.8 million at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. 
     
  (3)                                    Includes unamortized discounts of $2.9 million at both December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016. Includes unamortized debt issuance costs of $20.2 million and $13.7 million at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. 
     
   Maturities of Long-Term Debt and Notes Payable   
     
  Maturities of the Company s long-term debt for the period from October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the years after 2016 are approximately as follows:  

Excess Cash Flow Payment   
     
  On March 2, 2016, Select made a principal prepayment of $10.2 million associated with its term loans (the  Select term loans ) in accordance with the provision in the Select credit facilities that requires mandatory prepayments of term loans as a result of annual excess cash flow as defined in the Select credit facilities.  
     
   Select Credit Facilities   
     
  On March 4, 2016, Select entered into an Additional Credit Extension Amendment (the  Additional Credit Extension Amendment ) to Select s senior secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent and lender, and the additional lenders named therein (the  Select credit facilities ). The Additional Credit Extension Amendment (i) provided for the lenders named therein to make available an aggregate of $625.0 million of Series F Tranche B Term Loans, (ii) extended the financial covenants through March 3, 2021, (iii) added a 1.00% prepayment premium for prepayments made with new term loans on or prior to March 4, 2017 if such new term loans have a lower yield than the Series F Tranche B Term Loans, and (iv) made certain other technical amendments to the Select credit facilities. The Series F Tranche B Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Select credit facilities, subject to an Adjusted LIBO Rate floor of 1.00%) plus 5.00% for Eurodollar Loans or the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Select credit facilities) plus 4.00% for Alternate Base Rate Loans (as defined in the Select credit facilities). Select is required to make principal payments on the Series F Tranche B Term Loans in quarterly installments on the last day of each of March, June, September and December, beginning June 30, 2016, in amounts equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Series F Tranche B Term Loans outstanding as of the date of the Additional Credit Extension Amendment. The balance of the   
     
 16   

Table of Contents   
     
  Series F Tranche B Term Loans is payable on March 3, 2021. Except as specifically set forth in the Additional Credit Extension Amendment, the terms and conditions of the Series F Tranche B Term Loans are identical to the terms of the outstanding Series E Term B Loans under the Select credit facilities and the other loan documents to which Select is party.  
     
  Select used the proceeds of the Series F Tranche B Term Loans to (i) refinance in full the Series D Tranche B Term Loans due December 20, 2016, (ii) consummate the acquisition of Physiotherapy, and (iii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Physiotherapy, the refinancing, and the Additional Credit Extension Amendment.  
     
  As a result of the Additional Credit Extension Amendment relating to the Series F Tranche B Term Loans, the interest rate payable on the Series E Tranche B Term Loans was increased from Adjusted LIBO plus 4.00% (subject to an Adjusted LIBO rate floor of 1.00%), or Alternative Base Rate plus 3.00%, to Adjusted LIBO plus 5.00% (subject to an Adjusted LIBO rate floor of 1.00%), or Alternative Base Rate plus 4.00%.  
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a loss on early retirement of debt of $0.8 million relating to the repayment of the Series D Tranche B Term Loans under the Select credit facilities.  
     
   Concentra Credit Facilities   
     
  On September 26, 2016, Concentra entered into Amendment No. 1 (the  Concentra Credit Agreement Amendment ) to its first lien credit agreement (the  Concentra first lien credit agreement ) dated June 1, 2015. The Concentra first lien credit agreement initially provided for $500.0 million in first lien credit facilities composed of $450.0 million, seven-year term loans ( Concentra first lien term loan ) and a $50.0 million, five-year revolving credit facility ( Concentra revolving facility ).  
     
  The Concentra Credit Agreement Amendment provided an additional $200.0 million of first lien term loans due June 1, 2022, the proceeds of which were used to prepay in full Concentra s second lien term loan due June 1, 2023; and also amended certain restrictive covenants to give Concentra greater operational flexibility.  
     
  The Concentra first lien term loan continues to bear interest at a rate equal to Adjusted LIBO (as defined in the Concentra first lien credit agreement) plus 3.00% (subject to an Adjusted LIBO floor of 1.00%), or Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Concentra first lien credit agreement) plus 2.00% (subject to an Alternate Base Rate floor of 2.00%). The Concentra first lien term loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments of $1.6 million through March 31, 2022, with the remaining unamortized aggregate principal due on the maturity date.  
     
  The reacquisition price of the second lien term loans was $202.0 million. The premium plus the expensing of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issuance discount resulted in a loss on early retirement of debt of $10.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

   8. Fair Value   
     
  Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, notes payable, and long-term debt. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.  

(1)                                    The carrying value includes unamortized premium of $1.2 million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively, and unamortized debt issuance costs of $10.4 million and $8.9 million at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. 
     
  (2)                                    The carrying value includes unamortized discounts of $2.8 million and $12.9 million at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively, and unamortized debt issuance costs of $7.4 million and $14.8 million at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. 
     
  (3)                                    The carrying value includes unamortized discounts of $2.9 million at both December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 and unamortized debt issuance costs of $20.2 million and $13.7 million at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. 
     
  The fair value of the Select credit facilities and the Concentra credit facilities was based on quoted market prices for this debt in the syndicated loan market. The fair value of Select s 6.375% senior notes debt was based on quoted market prices.  
     
  The Company considers the inputs in the valuation process to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy is defined as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, which includes quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.  
     
   9.    Segment Information  
     
  The Company s reportable segments consist of: (i) specialty hospitals, (ii) outpatient rehabilitation, and (iii) Concentra. Other activities include the Company s corporate shared services and certain other non-consolidating joint ventures and minority investments in other healthcare related businesses. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates performance of the segments based on Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain (loss) on early retirement of debt, stock compensation expense, Concentra acquisition costs, Physiotherapy acquisition costs, non-operating gain (loss), and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries.

   10. Income per Common Share   
     
  Holdings applies the two-class method for calculating and presenting income per common share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of stock participation rights in undistributed earnings. The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the calculation of income per common share in Holdings  consolidated statements of operations and the differences between basic weighted average shares outstanding and diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to compute basic and diluted income per common share, respectively:

11. Commitments and Contingencies   
     
   Litigation   
     
  The Company is a party to various legal actions, proceedings and claims (some of which are not insured), and regulatory and other governmental audits and investigations in the ordinary course of its business. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, proceedings and regulatory and other governmental audits and investigations. These matters could potentially subject the Company to sanctions, damages, recoupments, fines and other penalties. The Department of Justice, Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services ( CMS ) or other federal and state enforcement and regulatory agencies may conduct additional investigations related to the Company s businesses in the future that may, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.  
     
  To address claims arising out of the Company s operations, the Company maintains professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance, subject to self-insured retention of $2.0 million per medical incident for professional liability claims and $2.0 million per occurrence for general liability claims. The Company also maintains umbrella liability insurance covering claims which, due to their nature or amount, are not covered by or not fully covered by the Company s other insurance policies. These insurance policies also do not generally cover punitive damages and are subject to various deductibles and policy limits. Significant legal actions, as well as the cost and possible lack of available insurance, could subject the Company to substantial uninsured liabilities. In the Company s opinion, the outcome of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

  Healthcare providers are subject to lawsuits under the qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act. Qui tam lawsuits typically remain under seal (hence, usually unknown to the defendant) for some time while the government decides whether or not to intervene on behalf of a private qui tam plaintiff (known as a relator) and take the lead in the litigation. These lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and penalties and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring the suits. The Company is and has been a defendant in these cases in the past, and may be named as a defendant in similar cases from time to time in the future.  
     
   Evansville Litigation  . On October 19, 2015, the plaintiff-relators filed a Second Amended Complaint in United States of America, ex rel. Tracy Conroy, Pamela Schenk and Lisa Wilson v. Select Medical Corporation, Select Specialty Hospital Evansville, LLC (  SSH-Evansville  ), Select Employment Services, Inc., and Dr. Richard Sloan. The case is a civil action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana by private plaintiff-relators on behalf of the United States under the federal False Claims Act. The plaintiff-relators are the former CEO and two former case managers at SSH-Evansville, and the defendants currently include the Company, SSH-Evansville, a subsidiary of the Company serving as common paymaster for its employees, and a physician who practices at SSH-Evansville. The plaintiff-relators allege that, from 2006 until April 2012, SSH-Evansville discharged patients too early or held patients too long, improperly discharged patients to and readmitted them from short stay hospitals, up-coded diagnoses at admission, and admitted patients for whom long-term acute care was not medically necessary. They also allege that the defendants engaged in retaliation in violation of federal and state law. The Second Amended Complaint replaces a prior complaint that was filed under seal on September 28, 2012 and served on the Company on February 15, 2013, after a federal magistrate judge unsealed it on January 8, 2013. All deadlines in the case had been stayed after the seal was lifted in order to allow the government time to complete its investigation and to decide whether or not to intervene. On June 19, 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice notified the District Court of its decision not to intervene in the case, and the District Court thereafter approved a case management plan imposing certain deadlines. 
     
  In December 2015, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on multiple grounds. One basis for the Motion to Dismiss was the False Claims Act s public disclosure bar, which disqualifies qui tam actions that are based on fraud already publicly disclosed through enumerated sources, unless the relator is an original source. The Affordable Care Act, enacted on March 23, 2010, altered the public disclosure bar language of the False Claims Act by, among other things, giving the United States the right to oppose dismissal of a case based on the public disclosure bar. In their Motion to Dismiss, the defendants contended that the public disclosure bar applies because substantially the same conduct as the plaintiff-relators have alleged had previously been publicly disclosed, including in a New York Times article and a prior qui tam case.  A second basis for the defendants  Motion to Dismiss was that the plaintiff-relators did not plead their claims with sufficient particularity, as required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  
     
  Then, based on the Affordable Care Act s changes to the public disclosure bar language of the False Claims Act, the United States filed a notice asserting a veto of the defendants  use of the public disclosure bar for claims arising from conduct from and after March 23, 2010. The defendants filed briefs challenging the United States  contention that the statutory changes gives it an unfettered right to veto the applicability of the public disclosure bar. On September 30, 2016, the District Court partially granted and partially denied the defendants  Motion to Dismiss. It ruled that the plaintiff-relators alleged substantially the same conduct as had been publicly disclosed and that the plaintiff relators are not original sources, so that the public disclosure bar requires dismissal of all non-retaliation claims arising from conduct before March 23, 2010.  The District Court also ruled that the statutory changes to the public disclosure bar gave the United States the power to veto its applicability to claims arising from conduct on and after March 23, 2010, and therefore did not dismiss those claims based on the public disclosure bar. However, the District Court ruled that the plaintiff-relators did not  
     
 23   

Table of Contents   
     
  plead certain of their claims relating to interrupted stay manipulation and premature discharging of patients with the requisite particularity, and dismissed those claims. The District Court declined to dismiss the plaintiff-relators  claims arising from conduct from and after March 23, 2010 relating to delayed discharging of patients and upcoding and the plaintiff-relators  retaliation claims.  
     
  On October 17, 2016, the defendants filed a Motion seeking certification to file an interlocutory appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit of the District Court s ruling that the United States  has the power to veto the application of the public disclosure bar to the defendants  conduct from and after March 23, 2010. The Company intends to vigorously defend this action, but at this time the Company is unable to predict the timing and outcome of this matter.  
     
   Knoxville Litigation  . On July 13, 2015, the federal District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee unsealed a qui tam Complaint in Armes v. Garman, et al, No. 3:14-cv-00172-TAV-CCS, which named as defendants Select, Select Specialty Hospital Knoxville, Inc. (  SSH-Knoxville  ), Select Specialty Hospital North Knoxville, Inc. and ten current or former employees of these facilities. The Complaint was unsealed after the United States and the State of Tennessee notified the court on July 13, 2015 that each had decided not to intervene in the case. The Complaint is a civil action that was filed under seal on April 29, 2014 by a respiratory therapist formerly employed at SSH-Knoxville. The Complaint alleges violations of the federal False Claims Act and the Tennessee Medicaid False Claims Act based on extending patient stays to increase reimbursement and to increase average length of stay; artificially prolonging the lives of patients to increase Medicare reimbursements and decrease inspections; admitting patients who do not require medically necessary care; performing unnecessary procedures and services; and delaying performance of procedures to increase billing. The Complaint was served on some of the defendants during October 2015. 
     
  In November 2015, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint on multiple grounds. The defendants first argued that False Claims Act s first-to-file bar required dismissal of plaintiff-relator s claims. Under the first-to-file bar, if a qui tam case is pending, no person may bring a related action based on the facts underlying the first action.  The defendants asserted that the plaintiff-relator s claims were based on the same underlying facts as were asserted in the Evansville litigation, discussed above. The defendants also argued that the plaintiff-relator s claims must be dismissed under the public disclosure bar, and because the plaintiff-relator did not plead his claims with sufficient particularity.  
     
  In June 2016, the District Court granted the defendants  Motion to Dismiss and dismissed the plaintiff-relator s lawsuit in its entirety. The District Court ruled that the first-to-file bar precludes all but one of the plaintiff-relator s claims, and that the remaining claim must also be dismissed because the plaintiff-relator failed to plead it with sufficient particularity. In July 2016, the plaintiff-relator filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Then, on October 11, 2016, the plaintiff-relator filed a Motion to Remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings, arguing that the September 30, 2016 decision in the Evansville litigation, discussed above, undermines the basis for the District Court s dismissal. The Company intends to vigorously defend this action, but at this time the Company is unable to predict the timing and outcome of this matter.  
     
   Construction Commitments   
     
  At September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding commitments under construction contracts related to new construction, improvements and renovations at the Company s long term acute care properties, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and Concentra centers totaling approximately $16.2 million.

   12. Financial Information for Subsidiary Guarantors and Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries under Select s 6.375% Senior Notes   
     
  Select s 6.375% senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, except for customary limitations, on a senior basis by all of Select s wholly owned subsidiaries (the   Subsidiary Guarantors  ) which is defined as a subsidiary where Select or a subsidiary of Select holds all of the outstanding ownership interests. Certain of Select s subsidiaries did not guarantee the 6.375% senior notes (the   Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries,   including Group Holdings and its subsidiaries, which were designated as Non-Guarantor subsidiaries by Select s board of directors at the closing of the Concentra acquisition, the   Non-Guarantor Concentra  ).  
     
  Select conducts a significant portion of its business through its subsidiaries. Presented below is condensed consolidating financial information for Select, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, and Non-Guarantor Concentra at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016.  
     
  The equity method has been used by Select with respect to investments in subsidiaries. The equity method has been used by Subsidiary Guarantors with respect to investments in Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Separate financial statements for Subsidiary Guarantors are not presented.  
     
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior reported amounts in order to conform to the current year guarantor structure.

   Forward-Looking Statements   
     
  This report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words  may,   could,   would,   should,   believe,   expect,   anticipate,   plan,   target,   estimate,   project,   intend  and similar expressions. These statements include, among others, statements regarding our expected business outlook, anticipated financial and operating results, our business strategy and means to implement our strategy, our objectives, the amount and timing of capital expenditures, the likelihood of our success in expanding our business, financing plans, budgets, working capital needs and sources of liquidity.  
     
  Forward-looking statements are only predictions and are not guarantees of performance. These statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding our services, the expansion of our services, competitive conditions and general economic conditions. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Forward-looking statements also involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following:  
     
                        changes in government reimbursement for our services due to the implementation of healthcare reform legislation, deficit reduction measures, and/or new payment policies (including, for example, the expiration of the moratorium limiting the full application of the 25 Percent Rule that would reduce our Medicare payments for those patients admitted to a long term acute care hospital from a referring hospital in excess of an applicable percentage admissions threshold) may result in a reduction in net operating revenues, an increase in costs and a reduction in profitability; 
     
                        the impact of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 ( BBA of 2013 ), which establishes new payment limits for Medicare patients who do not meet specified criteria, may result in a reduction in net operating revenues and profitability of our long term acute care hospitals ( LTCHs  
     
                        the failure of our specialty hospitals to maintain their Medicare certifications may cause our net operating revenues and profitability to decline; 
     
                        the failure of our facilities operated as  hospitals within hospitals  to qualify as hospitals separate from their host hospitals may cause our net operating revenues and profitability to decline; 
     
                        a government investigation or assertion that we have violated applicable regulations may result in sanctions or reputational harm and increased costs; 
     
                        acquisitions or joint ventures may prove difficult or unsuccessful, use significant resources or expose us to unforeseen liabilities;

   Overview   
     
  We began operations in 1997, and we believe that we are one of the largest operators of specialty hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation clinics in the United States based on number of facilities.  On March 4, 2016, we acquired Physiotherapy, a national provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation care, which operated 574 clinics nationwide. As of September 30, 2016, we operated 123 specialty hospitals in 27 states and 1,603 outpatient rehabilitation clinics in 37 states and the District of Columbia. Concentra, which is operated through a joint venture subsidiary, provides occupational medicine, consumer health, physical therapy, and veteran s healthcare services throughout the United States. As of September 30, 2016, Concentra operated 301 medical centers in 38 states. Concentra also provides contract services at employer worksites and operates Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinics (  CBOCs ). On March 31, 2016, we sold our contract therapy businesses. As of September 30, 2016, we had operations in 46 states and the District of Columbia.  
     
  We manage our Company through three business segments: specialty hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation, and the Concentra segment. We had net operating revenues of $3,239.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Of this total, we earned approximately 53% of our net operating revenues from our specialty hospitals segment, approximately 23% from our outpatient rehabilitation segment, and approximately 24% from our Concentra segment. Our specialty hospitals segment consists of hospitals designed to serve the needs of long term acute care patients and hospitals designed to serve patients that require intensive medical rehabilitation care. Patients are typically admitted to our specialty hospitals from general acute care hospitals. These patients have specialized needs, and serious and often complex medical conditions such as respiratory failure, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, strokes, non-healing wounds, cardiac disorders, renal disorders, and cancer. Our outpatient rehabilitation segment consists of clinics that provide physical, occupational, and speech rehabilitation services. Our outpatient rehabilitation patients are typically diagnosed with musculoskeletal impairments that restrict their ability to perform normal activities of daily living. Our Concentra segment consists of medical centers and contract services provided at employer worksites and Department of Veterans Affairs CBOCs that deliver occupational medicine, consumer health, physical therapy, and veteran s healthcare services.  
     
   Non-GAAP Measure   
     
  We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA income (loss) ( Adjusted EBITDA ) is important to investors because Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator of performance by investors within the healthcare industry. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate financial performance and determine resource allocation for each of our operating units. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, income from operations, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.  
     
  We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain (loss) on early retirement of debt, stock compensation expense, Concentra acquisition costs, Physiotherapy acquisition costs, non-operating gain (loss), and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. We will refer to Adjusted EBITDA throughout the remainder of  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  You should refer to the following table which

Summary Financial Results   
     
    Consolidated Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016    
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net operating revenues increased 3.2% to $1,053.8 million, compared to $1,021.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We had income from operations of $56.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $48.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net income was $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which includes a pre-tax non-operating loss of $1.0 million and a pre-tax loss on early retirement of debt of $10.9 million.  Net income was $32.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, which includes a pre-tax non-operating gain of $29.6 million. Our Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased 16.1% to $98.1 million, compared to $84.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and our Adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 8.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
    Consolidated Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016    
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our net operating revenues increased 19.8% to $3,239.8 million, compared to $2,703.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  We had income from operations of $244.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $212.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Net income was $104.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which includes a pre-tax non-operating gain of $37.1 million and a pre-tax loss on early retirement of debt of $11.6 million. Net income was $110.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which includes a pre-tax non-operating gain of $29.6 million. Our Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 23.4% to $368.1 million, compared to $298.3 million for the nine months ended

  September 30, 2015, and our Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 11.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
    Medicare Reimbursement of LTCH Services   Patient Criteria    
     
  As discussed below under   Regulatory Changes   Medicare Reimbursement of LTCH Services   Patient Criteria ,  new Medicare regulations, which establish new payment limits for Medicare patients discharged from an LTCH who do not meet specified patient criteria, began to be phased in to our LTCHs in the fourth quarter of 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, all of our LTCHs are now operating under the new payment rules.  
     
    New Specialty Hospitals    
     
  Select s development of new specialty hospitals can result in start-up costs exceeding net operating revenues, if any, causing Adjusted EBITDA losses during the start-up period. Adjusted EBITDA losses for start-up hospitals were $9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Adjusted EBITDA losses for start-up hospitals were $19.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $11.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
     
   Significant Events   
     
    Physiotherapy Acquisition    
     
  On March 4, 2016, Select consummated the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Physiotherapy. Select financed the acquisition using a combination of cash on hand and a portion of the proceeds from the Series F Tranche B Term Loans under the Select credit facilities, as discussed below. Acquisition costs of $3.2 million were recognized as part of general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations.  
     
    Sale of Businesses    
     
  The Company recognized a non-operating gain of $42.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company sold its contract therapy businesses for $65.0 million, resulting in a non-operating gain of $33.9 million. The Company also transferred five specialty hospitals in an exchange transaction and sold nine outpatient rehabilitation clinics, to a non-consolidating subsidiary, which resulted in non-operating gains of $6.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively.  
     
    Indebtedness    
     
  On September 26, 2016, Concentra entered into the Concentra Credit Agreement Amendment to the Concentra first lien credit agreement. The amended agreement provided an additional $200.0 million of first lien term loans due June 1, 2022, the net proceeds of which, together with cash on hand, were used to prepay in full Concentra s second lien term loan due June 1, 2023. The reacquisition price of the second lien term loans was $202.0 million, and the prepayment resulted in a loss on early retirement of debt of $10.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  On March 4, 2016, Select entered into an additional credit extension amendment to the Select credit facilities, which among other changes, provided for the lenders named therein to make available an aggregate of $625.0 million of Series F Tranche B Term Loans. Select used the proceeds of the Series F Tranche B Term

  Loans and cash on hand to (i) refinance in full the Series D Tranche B Term Loans due December 20, 2016, (ii) consummate the acquisition of Physiotherapy, and (iii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a loss on early retirement of debt of $0.8 million.  
     
   Regulatory Changes   
     
  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016, contains a detailed discussion of the regulations that affect our business in Part I   Business   Government Regulations. The following is a discussion of recent regulatory changes that have affected our results of operations in 2015 and 2016 or may have an effect on our future results of operations. The information below should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion of regulations contained in our Form 10-K.  
     
    Medicare Reimbursement    
     
  The Medicare program reimburses healthcare providers for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, which are generally persons age 65 and older, those who are chronically disabled, and those suffering from end stage renal disease. The program is governed by the Social Security Act of 1965 and is administered primarily by the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS. Net operating revenues generated directly from the Medicare program represented approximately 30% of our consolidated net operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 37% of our consolidated net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. The principal causes of the decrease in Medicare net operating revenues as a percentage of our total net operating revenues are the acquisitions of Concentra on June 1, 2015, and Physiotherapy on March 4, 2016, which both have a significantly lower relative percentage of Medicare net operating revenues as compared to our historical business prior to the acquisitions.  Since the percentage of net operating revenues generated directly from the Medicare program have been historically higher in our specialty hospitals segment as compared to our outpatient rehabilitation and Concentra segments, we anticipate that the percentage of net operating revenues generated directly from the Medicare program will continue to decrease to the extent growth in our outpatient rehabilitation and Concentra segments outpaces growth in our specialty hospitals segment.  
     
  The Medicare program reimburses our LTCHs, inpatient rehabilitation facilities ( IRFs ) and outpatient rehabilitation providers, using different payment methodologies.  
     
  The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015, reforms Medicare payment policy for services paid under the Medicare physician fee schedule, including our outpatient rehabilitation services. The law repeals the sustainable growth rate (the   SGR  ) formula effective January 1, 2015, and establishes a new payment framework consisting of specified updates to the Medicare physician fee schedule, a new Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (  MIPS  ), and incentives for participation in alternative payment models (  APMs  ). To finance these provisions, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 reduces market basket updates for post-acute care providers, including LTCHs and IRFs, among other Medicare payment cuts. As noted below, the law sets the annual prospective payment system update for fiscal year 2018 at 1% for LTCHs and IRFs, as well as skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, and hospices. The law also extends the exceptions process for outpatient therapy caps through December 31, 2017.

    Medicare Reimbursement of LTCH Services    
     
  There have been significant regulatory changes affecting LTCHs that have affected our net operating revenues and, in some cases, caused us to change our operating models and strategies. We have been subject to regulatory changes that occur through the rulemaking procedures of CMS. All Medicare payments to our LTCHs are made in accordance with long-term care hospital prospective payment system ( LTCH-PPS ). Proposed rules specifically related to LTCHs are generally published in April or May, finalized in August and effective on October 1st of each year.  
     
  The following is a summary of significant changes to the Medicare prospective payment system for LTCHs which have affected our results of operations, as well as proposed policy and payment rate changes that may affect our future results of operations.  
     
   Fiscal Year 2015.    On August 22, 2014, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2015 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015). The standard federal rate was set at $41,044, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2014 of $40,607. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2015 included a market basket increase of 2.9%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.5%, less a reduction of 0.2% mandated by the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ), and less a budget neutrality adjustment of 1.266%. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases was set at $14,972, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2014 fiscal year of $13,314. 
     
   Fiscal Year 2016.    On August 17, 2015, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2016 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016). The standard federal rate was set at $41,763, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2015 of $41,044. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2016 includes a market basket increase of 2.4%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.5%, and less a reduction of 0.2% mandated by the ACA. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS was set at $16,423, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2015 fiscal year of $14,972. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site-neutral payment rate described below was set at $22,538. 
     
   Fiscal Year 2017.   On August 22, 2016, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2017 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017). The standard federal rate was set at $42,476, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2016 of $41,763. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2017 includes a market basket increase of 2.8%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.3%, and less a reduction of 0.75% mandated by the ACA. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS was set at $21,943, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2016 fiscal year of $16,423. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site-neutral payment rate was set at $23,570, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2016 fiscal year of $22,538. 
     
   Medicare Market Basket Adjustments   
     
  The ACA instituted a market basket payment adjustment to LTCHs. In fiscal years 2017 through 2019, the market basket update will be reduced by 0.75%. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 sets the annual update for fiscal year 2018 at 1% after taking into account the market basket payment reduction of 0.75% mandated by the ACA. The ACA specifically allows these market basket reductions to result in less than a 0% payment update and payment rates that are less than the prior year. For fiscal year 2017, CMS is rebasing the LTCH-specific market basket by replacing the 2009-based LTCH-specific market basket  
     
 40   

Table of Contents   
     
  with a 2013-based LTCH-specific market basket that is based on Medicare cost report data from cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2012 and before October 1, 2013.  
     
   Patient Criteria   
     
  The BBA of 2013, enacted December 26, 2013, establishes new payment limits for Medicare patients discharged from an LTCH who do not meet specified criteria. Specifically, for Medicare patients discharged in cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015, LTCHs will be reimbursed under LTCH-PPS only if, immediately preceding the patient s LTCH admission, the patient was discharged from a general acute care hospital paid under IPPS and the patient s stay included at least three days in an intensive care unit (ICU) or coronary care unit (CCU) or the patient is assigned to a Medicare severity diagnosis-related group for LTCHs ( MS-LTC-DRG ) for cases receiving at least 96 hours of ventilator services in the LTCH. In addition, to be paid under LTCH-PPS the patient s discharge from the LTCH may not include a principal diagnosis relating to psychiatric or rehabilitation services. For any Medicare patient who does not meet the new criteria, the LTCH will be paid a lower  site-neutral  payment rate, which will be the lower of (1) the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ) comparable per-diem payment rate capped at the Medicare severity diagnosis-related group ( MS-DRG ) including any outlier payments, or (2) 100 percent of the estimated costs for services.  
     
  The BBA of 2013 provides for a transition to the site-neutral payment rate for those patients not paid under LTCH-PPS. During the transition period (cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2017), a blended rate will be paid for Medicare patients not meeting the new criteria. The blended rate will comprise half the site-neutral payment rate and half the LTCH-PPS payment rate. For discharges in cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2017, only the site-neutral payment rate will apply for Medicare patients not meeting the new criteria.  
     
  In addition, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019, qualifying discharges from an LTCH will continue to be paid at the LTCH-PPS payment rate, unless the number of discharges for which payment is made under the site-neutral payment rate is greater than 50% of the total number of discharges from the LTCH. If the number of discharges for which payment is made under the site-neutral payment rate is greater than 50%, then beginning in the next cost reporting period all discharges from the LTCH will be reimbursed at the site-neutral payment rate. The BBA of 2013 requires CMS to establish a process for an LTCH subject to the site-neutral payment rate to re-qualify for payment under LTCH-PPS.  
     
  Payment adjustments, including the interrupted stay policy and the 25 Percent Rule (discussed below), apply to LTCH discharges regardless of whether the case is paid at the LTCH-PPS payment rate or the site-neutral payment rate. However, short stay outlier payment adjustments do not apply to cases paid at the site-neutral payment rate after the transition period. Beginning in fiscal year 2016, CMS calculates the annual recalibration of the MS-LTC-DRG relative payment weighting factors using only data from LTCH discharges that meet the criteria for exclusion from the site-neutral payment rate. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2016, CMS applies the IPPS fixed-loss amount to site-neutral cases, rather than the LTCH PPS fixed-loss amount. CMS calculates the LTCH-PPS fixed-loss amount using only data from cases paid at the LTCH-PPS payment rate, excluding cases paid at the site-neutral rate.  
     
  Each of our LTCHs has their own unique annual cost reporting period. As a result, the new payment limits became effective for each LTCH at different points in time over the twelve month period that began on October 1, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, all of our LTCHs were operating under the new payment rules.

   25 Percent Rule   
     
  The  25 Percent Rule  is a downward payment adjustment that applies if the percentage of Medicare patients discharged from LTCHs who were admitted from a referring hospital (regardless of whether the LTCH or LTCH satellite is co-located with the referring hospital) exceeds the applicable percentage admissions threshold during a particular cost reporting period. As more fully described under   Business Government Regulations ,  various legislation has limited or deferred the full application of the 25 Percent Rule.  Each of our LTCHs has their own unique annual cost reporting period. As a result, the new payment limits will become effective for each of our LTCHs at different periods of time, commencing on or after July 1, 2016. In the third quarter 2016, 6 of our LTCHs became subject to the new payment limits. During the fourth quarter of 2016, and the first, second, and third quarters of 2017, 14, 36, 16, and 31 of our LTCHs will become subject to the new payment limits, respectively. The effect on our net operating revenues for the third quarter of 2016 was immaterial.  We expect the effect on our net operating revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 to be immaterial.  We currently project that our net operating revenue for 2017 may be adversely affected by approximately $12.0 million if we are unable to mitigate the effects of the new payment limits. 
     
  For discharges that occurred prior to October 1, 2016, the 25 Percent Rule payment adjustments are found in two Medicare regulations, one that applies to Medicare patients admitted from a co-located referring hospital and one that applies to Medicare patients admitted from a referring hospital not co-located with the LTCH.  After October 1, 2016, a single consolidated 25 Percent Rule applies to all LTCH discharges that occur in the LTCH s cost reporting period that begins after the statutory moratoria on the full implementation of the 25 Percent Rule expires. The moratorium on the full application of the 25 Percent Rule applicable to co-located hospitals expired beginning with LTCH cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2016, while the moratorium on the full application of the 25 Percent Rule applicable to LTCHs not co-located with a referring hospital expired beginning with LTCH cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2016. Consequently, LTCHs that are subject to both Medicare regulations will continue to be subject to the moratorium on the full application of the 25 Percent Rule applicable to co-located hospitals until their cost reports beginning on or after October 1, 2016.  
     
  Under the single consolidated 25 Percent Rule, CMS calculates the percentage of LTCH discharges referred from any hospital on a provider number basis only. An LTCH s percentage of Medicare discharges from all locations of a given referring hospital would be determined during settlement of a cost report by dividing the LTCH s total number of Medicare discharges in the cost reporting period (based on the CMS Certification Number (CCN) on the claims) that were admitted directly from a given referring hospital (again determined by the CCN on the referring hospital s claims) by the LTCH s total number of Medicare discharges in the cost reporting period.  LTCH discharges that reach high cost outlier status at the referring hospital are not subject to the 25 Percent Rule payment adjustment (that is, such discharges would only be included in an LTCH s total Medicare discharges and would not count as having been admitted from that referring hospital), and to the extent the LTCH is exclusively located in an MSA-dominant area or rural area, the LTCH would have an increased applicable threshold under proposed special treatment for exclusively MSA-dominant or exclusively rural LTCHs.  
     
   Moratorium on New LTCHs, LTCH Satellite Facilities and LTCH Beds   
     
  The Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 imposed a moratorium on the establishment and classification of new LTCHs, LTCH satellite facilities and LTCH beds in existing LTCHs or satellite facilities subject to certain exceptions through December 28, 2012. The BBA of 2013, as amended by the PAMA, reinstated the moratorium on the establishment and classification of new LTCHs or LTCH satellite facilities, and on the increase of LTCH beds in existing LTCHs or satellite facilities beginning April 1, 2014 through

    Medicare Reimbursement of Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Services    
     
  The following is a summary of significant changes to the Medicare prospective payment system for IRFs which have affected our results of operations during the periods presented in this report, as well as the policies and payment rates for fiscal year 2016 which affect our patient discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015.  
     
   Fiscal Year 2015.    On August 6, 2014, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2015 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015). The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2015 was set at $15,198, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2014 of $14,846. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2015 included a market basket increase of 2.9%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.5%, and less a reduction of 0.2% mandated by the ACA. CMS decreased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2015 to $8,848 from $9,272 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2014. 
     
   Fiscal Year 2016.    On August 6, 2015, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2016 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016). The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2016 was set at $15,478, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2015 of $15,198. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2016 includes a market basket increase of 2.4%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.5%, and less a reduction of 0.2% mandated by the ACA. CMS decreased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2016 to $8,658 from $8,848 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2015. 
     
   Fiscal Year 2017.   On August 5, 2016, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2017 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017). The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2017 was set at $15,708, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2016 of $15,478. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2017 includes a market basket increase of 2.7%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.3%, and less a reduction of 0.75% mandated by the ACA. CMS decreased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2017 to $7,984 from $8,658 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2016. 
     
   Medicare Market Basket Adjustments   
     
  The ACA instituted a market basket payment adjustment for IRFs. In fiscal years 2017 through 2019, the market basket update will be reduced by 0.75%. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 sets the annual update for fiscal year 2018 at 1% after taking into account the market basket payment reduction of 0.75% mandated by the ACA. The ACA specifically allows these market basket reductions to result in less than a 0% payment update and payment rates that are less than the prior year.  
     
    Medicare Reimbursement of Outpatient Rehabilitation Services    
     
  The Medicare program reimburses outpatient rehabilitation providers based on the Medicare physician fee schedule. Historically, the Medicare physician fee schedule rates have updated annually based on the SGR formula. The SGR formula has resulted in automatic reductions in rates every year since 2002; however, for

Table of Contents   
     
  each year through March 31, 2015, CMS or Congress has taken action to prevent the SGR formula reductions. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 repeals the SGR formula effective for services provided on or after January 1, 2015, and establishes a new payment framework consisting of specified updates to the Medicare physician fee schedule, a new MIPS, and APMs. For services provided between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2015, a 0% payment update was applied to the Medicare physician fee schedule payment rates. For services provided between July 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015, a 0.5% update was applied to the fee schedule payment rates. For services provided in 2016 through 2019, a 0.5% update will be applied each year to the fee schedule payment rates, subject to MIPS adjustment beginning in 2019. For services provided in 2020 through 2025, a 0.0% percent update will be applied each year to the fee schedule payment rates, subject to MIPS and APM adjustments. Finally, in 2026 and subsequent years eligible professionals participating in APMs that meet certain criteria would receive annual updates of 0.75%, while all other professionals would receive annual updates of 0.25%.  
     
  The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 requires that payments under the fee schedule be adjusted starting in 2019 based on performance in MIPS, which will consolidate the three existing incentive programs focused on quality, resource use, and meaningful use of electronic health records. The law requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish the MIPS requirements under which a provider s performance is assessed according to established performance standards and used to determine an adjustment factor that is then applied to the professional s payment for a year. Each year from 2019-2024 professionals who receive a significant share of their revenues through an APM (such as accountable care organizations or bundled payment arrangements) that involves risk of financial losses and a quality measurement component will receive a 5% bonus. The bonus payment for APM participation is intended to encourage participation and testing of new APMs and promotes the alignment of incentives across payors. The specifics of the MIPS and APM adjustments beginning in 2019 and 2020, respectively, will be subject to future notice and comment rule-making. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we received approximately 11% of our outpatient rehabilitation net operating revenues from Medicare.

   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   
     
  In the following, we discuss our results of operations related to net operating revenues, operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, income from operations, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, non-operating gain (loss), interest expense, income taxes, and non-controlling interest, which, in each case, are the same for Holdings and Select.  
     
    Net Operating Revenues    
     
  Our net operating revenues increased by 3.2% to $1,053.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,021.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, principally due to the acquisition of Physiotherapy on March 4, 2016.  
     
   Specialty Hospitals  . Our specialty hospitals segment net operating revenues declined 3.2% to $544.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $562.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The primary reason for this decrease was a decline in our patient days which decreased 12.5% to 296,202 days for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 338,412 days for the three months ended September 30, 2015. As discussed above under   Regulatory Changes   Medicare Reimbursement of LTCH Services   Patient Criteria ,  new Medicare regulations, which establish new payment limits for Medicare patients discharged from an LTCH who do not meet specified patient criteria, began to be phased in to our LTCHs in the fourth quarter of 2015. We experienced fewer Medicare patient days during the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to changes we implemented at our LTCHs operating under the new Medicare patient criteria regulations, and specialty hospital closures and sales. This decrease in patient days was offset in part by increases in our Medicare net revenue per patient day. Our average net revenue per patient day for all of our specialty hospitals increased 7.9% to $1,642 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,522 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, principally as a result of increases in our Medicare net revenue per patient day. The increase in our Medicare net revenue per patient day resulted primarily from the increase in patient acuity at LTCHs now operating under the Medicare patient criteria

  regulations. Our occupancy percentage declined to 62% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 71% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Outpatient Rehabilitation  . Our outpatient rehabilitation segment net operating revenues increased 25.6% to $250.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $199.6 million for three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase resulted from growth in our outpatient rehabilitation clinics, offset in part by the sale of our contract therapy businesses. Patient visits in our outpatient clinics were 2,052,678 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 1,306,637 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase resulted principally from our newly acquired outpatient rehabilitation clinics, as well as growth in our existing owned outpatient rehabilitation clinics. Net revenue per visit in our owned outpatient rehabilitation clinics was $102 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $103 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
     
   Concentra Segment  . Net operating revenues were $258.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $259.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Net revenue per visit was $119 and visits were 1,906,242 in the centers for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net revenue per visit of $114 and 1,980,496 visits in the centers for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in visits was primarily driven by declines in consumer health and employer services. Visits related to workers compensation services were comparable in both periods. The decline in consumer health visits has resulted from our decision to emphasize our efforts on workers compensation services. The increase in revenue per visit was principally due to an increase per visit for workers compensation services. 
     
    Operating Expenses    
     
  Our operating expenses include our cost of services, general and administrative expense, and bad debt expense. Our operating expenses increased to $960.5 million, or 91.1% of net operating revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $941.4 million, or 92.2% of net operating revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating expenses is principally due to the acquisition of Physiotherapy on March 4, 2016. Our cost of services, a major component of which is labor expense, was $915.7 million, or 86.9% of net operating revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $900.9 million, or 88.2% of net operating revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of services as a percentage of net operating revenues resulted principally from a decrease in expenses relative to revenues at our Concentra segment as a result of cost saving initiatives we have implemented. Facility rent expense, a component of cost of services, was $58.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $47.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. General and administrative expenses were $27.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $22.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our bad debt expense was $17.7 million, or 1.7% of net operating revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $18.3 million, or 1.8% of net operating revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
    Adjusted EBITDA    
     
   Specialty Hospitals.   Adjusted EBITDA for our specialty hospitals was $48.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $53.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment was 8.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 9.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The reduction in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for our specialty hospitals segment was principally attributable to Adjusted EBITDA losses resulting from start-up specialty hospitals, Adjusted EBITDA losses on newly acquired specialty hospitals, and specialty hospital closures. Start-up specialty hospitals incurred $9.0 million of Adjusted

Table of Contents   
     
  EBITDA losses in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, as discussed under   Summary Financial Results   above.  
     
   Outpatient Rehabilitation.   Adjusted EBITDA for our outpatient rehabilitation segment increased 34.4% to $32.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $23.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for our outpatient rehabilitation segment was principally attributable to clinics acquired during the year. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the outpatient rehabilitation segment was 12.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 11.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The margin increase was principally due to the sale of our contract therapy businesses, which historically operated at lower Adjusted EBITDA margins. 
     
   Concentra Segment.   Adjusted EBITDA for our Concentra segment was $40.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $25.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Concentra segment was 15.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 9.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increases in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins were principally due to cost reductions we have implemented. 
     
   Other.   Adjusted EBITDA loss was $23.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $18.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
     
    Depreciation and Amortization    
     
   For the three months ended September 30, 2016, depreciation and amortization expense was $37.2 million, compared to $ 31.5  million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was principally due to the acquisitions of Concentra on June 1, 2015 and Physiotherapy on March 4, 2016. 
     
    Income from Operations    
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had income from operations of $56.2 million, compared to $ 48.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was principally due to the cost saving initiatives in our Concentra segment and the acquisition of Physiotherapy on March 4, 2016. 
     
    Loss on Early Retirement of Debt    
     
  On September 26, 2016, Concentra prepaid the second lien term loan under the Concentra credit facilities. The premium plus the expensing of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issuance discount resulted in a loss on early retirement of debt of $10.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
    Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries    
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of $5.3 million, compared to equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of $6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries was principally due to the sale of a start-up company in which we owned a non-controlling interest.  
     
 51   

Table of Contents   
     
    Non-Operating Gain (Loss)    
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had a non-operating loss of $1.0 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, we had a non-operating gain of $29.6 million on the sale of an equity investment. The equity investment was a start-up company investment in which we owned a non-controlling interest.  
     
    Interest Expense    
     
  Interest expense was $44.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $33.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was principally the result of increases in our indebtedness used to finance the acquisition of Physiotherapy on March 4, 2016, and increases in our interest rates associated with amendments of Select s credit facilities in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.  
     
    Income Taxes    
     
  We recorded income tax expense of $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which represented an effective tax rate of 21.2%. We recorded income tax expense of $18.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, which represented an effective tax rate of 35.9%.  
     
  Our quarterly effective income tax rate is derived from our full year estimated effective income tax rate and can be impacted by discrete items specific to a particular quarter and quarterly changes in our full year tax provision estimate.  
     
    Non-controlling Interests    
     
  Net losses attributable to non-controlling interests were $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income attributable to non-controlling interests of $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is principally due to losses at start-up specialty hospitals as discussed under   Summary Financial Results   above. These amounts represent the minority owner s share of income and losses for these consolidated entities.  
     
   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   
     
  In the following, we discuss our results of operations related to net operating revenues, operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, income from operations, loss on early retirement of debt, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, non-operating gain (loss), interest expense, income taxes, and non-controlling interest, which, in each case, are the same for Holdings and Select.  
     
    Net Operating Revenues    
     
  Our net operating revenues increased by 19.8% to $3,239.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,703.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, principally due to the acquisitions of Concentra on June 1, 2015 and Physiotherapy on March 4, 2016.  
     
   Specialty Hospitals  . Our specialty hospitals segment net operating revenues declined 1.4% to $1,729.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,753.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The primary reason for this decrease was a decline in our patient days which decreased 
     
 52   

Table of Contents   
     
  8.0% to 951,292 days for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 1,034,166 days for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. As discussed above under   Regulatory Changes   Medicare Reimbursement of LTCH Services   Patient Criteria ,  new Medicare regulations, which establish new payment limits for Medicare patients discharged from an LTCH who do not meet specified patient criteria, began to be phased in to our LTCHs in the fourth quarter of 2015.  We experienced fewer Medicare patient days due to changes we implemented at LTCHs operating under the new Medicare patient criteria regulations, and specialty hospital closures and sales. This decrease in patient days was offset in part by increases in our Medicare net revenue per patient day. Our average net revenue per patient day for all of our specialty hospitals increased 5.6% to $1,651 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,563 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, principally as a result of increases in our Medicare net revenue per patient day. The increase in our Medicare net revenue per patient day resulted primarily from the increase in patient acuity at LTCHs now operating under the Medicare patient criteria regulations. Our occupancy percentage declined to 67% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 72% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Outpatient Rehabilitation  . Our outpatient rehabilitation segment net operating revenues increased 23.5% to $745.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $603.8 million for nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was due to an increase in visits resulting principally from our newly acquired outpatient rehabilitation clinics and growth in our existing owned outpatient rehabilitation clinics. Net revenue per visit in our owned outpatient rehabilitation clinics was $102 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $103 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
     
   Concentra Segment  .  Net operating revenues were $764.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $345.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which includes results beginning June 1, 2015.  Net revenue per visit was $118 and visits were 5,642,305 in the centers for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net revenue per visit of $114 and 2,654,330 visits in the centers for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which includes results beginning June 1, 2015. 
     
    Operating Expenses    
     
  Our operating expenses include our cost of services, general and administrative expense, and bad debt expense. Our operating expenses increased to $2,887.8 million, or 89.1% of net operating revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,420.4 million, or 89.5% of net operating revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating expenses is principally due to the acquisitions of Concentra on June 1, 2015 and Physiotherapy on March 4, 2016. Our cost of services, a major component of which is labor expense, was $2,755.0 million, or 85.0% of net operating revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,309.2 million, or 85.4% of net operating revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of services as a percentage of net operating revenues resulted principally from Concentra and an increase in expenses relative to revenues at our specialty hospitals. Facility rent expense, a component of cost of services, was $167.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $118.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. General and administrative expenses were $81.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included $3.2 million of Physiotherapy acquisition costs, compared to $67.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which included $4.7 million of Concentra acquisition costs. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues were 2.5% for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Our general and administrative function includes our shared services activities which have grown and expanded as a result of our significant business acquisitions. Our bad debt expense was $51.6 million, or 1.6% of net operating revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $43.2 million, or 1.6% of net operating revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

    Adjusted EBITDA    
     
   Specialty Hospitals.   Adjusted EBITDA for our specialty hospitals was $217.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $241.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment was 12.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 13.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The reduction in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for our specialty hospitals segment was principally attributable to Adjusted EBITDA losses resulting from start-up hospitals, Adjusted EBITDA losses of newly acquired specialty hospitals, and specialty hospital closures. Start-up specialty hospitals incurred $19.4 million of Adjusted EBITDA losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $11.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as discussed under   Summary Financial Results   above. We also experienced a decline in Adjusted EBITDA in our LTCHs as a result of a decrease in patient days as discussed above under   Net Operating Revenues .  
     
   Outpatient Rehabilitation.   Adjusted EBITDA for our outpatient rehabilitation segment increased 32.6% to $99.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $74.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was principally due to the acquisition of Physiotherapy on March 4, 2016. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the outpatient rehabilitation segment was 13.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 12.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was principally due to the sale of our contract therapy businesses, which historically operated at lower Adjusted EBITDA margins. 
     
   Concentra Segment.   Adjusted EBITDA for our Concentra segment was $118.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $36.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which includes results beginning June 1, 2015.  Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Concentra segment was 15.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 10.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increases in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins were principally due to cost reductions we have implemented. 
     
   Other.   Adjusted EBITDA loss was $66.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $54.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
     
    Depreciation and Amortization    
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, depreciation and amortization expense was $107.9 million, compared to $70.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was principally due to the acquisitions of Concentra on June 1, 2015, and Physiotherapy on March 4, 2016.  
     
    Income from Operations    
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had income from operations of $244.1 million, compared to $212.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was principally due to the acquisitions of Concentra on June 1, 2015, and Physiotherapy on March 4, 2016.  
     
    Loss on Early Retirement of Debt    
     
  On March 4, 2016, we prepaid the Series D Tranche B Term Loans under the Select credit facilities, which resulted in the recognition of approximately a $0.8 million loss on early retirement of debt. On September 26, 2016, Concentra prepaid the second lien term loan under the Concentra credit facilities. The  
     
 54   

Table of Contents   
     
  premium plus the expensing of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issuance discount resulted in a loss on early retirement of debt of approximately $10.9 million.  
     
    Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries    
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of $14.5 million, compared to equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of $12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries resulted from increased earnings associated with several of our inpatient rehabilitation joint ventures in which we own a non-controlling interest.  
     
    Non-Operating Gain    
     
  The Company recognized a non-operating gain of $42.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company sold its contract therapy businesses for $65.0 million, resulting in a non-operating gain of $33.9 million. The Company also transferred five specialty hospitals in an exchange transaction and sold nine outpatient rehabilitation clinics, to a non-consolidating subsidiary, which resulted in non-operating gains of $6.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively,  as discussed above under   Significant Events .  Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an entity in which the Company owned a non-controlling interest was sold, which resulted in a non-operating loss of $5.1 million. 
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we had a non-operating gain of $29.6 million on the sale of an equity investment. The equity investment was a start-up company investment in which we owned a non-controlling interest.  
     
    Interest Expense    
     
  Interest expense was $127.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $79.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was principally the result of increases in our indebtedness used to finance the acquisitions of Concentra on June 1, 2015 and Physiotherapy on March 4, 2016, and increases in our interest rates associated with amendments of Select s credit facilities in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.  
     
    Income Taxes    
     
  We recorded income tax expense of $51.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which represented an effective tax rate of 33.0%.  We recorded income tax expense of $65.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which represented an effective tax rate of 37.1%.  
     
  Our effective income tax rate is derived from our full year estimated effective income tax rate and can be impacted by discrete items specific to a particular quarter and quarterly changes in our full year tax provision estimate. On March 31, 2016, we sold our contract therapy businesses. For tax purposes, the sale was treated as a discrete tax event particular to the first quarter of 2016. Our tax basis in our contract therapy businesses exceeded our selling price. As a result, we had no tax expense from the sale.  Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we exchanged five specialty hospitals in a hospital swap transaction.  For tax purposes, the exchange was treated as a discrete tax event particular to the second quarter of 2016.  Our tax basis in the five specialty hospitals was less than our book basis and resulted in a tax gain exceeding our book gain.  The lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from the effects of the two discrete tax events discussed above.

    Non-Controlling Interests    
     
  Non-controlling interests in consolidated earnings were $9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase is principally due to the acquisition of Concentra, offset in part by the minority interest owners  share of losses from new specialty hospitals.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
    Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

In the following, we discuss cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities, which, in each case, are the same for Holdings and Select.  
     
  Operating activities provided $280.2 million of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $203.4 million of cash flows provided for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is principally due to cash flows provided from Concentra which was acquired on June 1, 2015, Physiotherapy which was acquired on March 4, 2016, and cash distributions we received from unconsolidated investments in which we are minority owners.  
     
  Our days sales outstanding were 52 days at September 30, 2016, compared to 53 days at December 31, 2015 and 52 days at September 30, 2015. Our days sales outstanding will fluctuate based upon variability in our collection cycles. Our days sales outstanding at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 all fall within our expected range.  
     
  Investing activities used $463.0 million of cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, principally due to the acquisition of Physiotherapy. Investing activities also included $118.3 million for purchases of property and equipment, offset in part by proceeds from the sale of businesses of $71.4 million. Investing activities used $1,130.9 million of cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, principally due to $1,047.2 million related to the Concentra acquisition and $114.0 million for purchases of property and equipment.  
     
  Financing activities for Select provided $236.5 million of cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The principal source of cash was the issuance of $625.0 million aggregate principal amount of Series F Tranche B Term Loans under the Select credit facilities, resulting in net proceeds of $600.1 million, offset by $215.7 million of cash used to repay the Series D Tranche B Term Loans under the Select credit facilities and $125.0 million of net repayments under the Select and Concentra revolving facilities.

Table of Contents   
     
  Financing activities provided $946.8 million of cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The principal sources of cash for financing activities were $165.0 million of net borrowings under the Select revolving facility, $646.9 million borrowed under the Concentra credit facilities, and $217.1 million attributable to a non-consolidating interest in Group Holdings.  
     
    Capital Resources    
     
   Working capital   - We had net working capital of $255.4 million at September 30, 2016 compared to net working capital of $19.9 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in net working capital is primarily due to the early retirement of Series D Tranche B Term Loans, which were classified as a current liability at December 31, 2015, and an increase in cash over the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
     
   Select credit facilities   - On March 2, 2016, Select made a principal prepayment of $10.2 million associated with the Select term loans in accordance with the provision in the Select credit facilities that requires mandatory prepayments of the Select term loans as a result of annual excess cash flow as defined in the Select credit facilities. 
     
  On March 4, 2016, Select entered into an Additional Credit Extension Amendment (the  Additional Credit Extension Amendment ) to Select s senior secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent and lender, and the additional lenders named therein (the  Select credit facilities ). The Additional Credit Extension Amendment (i) provided for the lenders named therein to make available an aggregate of $625.0 million of Series F Tranche B Term Loans, (ii) extended the financial covenants through March 3, 2021, (iii) added a 1.00% prepayment premium for prepayments made with new term loans on or prior to March 4, 2017 if such new term loans have  a lower yield than the Series F Tranche B Term Loans, and (iv) made certain other technical amendments to the Select credit facilities. The Series F Tranche B Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Select credit facilities, subject to an Adjusted LIBO Rate floor of 1.00%) plus 5.00% for Eurodollar Loans or the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Select credit facilities) plus 4.00% for Alternate Base Rate Loans (as defined in the Select credit facilities). Select is required to make principal payments on the Series F Tranche B Term Loans in quarterly installments on the last day of each of March, June, September and December, beginning June 30, 2016, in amounts equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Series F Tranche B Term Loans outstanding as of the date of the Additional Credit Extension Amendment. The balance of the Series F Tranche B Term Loans is payable on March 3, 2021. Except as specifically set forth in the Additional Credit Extension Amendment, the terms and conditions of the Series F Tranche B Term Loans are identical to the terms of the outstanding Series E Term B Loans under the Select credit facilities and the other loan documents to which Select is party.  
     
  Select used the proceeds of the Series F Tranche B Term Loans to (i) refinance in full the Series D Tranche B Term Loans due December 20, 2016, (ii) consummate the acquisition of Physiotherapy, and (iii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Physiotherapy, the refinancing, and the Additional Credit Extension Amendment.  
     
  As a result of the Additional Credit Extension Amendment relating to the Series F Tranche B Term Loans, the interest rate payable on the Series E Tranche B Term Loans was increased from Adjusted LIBO plus 4.00% (subject to an Adjusted LIBO rate floor of 1.00%), or Alternative Base Rate plus 3.00%, to Adjusted LIBO plus 5.00% (subject to an Adjusted LIBO rate floor of 1.00%), or Alternative Base Rate plus 4.00%.

Table of Contents   
     
  At September 30, 2016, Select had outstanding borrowings under the Select credit facilities of $1,149.3 million of Select term loans (excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs of $27.7 million) and borrowings of $175.0 million (excluding letters of credit) under the Select revolving facility. After giving effect to $39.7 million of outstanding letters of credit at September 30, 2016, Select had $235.3 million of availability under the Select revolving facility.  
     
  The Select credit facilities require Select to maintain certain leverage ratios (as defined in the Select credit facilities). For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, Select was required to maintain its leverage ratio at less than 5.75 to 1.00. Select s leverage ratio was 5.11 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2016.  
     
   Concentra credit facilities   - Select and Holdings are not parties to the Concentra credit facilities and are not obligors with respect to Concentra s debt under such agreements. While this debt is non-recourse to Select, it is included in Select s consolidated financial statements. 
     
  On September 26, 2016, Concentra entered into Amendment No. 1 (the  Concentra Credit Agreement Amendment ) to its first lien credit agreement (the  Concentra first lien credit agreement ) dated June 1, 2015. The Concentra first lien credit agreement initially provided for $500.0 million in first lien credit facilities composed of $450.0 million, seven-year term loans ( Concentra first lien term loan ) and a $50.0 million, five-year revolving credit facility ( Concentra revolving facility ).  
     
  The Concentra Credit Agreement Amendment provided an additional $200.0 million of first lien term loans due June 1, 2022, the proceeds of which were used to prepay in full Concentra s second lien term loan due June 1, 2023; and also amended certain restrictive covenants to give Concentra greater operational flexibility.  
     
  The Concentra first lien term loan continues to bear interest at a rate equal to Adjusted LIBO (as defined in the Concentra first lien credit agreement) plus 3.00% (subject to an Adjusted LIBO floor of 1.00%), or Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Concentra first lien credit agreement) plus 2.00% (subject to an Alternate Base Rate floor of 2.00%). The Concentra first lien term loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments of $1.6 million through March 31, 2022, with the remaining unamortized aggregate principal due on the maturity date.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, Concentra had outstanding borrowings of $643.9 million under the Concentra term loans (excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs of $16.6 million). Concentra did not have any borrowings under the Concentra revolving facility. After giving effect to $6.6 million of outstanding letters of credit at September 30, 2016, Concentra had $43.4 million of availability under its revolving facility.  
     
   Stock Repurchase Program   - Holdings  board of directors has authorized a common stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $500.0 million worth of shares of its common stock. The program has been extended until December 31, 2017 and will remain in effect until then, unless further extended or earlier terminated by the board of directors. Stock repurchases under this program may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, and at times and in such amounts as Holdings deems appropriate. Holdings is funding this program with cash on hand and borrowings under Select s revolving credit facility. Holdings did not repurchase shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Since the inception of the program through September 30, 2016, Holdings has repurchased 35,924,128 shares at a cost of approximately $314.7 million, or $8.76 per share, which includes transaction costs. 
     
   Liquidity   - We believe our internally generated cash flows and borrowing capacity under the Select and Concentra credit facilities will be sufficient to finance operations over the next twelve months. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, may be funded from operating cash flows or other sources and will depend on

  prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  
     
   Use of Capital Resources   - We may from time to time pursue opportunities to develop new joint venture relationships with significant health systems and other healthcare providers, and from time to time we may also develop new inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. We also intend to open new outpatient rehabilitation clinics in local areas that we currently serve where we can benefit from existing referral relationships and brand awareness to produce incremental growth. In addition to our development activities, we may grow our business through opportunistic acquisitions. 
     
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which addresses the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation , which simplifies various aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees. The areas for simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases . This ASU includes a lessee accounting model that recognizes two types of leases; finance and operating. This ASU requires that a lessee recognize on the balance sheet assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. Lessees will need to recognize almost all leases on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained the dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will depend on its classification as finance or operating lease. For short-term leases of twelve months or less, lessees are permitted to make an accounting election by class of underlying asset not to recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. If the alternative is elected, lease expense would be recognized generally on the straight-line basis over the respective lease term.  
     
  The amendments in ASU 2016-02 will take effect for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. A modified retrospective approach is required for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements.  The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which changes the presentation of deferred income taxes. The intent is to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes through the requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The revised guidance is effective for annual fiscal periods

  beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In May 2014, March 2016, and April 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Principal versus Agent Considerations , ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , and ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , respectively, which supersede most of the current revenue recognition requirements. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. New disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers are also required. The original standards were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016; however, in July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of these standards, with a new effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The standards require the selection of a modified retrospective or cumulative effect transition method for retrospective application.  The Company is currently evaluating the standards to determine the impact they will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In April and August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15, each titled  Interest- Imputation of Interest , to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The standard requires debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability. The FASB clarified that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements can be presented as an asset and amortized over the term of the arrangement. The Company adopted the standard at the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was retrospectively conformed to reflect the adoption of the standard and approximately $38.0 million of unamortized debt issuance costs were reclassified to be a direct reduction of debt, rather than a component of other assets.

   ITEM 3.                   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
     
   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   
     
  We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our variable rate long-term indebtedness. Our principal interest rate exposure relates to the loans outstanding under the Select credit facilities and Concentra credit facilities.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, Select had $1,149.3 million (excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs) in term loans outstanding under the Select credit facilities and $175.0 million in revolving borrowings outstanding under the Select credit facilities, which bear interest at variable rates.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, Concentra had outstanding borrowings under the Concentra credit facilities of $643.9 million (excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs) of term loans, which bear interest at variable rates. Concentra did not have any outstanding revolving borrowings.  Certain of Select s and Concentra s outstanding borrowings that bear interest at variable rates were effectively fixed as of September 30, 2016 based upon then current interest rates because the Adjusted LIBO Rate did not then exceed the applicable Adjusted LIBO Rate floors for such borrowings:  
     
                        Select s aggregate $527.4 million in Series E Tranche B Term Loans are subject to an Adjusted LIBO Rate floor of 1.00%. Therefore, until the Adjusted LIBO Rate exceeds 1.00%, Select s interest rate on this indebtedness is effectively fixed at 6.00%. 
     
                        Select s aggregate $621.9 million in Series F Tranche B Term Loans are subject to an Adjusted LIBO Rate floor of 1.00%. Therefore, until the Adjusted LIBO Rate exceeds 1.00%, Select s interest rate on this indebtedness is effectively fixed at 6.00%. 
     
                        The $643.9 million Concentra first lien term loan is subject to an Adjusted LIBO Rate floor of 1.00%. Therefore, until the Adjusted LIBO Rate exceeds 1.00%, Concentra s interest rate on this indebtedness is effectively fixed at 4.00%. 
     
  However, the Select and Concentra revolving borrowings are not subject to an Adjusted LIBO Rate floor.  
     
  The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical increases in market interest rates as of September 30, 2016 on our consolidated interest expense over the subsequent twelve month period:  

61   

Table of Contents   

(1)                                    Based on the 3-month LIBOR rate of 0.85% as of September 30, 2016, a change in interest rates of up to 0.15% would only increase interest expense with respect to the Select and Concentra revolving borrowings, which are not subject to an Adjusted LIBO Rate floor. Increases in interest rates greater than 0.15% as of September 30, 2016 would impact the interest rate paid on all of Select s and Concentra s variable rate debt, as indicated in the table above. 
     
   ITEM 4.                   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
     
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered in this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, including the accumulation and communication of disclosure to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure, are effective as of September 30, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be included in our periodic SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the relevant SEC rules and forms.  
     
   Physiotherapy Acquisition   
     
  On March 4, 2016, Select consummated the acquisition of Physiotherapy. SEC guidance permits management to omit an assessment of an acquired business  internal control over financial reporting from management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for a period not to exceed one year from the date of the acquisition.  
     
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
     
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that occurred during the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
     
   Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls   
     
  It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions.

   PART II                                                    OTHER INFORMATION    
     
   ITEM 1.                                                     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    
     
   Litigation   
     
  The Company is a party to various legal actions, proceedings and claims (some of which are not insured), and regulatory and other governmental audits and investigations in the ordinary course of its business. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, proceedings and regulatory and other governmental audits and investigations. These matters could potentially subject the Company to sanctions, damages, recoupments, fines and other penalties. The Department of Justice, CMS or other federal and state enforcement and regulatory agencies may conduct additional investigations related to the Company s businesses in the future that may, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.  
     
  To address claims arising out of the Company s operations, the Company maintains professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance, subject to self-insured retention of $2.0 million per medical incident for professional liability claims and $2.0 million per occurrence for general liability claims. The Company also maintains umbrella liability insurance covering claims which, due to their nature or amount, are not covered by or not fully covered by the Company s other insurance policies. These insurance policies also do not generally cover punitive damages and are subject to various deductibles and policy limits. Significant legal actions, as well as the cost and possible lack of available insurance, could subject the Company to substantial uninsured liabilities. In the Company s opinion, the outcome of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  
     
  Healthcare providers are subject to lawsuits under the qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act. Qui tam lawsuits typically remain under seal (hence, usually unknown to the defendant) for some time while the government decides whether or not to intervene on behalf of a private qui tam plaintiff (known as a relator) and take the lead in the litigation. These lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and penalties and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring the suits. The Company is and has been a defendant in these cases in the past, and may be named as a defendant in similar cases from time to time in the future.  
     
   Evansville Litigation  . On October 19, 2015, the plaintiff-relators filed a Second Amended Complaint in United States of America, ex rel. Tracy Conroy, Pamela Schenk and Lisa Wilson v. Select Medical Corporation, Select Specialty Hospital Evansville, LLC (  SSH-Evansville  ), Select Employment Services, Inc., and Dr. Richard Sloan. The case is a civil action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana by private plaintiff-relators on behalf of the United States under the federal False Claims Act. The plaintiff-relators are the former CEO and two former case managers at SSH-Evansville, and the defendants currently include the Company, SSH-Evansville, a subsidiary of the Company serving as common paymaster for its employees, and a physician who practices at SSH-Evansville. The plaintiff-relators allege that, from 2006 until April 2012, SSH-Evansville discharged patients too early or held patients too long, improperly discharged patients to and readmitted them from short stay hospitals, up-coded diagnoses at admission, and admitted patients for whom long-term acute care was not medically necessary. They also allege that the defendants engaged in retaliation in violation of federal and state law. The Second Amended Complaint replaces a prior complaint that was filed under seal on September 28, 2012 and served on the Company on February 15, 2013, after a federal magistrate judge unsealed it on January 8, 2013. All deadlines in the case had been stayed after the seal was lifted in order to allow the government time to complete its investigation and to decide whether or

  not to intervene. On June 19, 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice notified the District Court of its decision not to intervene in the case, and the District Court thereafter approved a case management plan imposing certain deadlines.  
     
  In December 2015, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on multiple grounds. One basis for the Motion to Dismiss was the False Claims Act s public disclosure bar, which disqualifies qui tam actions that are based on fraud already publicly disclosed through enumerated sources, unless the relator is an original source. The Affordable Care Act, enacted on March 23, 2010, altered the public disclosure bar language of the False Claims Act by, among other things, giving the United States the right to oppose dismissal of a case based on the public disclosure bar. In their Motion to Dismiss, the defendants contended that the public disclosure bar applies because substantially the same conduct as the plaintiff-relators have alleged had previously been publicly disclosed, including in a New York Times article and a prior qui tam case.  A second basis for the defendants  Motion to Dismiss was that the plaintiff-relators did not plead their claims with sufficient particularity, as required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  
     
  Then, based on the Affordable Care Act s changes to the public disclosure bar language of the False Claims Act, the United States filed a notice asserting a veto of the defendants  use of the public disclosure bar for claims arising from conduct from and after March 23, 2010. The defendants filed briefs challenging the United States  contention that the statutory changes gives it an unfettered right to veto the applicability of the public disclosure bar. On September 30, 2016, the District Court partially granted and partially denied the defendants  Motion to Dismiss. It ruled that the plaintiff-relators alleged substantially the same conduct as had been publicly disclosed and that the plaintiff relators are not original sources, so that the public disclosure bar requires dismissal of all non-retaliation claims arising from conduct before March 23, 2010.  The District Court also ruled that the statutory changes to the public disclosure bar gave the United States the power to veto its applicability to claims arising from conduct on and after March 23, 2010, and therefore did not dismiss those claims based on the public disclosure bar. However, the District Court ruled that the plaintiff-relators did not plead certain of their claims relating to interrupted stay manipulation and premature discharging of patients with the requisite particularity, and dismissed those claims. The District Court declined to dismiss the plaintiff-relators  claims arising from conduct from and after March 23, 2010 relating to delayed discharging of patients and upcoding and the plaintiff-relators  retaliation claims.  
     
  On October 17, 2016, the defendants filed a Motion seeking certification to file an interlocutory appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit of the District Court s ruling that the United States  has the power to veto the application of the public disclosure bar to the defendants  conduct from and after March 23, 2010. The Company intends to vigorously defend this action, but at this time the Company is unable to predict the timing and outcome of this matter.  
     
   Knoxville Litigation  . On July 13, 2015, the federal District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee unsealed a qui tam Complaint in Armes v. Garman, et al, No. 3:14-cv-00172-TAV-CCS, which named as defendants Select, Select Specialty Hospital Knoxville, Inc. (  SSH-Knoxville  ), Select Specialty Hospital North Knoxville, Inc. and ten current or former employees of these facilities. The Complaint was unsealed after the United States and the State of Tennessee notified the court on July 13, 2015 that each had decided not to intervene in the case. The Complaint is a civil action that was filed under seal on April 29, 2014 by a respiratory therapist formerly employed at SSH-Knoxville. The Complaint alleges violations of the federal False Claims Act and the Tennessee Medicaid False Claims Act based on extending patient stays to increase reimbursement and to increase average length of stay; artificially prolonging the lives of patients to increase Medicare reimbursements and decrease inspections; admitting patients who do not require medically necessary care; performing unnecessary procedures and services; and delaying performance of procedures to increase billing. The Complaint was served on some of the defendants during October 2015.

  In November 2015, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint on multiple grounds. The defendants first argued that False Claims Act s first-to-file bar required dismissal of plaintiff-relator s claims. Under the first-to-file bar, if a qui tam case is pending, no person may bring a related action based on the facts underlying the first action.  The defendants asserted that the plaintiff-relator s claims were based on the same underlying facts as were asserted in the Evansville litigation, discussed above. The defendants also argued that the plaintiff-relator s claims must be dismissed under the public disclosure bar, and because the plaintiff-relator did not plead his claims with sufficient particularity.  
     
  In June 2016, the District Court granted the defendants  Motion to Dismiss and dismissed the plaintiff-relator s lawsuit in its entirety. The District Court ruled that the first-to-file bar precludes all but one of the plaintiff-relator s claims, and that the remaining claim must also be dismissed because the plaintiff-relator failed to plead it with sufficient particularity. In July 2016, the plaintiff-relator filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Then, on October 11, 2016, the plaintiff-relator filed a Motion to Remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings, arguing that the September 30, 2016 decision in the Evansville litigation, discussed above, undermines the basis for the District Court s dismissal. The Company intends to vigorously defend this action, but at this time the Company is unable to predict the timing and outcome of this matter.

    Third Amendment to Lease Agreement

Such coverage shall insure against all liability of Tenant and its authorized representatives and visitors arising out of, and in connection with, Tenant s use or occupancy of the Premises. 
  (c)                                     Worker s Compensation and Employer s Liability Insurance, with a waiver of subrogation endorsement, in form and amount satisfactory to Landlord. 
  (d)                                    Any other form or forms of insurance as Tenant or Landlord or the mortgagees of Landlord may reasonably require from time to time in form, in amounts, and for insurance risks against which a prudent Tenant of a comparable size and in a comparable business would protect itself upon written notice to Tenant and provided that Tenant shall not be in default if Tenant is unable after good faith attempts to secure such insurance have been made by the Tenant. 
     
 11   

All policies shall be issued by insurers with a Best s Insurance Reports rating of A+ or better and shall be in form satisfactory to Landlord.  Tenant agrees that certificates of insurance on the Landlord s standard form, or certified copies of each such insurance policy, naming Landlord, its mortgagees and ground lessors (if any) as additional insured, will be delivered to Landlord not later than 5 days prior to the date that Tenant takes possession of any part of the Premises.  All policies shall contain an undertaking by the insurers to notify Landlord and the mortgagees of Landlord in writing, by Registered U.S. Mail, not less than 30 days before any material change, reduction in coverage, cancellation, or other termination thereof.

Landlord shall be named as an additional insured on Tenant s public liability insurance, and Tenant shall deliver a certificate of such insurance to Landlord not later than 5 days prior to the date that Tenant takes possession of any part of the Premises.  Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, take out and carry any other form or forms of insurance as it or Landlord s mortgagees may reasonably determine appropriate.

Landlord will not be required to carry insurance of any kind on any Non-Building Standard Leasehold Improvements, on Tenant s furniture or furnishings, or on any of Tenant s fixtures, equipment, improvements, or appurtenances under this Lease; and Landlord shall not be obligated to repair or replace same. 
     
   Section 15.03    Tenant shall not keep in the Premises any article which may be prohibited by any reasonable insurance policy periodically in force covering the Building.  If Tenant s occupancy results in any increase in premiums for the insurance carried by Landlord, Tenant shall pay any such increase in premiums as additional Rental within 10 days after being billed therefore.  Tenant shall promptly comply with all reasonable requirements of the insurance authority or any present or future insurer relating to the Premises and the Building. 
     
   Section 15.04    If any of Landlord s insurance policies shall be cancelled or cancellation shall be threatened or the coverage hereunder reduced or threatened to be reduced, or if the premiums on any of Landlord s insurance policies are increased or threatened to be increased, in any way because of Tenant s use of the Premises and, if Tenant fails to remedy the cause thereof within 48 hours after notice, Landlord may, at its option, either terminate this Lease or enter upon the Premises and attempt to remedy such condition, and Tenant shall promptly pay the cost thereof to Landlord as additional Rental.  Landlord shall not be liable for any damage or injury caused to any property of Tenant or of others located on the Premises resulting from such entry.  If Landlord is unable to remedy such condition, then Landlord shall have all of the remedies provided for in this Lease in the event of a default by Tenant. 
     
   Section 15.05    All policies covering real or personal property which either party obtains affecting the Premises shall include a clause or endorsement denying the insurer any rights of subrogation against the other party to the extent rights have been waived by the insured before the occurrence of injury or loss.  Landlord and Tenant hereby mutually waive any rights of recovery against the other for injury or loss due to hazards covered by insurance containing such a waiver of subrogation clause or endorsement to the extent of the injury or loss covered thereby. 
     
   Section 15.06    .Every policy of insurance maintained under this Article shall provide cross liability coverage and waiver of subrogation, if available, with respect to the Landlord and the Tenant and all other companies owned, operated or controlled by or affiliated with either of them and with respect to their officers, directors and employees.  Each of the Landlord and the Tenant may require the other to supply evidence thereof from time to time.  If such endorsement may be obtained only by payment of an additional premium, the other party, if it insists upon such an endorsement, shall pay such additional premium.  Every right, exemption from liability, defense and immunity of whatsoever nature applicable to the Landlord or the Tenant or to which either of them is entitled under this Lease shall also be available and shall extend to protect all other companies owned, operated or controlled by or affiliated with either of them and to protect their officers, directors and employees and for such purposes the Landlord or the Tenant, as the case may be, is or shall be deemed to be acting as agent or trustee on behalf of and for the benefit of such companies and persons. 
     
 12   

Section 15.07  .  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Lease, Tenant shall be permitted to satisfy any obligation to provide or maintain insurance coverage under a blanket umbrella policy or by a commercially reasonable program of self-insurance. 
     
    ARTICLE 16 - Damage by Fire or Other Cause    
     
   Section 16.01    Subject to Sections 16.02 and 16.03 hereof, if the Building is damaged by fire or other casualty so as to affect the Premises, Tenant shall immediately notify Landlord, who shall, but only if the proceeds from Landlord s insurance available to Landlord (i) are free from collection by Landlord s mortgagee and (ii) are sufficient, have the damage repaired, including any damages to the Leasehold Improvements, with reasonable speed at the expense of Landlord, subject to delays which may arise by reason of adjustment of loss under insurance policies and to other delays beyond Landlord s reasonable control.  Provided such damage was not the result of the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant, or Tenant s employees or invitees, an abatement in the Rental hereunder shall be allowed as to that portion of the Premises rendered untenantable by such damage until such time as Landlord determines that such damaged portion of the Premises has been made tenantable for Tenant s use. 
     
   Section 16.02    If the Premises are damaged or destroyed by any cause whatsoever, and if, in the Landlord s reasonable opinion the Premises cannot be rebuilt or made fit for Tenant s purposes within  150  days of the damage or destruction, or if the proceeds from insurance remaining after payment of any such proceeds to Landlord s mortgagee are insufficient to repair or restore the damage by destruction, Landlord may, at its respective option, terminate this Lease by giving the Tenant, within 30 days after such damage or destruction, notice of termination, and thereupon Rental and any other payments for which Tenant is liable under this Lease shall be apportioned and paid to the date of such damage, and Tenant shall immediately vacate the Premises, provided, however, that those provisions of this Lease which are designated to cover matters of termination and the period thereafter shall survive the termination hereof. 
     
   Section 16.03    If either 
     
  (a)                                    the Building is damaged or destroyed to the extent that, in Landlord s reasonable opinion it would not be economically feasible to repair or restore such damage or destruction, or 
  (b)                                    in Landlord s reasonable judgment, the damage or destruction to the Building cannot be repaired or restored within  150  days after such damage or destruction, 
     
  Landlord may, at its respective option, terminate this Lease by giving the Tenant, within  60  days after such damage, notice of such termination, thereby requiring Tenant to vacate the Premises 30 days after delivery of the notice of termination, and thereupon Rental and any other payments shall be apportioned and paid to the date on which possession is relinquished and Tenant shall immediately vacate the Premises according to such notice of termination, provided, however, that those provisions of this Lease which are designed to cover matters of termination and the period thereafter shall survive the termination hereof.  
     
   Section 16.04    No damages shall be payable by Landlord for inconvenience, loss of business, or annoyance arising from any repair or restoration of any portion of the Premises, or the Building unless caused by the sole negligence of Landlord or Landlord s employees, agents, representatives or contractors.  Landlord shall use its best efforts to have such repairs made promptly so as not to unnecessarily interfere with Tenant s occupancy and use of the Premises, the Building and the Property. 
     
   Section 16.05    The provisions of this Article shall be considered an express agreement governing any case of damage or destruction of the Building, the Building Standard Leasehold Improvements, the Tenant s Improvements, the alterations, or the Premises by fire or other casualty. 
     
    ARTICLE 17 - Condemnation

All proceeds from any taking or condemnation shall belong to and be paid to Landlord, except to the extent of any proceeds awarded to Tenant on account of moving and relocation expenses and depreciation to and removal of Tenant s physical property.  
     
 13   

ARTICLE 18 - Assignment and Subletting    
     
   Section 18.01    If Tenant should desire to assign this Lease or sublet the Premises (or any part thereof), Tenant shall give Landlord written notice at least  60  days in advance thereof.  Landlord shall then have a period of 30 days following receipt of such notice within which to notify Tenant in writing that Landlord elects either: 
     
  (a)                                    to terminate this Lease as to the space so affected by Tenant in its notice, in which event Tenant, subject to the provisions of this Lease which expressly survive the termination hereof, shall be relieved of all further obligations hereunder as to such space; 
  (b)                                    to permit Tenant to assign or sublet such space, subject, however, to the subsequent written approval of the proposed assignee or subtenant by Landlord, and provided that if the Rental rate agreed upon between Tenant and its proposed subtenant is greater than the Rental rate that Tenant must pay Landlord hereunder, then 100% of such excess Rental shall be considered additional Rental owed by Tenant to Landlord, and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord in the same manner that Tenant pays Annual Base Rental; or 
  (c)                                     to refuse to consent to Tenant s assignment or subleasing of such space, provided such refusal notwithstanding anything contained in legislation, law or statute, as the same may be amended from time to time, the Landlord, shall not be deemed to be unreasonable in withholding its consent and may arbitrarily withhold its consent until and unless the proposed assignee or sub-lessee shall have agreed in writing with Landlord to assume and perform each of the covenants, obligations, and agreements of the Tenant in this Lease including, without limitation, the provision of the entry of judgment by confession for monetary damages and possession as set forth in Section 24.02. 
     
  No assignment or subletting by Tenant shall relieve Tenant of Tenant s obligations under this Lease.  Any attempted assignment or sublease by Tenant in violation of the terms and provisions of this Section 18.01 shall be void.  In no event shall Tenant solicit assignees or sub lessees in other Buildings owned by Landlord, or at less than a fair market rate.  
     
  In the event of an assignment of this Lease, the assignee, for purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to have adopted the warrants of attorney and confession of judgment, set forth in Section 24.02 as if the assignee has executed the same.  
     
   Section 18.02                          Landlord may sell, transfer, assign, and convey all or any part of the Building and any and all of its rights under this Lease, provided Landlord s successor in interest assumes Landlord s obligations hereunder, and in the event Landlord assigns its rights under this Lease, Landlord shall be released from any further obligations hereunder, and Tenant agrees to look solely to Landlord s successor in interest for performance of such obligations. 
     
    ARTICLE 19 - Indemnification

Tenant s foregoing indemnity obligation shall include reasonable attorneys  fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Landlord.  If Landlord is made a party to any litigation commenced by or against Tenant or relating to this Lease or to the Premises, and provided that in any such litigation, Landlord is not finally adjudicated to be at fault, then Tenant shall pay all costs and expenses, including attorneys  fees and court costs, incurred by or imposed upon Landlord because of any such litigation, and the amount of all such costs and expenses, including attorneys  fees and court costs, shall be a demand obligation owing by Tenant to Landlord, and shall be considered as additional Rental.  
     
  Except to the extent provided in this Lease, the Landlord shall not be liable or responsible in any way for any loss, damage or injury of any nature whatever that may be suffered or sustained to any persons or property, and in particular, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Landlord shall not be liable for any loss, damage or injury of any nature whatever to any person or property:

  (e)             Resulting from anything done or omitted to be done by the Landlord, its servants, employees, agents, contractors, officers, customers, invitees or licensees, by other occupants of the Building, by persons in the Premise or in the Building, by occupants of adjacent property or by the public. 
     
  The Tenant shall not be entitled to any abatement of rent in respect of any such loss, damage or injury, condition, failure or interruption of service, nor shall the same constitute an eviction.  
     
  The provisions of this Article 19 shall survive the termination of this Lease with respect to any damage, injury, or death occurring before such termination.  
     
    ARTICLE 20 - Surrender of the Premises    
     
   Section 20.01         Upon the expiration or other termination of this Lease for any cause whatsoever, Tenant shall peacefully vacate the Premises in as good order and condition as the same were at the beginning of the Term or may thereafter have been improved by Landlord or Tenant, subject only to reasonable use and wear and fire and casualty thereof. 
     
   Section 20.02         Landlord must approve in writing Tenant s removal of any Non-Standard Building Improvements, alterations, and physical additions installed in the Premises upon termination of this Lease.

Tenant agrees to remove, at Tenant s expense, all of its furniture, furnishings, personal property, and moveable trade fixtures by the Expiration Date, and shall promptly reimburse Landlord for the cost of repairing all damage done to the Premises or the Building by such removal. 
     
   Section 20.03         Should Tenant continue to hold the Premises after the termination of this Lease, whether the termination occurs by lapse of time or otherwise, such holding over shall, unless otherwise agreed to by Landlord in writing, constitute and be construed as a tenancy at will at a monthly Rental equal to two (2)times the monthly Rental Rate for the Premises as of the date of termination, and subject to all of the other terms set forth herein except any right to renew or expand this Lease.  Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for all damage which Landlord suffers because of any holding over by Tenant, and Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against all claims made by any other Tenant or prospective Tenant against Landlord resulting from delay by Landlord in delivering possession of the Premises to such other Tenant or prospective Tenant.

To the extent any such statements requested are not true, Tenant shall explain such facts in writing.  Landlord agrees periodically to furnish, when reasonably requested in writing by Tenant, certificates signed by Landlord containing substantially the same information as described above.  
     
 15   

ARTICLE 22 - Subordination    
     
   Section 22.01         This Lease is subject and subordinate to any deeds of trust, mortgages, or other security instruments, and any other supplements or amendments thereto, which presently or may in the future cover the Building and the Land or any interest of Landlord therein, and to any increases, renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements, and extensions of any of such deeds of trust, mortgages, or security instruments.  Landlord agrees to use his best efforts to obtain for Tenant a  non-disturbance  agreement from the holder or beneficiary of any deeds of trust, mortgages or other security instruments that in the future may cover the Building and the Land or any interest of Landlord therein.  This provision is declared by Landlord and Tenant to be self-operative and no further instrument shall be required to effect such subordination of this Lease.  Tenant shall, however, upon demand, execute, acknowledge, and deliver to Landlord any further instruments and certificates evidencing such subordination as Landlord may require.  This Lease is further subject and subordinate to utility easements and agreements, covenants, restrictions, and other encumbrances which do not materially adversely effect Tenant s intended use of the Premises, both existing and future. 
     
   Section 22.02         Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing provisions of Section 22.01 hereof, any such mortgagee shall have the right at any time to subordinate any such ground or primary Leases, deeds of trust, mortgages, or other security instruments to this Lease on such terms and subject to such conditions as such mortgagee or ground or primary lessor may consider appropriate in its discretion.  At any time, before or after the institution of any proceedings for the foreclosure of any such deeds of trust, mortgages, or other security instruments, or sale of the Building under any such deeds of trust, mortgages, or other security instruments or termination of any ground or primary Lease, Tenant shall attorn to such purchaser upon any such sale or the grantee under any deed in lieu of such foreclosure and shall recognize such purchaser or grantee as Landlord under this Lease.  The agreement of Tenant to attorn contained in the immediately preceding sentence shall survive any foreclosure sale, trustee s sale, or conveyance in lieu thereof.  Tenant shall upon demanded at any time, before or after any such sale, execute, acknowledge, and deliver to Landlord s mortgagee any written instruments and certificates evidencing such attornment as Landlord s mortgagee may reasonably require. 
     
    ARTICLE 23 - Parking

    ARTICLE 24 - Default and Remedies

  (a)                                    if Tenant fails to pay any Rental by the first day of each month or fails to pay other sums payable by Tenant hereunder by the first day of each month and fails to pay such sums within three (3) days of written notice thereof from Landlord (provided, however, if such event of default shall occur more than once in every 6 months period, Landlord shall not be required to provide any written notice of default, not provide any cure period and an event of default shall occur as and when such Rental or other sums becomes due and payable; or 
  (b)                                    if Tenant shall fail to perform or observe any other term hereof or any of the Rules and Regulations and such failure shall continue for more than 30 days after notice thereof from Landlord. 
  (c)                                     if any petition is filed by or against Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant s obligations under this Lease under any section or chapter of the present or future Bankruptcy Code or under any similar law or statute of the United States or any state thereof; 
  (d)                                    if Tenant or guarantor of Tenant s obligations under this Lease becomes insolvent or is determined to be insolvent or makes a transfer in fraud of creditors; 
  (e)                                     if Tenant fails to take occupancy within 30 days of the commencement date; 
  (f)                                      if Tenant or guarantor of tenant s obligations under this Lease, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or 
  (g)                                     if a receiver, custodian or trustee is appointed for Tenant or for any of the assets of the Tenant which appointment is not vacated within 30 days of the date of such appointment. 
     
   Section 24.02         If an event of default occurs, at any time thereafter Landlord may do one or more of the following without any additional notice or demand: 
     
 16   

(a)                                    Terminate this Lease by giving written notice of the termination to the Tenant, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord.  If Tenant fails to do so, Landlord may, without notice and without prejudice to any other remedy Landlord may have, enter upon and take possession of the Premises and expel or remove Tenant and its effects without being liable to prosecution or any claim for damages therefore; and Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for all loss and damage which Landlord may suffer by reason of such termination, whether through inability to re-let the Premises or otherwise, including any loss of Rental for the remainder of the Term.  Any such loss of Rental shall be offset by any Rental received by Landlord as a result of re-letting the Premises during the remainder of the Term. 
  (b)                                    Terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant s event of default shall be considered a total breach of Tenant s obligations under this Lease and Tenant immediately shall become liable for such damages for such breach amount, equal to the total of: 
     
  (1)                                    the costs of recovering the Premises; 
  (2)                                    the unpaid Rental due for the remaining term as of the date of termination, plus interest thereon at a rate per annum from the due date equal to 18% over the Prime Rate. 
  (3)                                    the total Rental and other benefits which Landlord would have received under the Lease for the remainder of the Term, at the rates then in effect, together with all other expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with Tenant s default. 
  (4)                                    all other sums of money and damages owing by Tenant and Landlord. 
     
  (c)                                     Enter upon and take possession of the Premises as Tenant s agent without terminating this Lease and without being liable to prosecution or any claim for damages therefore, and Landlord may re-let the Premises as Tenant s agent and receive the Rental therefore, in which event Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand the reasonable cost of renovating and repairing the Premises for a new Tenant or Tenants and any deficiency that may arise by reason of such re-letting; shall not release or affect Tenant s liability for Rental or for damages. 
  (d)                                    Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default which is not cured by the Tenant within the period of time provided herein, if any is so provided by the terms of this Lease, the Tenant hereby empowers any Prothonotary or any attorney of any court of record within the United States or elsewhere to appear for the Tenant, with declaration filed, and confess judgment against the Tenant in favor of the Landlord, its successors or assigns, as of any term, for any determined amount to which the Landlord would be entitled as damages under the provisions hereof including also any attorney fees for collection of the same plus ten percent (10%) of the total amount of such damages, together with costs of suit, and the Tenant hereby waives all errors, defects and imperfections in entering said judgment or in any writ, or process, or proceeding thereon or thereto or in anyway touching or concerning the same; and for the confession and entry of such judgment, this Lease or a true and correct copy thereof shall be sufficient warrant and authority.  The authority and power contained herein shall not be exhausted by one exercise thereof, but judgment may be confessed as aforesaid from time to time and as often as there is an occurrence of any Event of Default which is not cured by the Tenant as provided herein, or in the event of an Event of Default as defined herein; and furthermore such authority and power may be exercised during the original and any extension or renewal thereof, or after the expiration or earlier termination of the term hereof.  The interest rate of one and one-half percent per month (1.5% per month) shall survive the entering of judgment. 
  (e)                                     When this lease shall be terminated or cancelled by reason of breach of any provision hereof, either during the original term of this lease or any renewal thereof, and also as soon as the term hereby created or any renewal thereof shall have expired, it shall be lawful for any attorney as attorney for Tenant to file an agreement for entering in any court of competent jurisdiction an amicable action and confession of judgment in ejectment against the Tenant and all persons claiming under the Tenant for the recovery by the Landlord of possession of the Premise, for which this lease or a true and correct copy thereof shall be his sufficient warrant, whereupon, if the Landlord so desires, a writ of possession may issue forthwith, without any prior writ or proceedings whatsoever, and provided that if for any reason after such action shall have commenced the same 
     
 17   

shall be terminated and possession remain in or be restored to the Tenant, the Landlord shall have the right upon any subsequent default or defaults, or upon the termination or cancellation of this lease as hereinbefore set forth, to bring one or more amicable action or actions as hereinbefore set forth to recover possession as aforesaid.  
  (f)                                      Do whatever Tenant is obligated to do under this Lease and may enter the Premises without being liable to prosecution or any claim for damages therefore, to accomplish this purpose.  Tenant shall reimburse Landlord immediately upon demand for any expenses which Landlord incurs in thus effecting compliance with this Lease on Tenant s behalf, and Landlord shall not be liable for any damages suffered by Tenant from such action, unless caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or otherwise. 
     
   Section 24.03         No act or thing done by Landlord or its agents during the Term shall constitute an acceptance of an attempted surrender of the Premises, and no agreement to accept a surrender of the Premises or to terminate this Lease shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by Landlord.  No re-entry or taking possession of the Premises by Landlord shall constitute an election by Landlord to terminate this Lease, unless a written notice of such intention is given to Tenant. Notwithstanding any such re-letting or re-entry or taking possession, Landlord may at any time thereafter terminate this Lease for a previous default.  Landlord s acceptance of partial payment of Rental following an event of default hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver of such event of default.  No waiver by Landlord of any breach of this Lease shall constitute a waiver of any other violation or breach of any time of the terms hereof.  Forbearance by Landlord to enforce one or more of the remedies herein provided upon a breach hereof shall not constitute a waiver of any other breach of the Lease.
