NOTE 1   
       ORGANIZATION
    AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

Organization
and Nature of Business    

Code
Green Apparel Corp., formerly known as Gold Standard Mining Corp. (the   Company  ) was incorporated in Nevada
on December 11, 2007 as Fluid Solutions, Inc. On May 6, 2009, Fluid Solutions, Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
of Gold Standard Mining Corp., a Wyoming corporation (  GS Wyoming  ), in exchange for 100,669,998 shares of
its common stock pursuant to an Exchange Agreement dated May 6, 2009 with that corporation and its shareholders. Concurrently
with the acquisition, Pantelis Zachos, its Chief Executive Officer and a director, tendered 59,400,000 shares of common stock
back to Fluid Solutions, Inc. for retirement.  

On
May 18, 2009, Fluid Solutions, Inc. changed its name to   Gold Standard Mining Corp.   and effected a 3.3 to
1 forward stock split. This split has been retroactively reflected in these financial statements.  

As
of the date that the Company acquired GS Wyoming, GS Wyoming s principal asset was rights under an Exchange Agreement, dated
February 9, 2009, pursuant to which GS Wyoming had agreed to acquire Rosszoloto Co. Ltd., a limited liability company organized
under the laws of Russia (  Rosszoloto  ), in a stock exchange. Rosszoloto is engaged in the business of gold
mining in the Amur region of Russia near the border between Russia and China. The Company completed the acquisition of Rosszoloto
in June 2010. The Company issued a total of 100,669,998 shares of common stock to the shareholders of GS Wyoming.  

In
the spring of 2011, during the course of preparation of financial statements of the Company, the Board of Directors concluded
that the Company could not get the financial information regarding Rosszoloto necessary for the financial statements of the Company,
including Rosszoloto, to be audited. Based on this, in May 2011, the Company rescinded the acquisition of Rosszoloto and has treated
the transaction as never having occurred. In connection with such rescission, the Company received back 51,499,998 shares of its
common stock that were issued to acquire GS Wyoming.  

On
July 17, 2012, Gold Standard Mining Corp. changed its name to   J.D. Hutt Corporation   as it sought to engage
in opportunities outside of mining and natural resource exploration. From that time, and for a period of nearly two years, the
Company s operations consisted of seeking other opportunities. On April 26, 2014, and with the appointment of George Powell
as its CEO and Director, the Company officially changed its business model to offer eco-friendly corporate apparel primarily constructed
from recycled textiles. To better reflect the Company s change in business direction, the Company officially changed its
name to   Code Green Apparel Corp.   on May 15, 2015.  

The
Company is a publicly held Nevada corporation, whose common stock trades on the OTC Market Group, Inc. s Pink Sheets under
the trading symbol,   CGAC.    

Basis
of Presentation and Going Concern    

The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (  GAAP  ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP
for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to the financial statements
and footnotes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

The
Company has generated only limited revenues from operations since inception. Since inception, it has incurred
significant losses to date, and as of September 30, 2016, has a working capital deficit of approximately $1,800,000, and an
accumulated deficit of approximately $12,800,000. The Company s ability to continue its operations is uncertain and is
dependent upon its ability to implement a business plan sufficient to generate a positive cash flow and/or raise capital to
fund its operations.  

5  

These
financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities that might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue operations in the normal course of business.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and timing of revenues and expenses,
the reported amounts and classification of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These
estimates and assumptions are based on the Company s historical results as well as management s future expectations.
The Company s actual results could vary materially from management s estimates and assumptions. Additionally, interim
results may not be indicative of the Company s results for future interim periods, or the Company s annual results.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand and cash in time deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments
with original maturities of three months or less.  

Inventories    

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. The Company periodically reviews its inventories for indications
of slow movement and obsolescence and records an allowance when it is deemed necessary.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company recognizes gross sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title transfer has occurred, the price is fixed
or readily determinable, and collection is probable. It recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605 ).  

Stock
Based Compensation    

The
Company from time to time issues shares of common stock for services. These issuances have been valued at the estimated fair market
value of the services since its stock is thinly traded and the Company has raised minimal cash from sales of stock.  

Disclosure
About Fair Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company estimates that the fair value of all financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 do not differ materially
from the aggregate carrying values of its financial instruments recorded in the accompanying condensed balance sheets. The estimated
fair value amounts have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value, and accordingly, the estimates
are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange.  

Derivative
Financial Instruments    

The
Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify
as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument
is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported
in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing
model to value the derivative instruments. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should
be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are
classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument
could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.  

6  

The
Company has determined that certain convertible debt instruments outstanding as of the date of these financial statements include
an exercise price   reset   adjustment that qualifies as derivative financial instruments under the provisions
of ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in an Entity s Own Stock (  ASC 815-40  ). Certain of
the convertible debentures have a variable exercise price, thus are convertible into an indeterminate number of shares for which
we cannot determine if we have sufficient authorized shares to settle the transaction with. Accordingly, the embedded conversion
option is a derivative liability and is marked to market through earnings at the end of each reporting period. Any change in fair
value during the period recorded in earnings as   Other income (expense) - gain (loss) on change in derivative liabilities.    

Net
Income (Loss) Per Share    

Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur
if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Any anti-dilutive effects
on net income (loss) per share are excluded. The Company has no potentially dilutive securities outstanding at September 30,
2016.  

Income
Taxes    

Provisions
for income taxes are based on taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes on temporary differences between
the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income and between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported
amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the financial statements at currently
enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized
or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision
for income taxes.  

In
assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation
of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences such as loss carry-forwards and tax credits become
deductible. Management considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment and ensuring
that the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is adjusted as appropriate.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires, among other things, that entities measure equity investments
(except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) at fair
value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Under the standard, entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized
holding gains and losses on equity securities classified today as available for sale as a component of other comprehensive income.
For equity investments without readily determinable fair values the cost method of accounting is also eliminated, however subject
to certain exceptions, entities will be able to elect to record equity investments without readily determinable fair values at
cost, less impairment and plus or minus adjustments for observable price changes, with all such changes recognized in earnings.
This new standard does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans. The standard
is effective for us on July 1, 2018 (the first quarter of our 2019 fiscal year). The Company is currently evaluating the anticipated
impact of this standard on our financial statements.  

7  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations
by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
Topic 842 affects any entity that enters into a lease, with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in this Update supersedes
Topic 840, Leases. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from
leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability)
and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For public companies, the amendments
in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  that clarifies how to apply revenue recognition guidance related to whether an entity
is a principal or an agent. ASU 2016-08 clarifies that the analysis must focus on whether the entity has control of the goods
or services before they are transferred to the customer and provides additional guidance about how to apply the control principle
when services are provided and when goods or services are combined with other goods or services. The effective date for ASU 2016-08
is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09   as amended by
ASU 2015-14 ,  for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods  within those years.  The Company has not yet determined the impact
of  ASU 2016-08 on its  consolidated  financial
statements.   

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation, or ASU No. 2016-09. The areas for simplification
in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities,
the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim
period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity
that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess
tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using
a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period
in which the guidance is adopted. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows
when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments
requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating
expected term should be applied prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess
tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method.
We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing , which provides further guidance on identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability
of licensing implementation guidance. The effective date for ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09 as amended
by ASU 2015-14 ,  for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods  within those years.  The Company has not yet determined the impact
of  ASU 2016-10 on its  consolidated  financial
statements.

until or unless there is an event of default. The note matures on December 3, 2016. The holder has the option to convert any
balance of principal into common stock of the Company. The rate of conversion for the note is calculated as the lowest of the
10 trading closing prices immediately preceding such conversion, discounted by 32.5%. The balance of this note was $175,000
as of September 30, 2016. The beneficial conversion feature has a value of $212,500 at September 30, 2016.  

On
June 15, 2016, the Company secured $105,500 from the sale of a convertible promissory note, which contained a $15,825
original issue discount, bringing the principal amount of the note to $121,325. The note bears interest at 12% per annum. The
note matures on June 15, 2017. The holder has the option to convert any balance of principal into common stock of the Company
after the initial 180 days. The rate of conversion for this note is calculated as the average of the three lowest closing
prices of the Company s common stock during the 20 trading days immediately preceding such conversion, discounted by
50%. The outstanding balance of this note was $76,132 as of September 30, 2016. The beneficial conversion feature has a value

On
September 23, 2016, the Company secured $55,500 from the sale of a convertible promissory note, which contained an
$8,325 original issue discount, bringing the principal amount of the note to $63,825. The note bears interest at 12% per
annum. The note matures on September 23, 2017. The holder has the option to convert any balance of principal into common
stock of the Company after the initial 180 days. The rate of conversion for this note is calculated as the average of the
three lowest closing prices of the Company s common stock during the 20 trading days immediately preceding such
conversion, discounted by 50%. The outstanding balance of this note was $49,119 as of September 30, 2016. The beneficial
conversion feature has a value of $106,250 at September 30, 2016.  

Due
to the variable conversion price associated with these convertible promissory notes, the Company has determined that the conversion
feature is considered a derivative liability. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company
record the fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date of the Convertible Promissory Note and to adjust the fair value
as of each subsequent balance sheet date.  

The
initial fair values of the embedded debt derivatives of $500,842, $227,746, $322,660 and $108,458 were charged to current period
operations as interest expenses. The fair value of the described embedded derivative was determined using the Black-Scholes Model
with the following assumptions:  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a loss in fair value of derivative of $136,960.  

The
following table represents the Company s derivative liability activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

NOTE 4   
       Derivative
    financial instruments    

The
following table presents the components of the Company s derivative financial instruments associated with convertible
promissory notes (See Note 3) which have no observable market data and are derived using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model measured at fair value on a recurring basis, using Level 1 and 3 inputs to the fair value hierarchy, at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015:  

These derivative financial instruments arise as a result of applying  ASC 815 Derivative and Hedging  (  ASC 815  ),
which requires the Company to make a determination whether an equity-linked financial instrument, or embedded feature, is indexed
to the entity s own stock. This guidance applies to any freestanding financial instrument or embedded features that have
the characteristics of a derivative, and to any freestanding financial instruments that are potentially settled in an entity s
own stock.  

10  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding notes with embedded conversion features and the Company
did not, at this date, have a sufficient number of authorized and available shares of common stock to settle the outstanding contracts
which triggered the requirement to account for these instruments as derivative financial instruments until such time as the Company
has sufficient authorized shares.

privilege of preferred stock has been recorded as a dividend in the current period and an increase in additional paid-in
capital.  

NOTE 7   
       GOING CONCERN    

The
accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company
has had only limited revenues since inception. Since inception, it has incurred significant losses to date, and as of
September 30, 2016, has a working capital deficit of approximately $1,800,000 and has an accumulated deficit of
approximately $12,800,000. The Company s ability to continue its operations is uncertain and is dependent upon its
ability to implement a business plan sufficient to generate a positive cash flow and/or raise capital to fund its operations.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue operations in the normal course of business.  

NOTE 8   
       ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT    

Effective
on June 23, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with 10Star LLC (  10Star   and the   Purchase
Agreement  ), pursuant to which, the Company purchased certain contracts, relating to 10Star s   On the
Border   and   7-Eleven   accounts (the   Purchased Accounts  ).  

12  

The
purchase price paid for the Assets at closing on June 23, 2016, was (a) $50,000 in cash; (b) 5 million shares of restricted
common stock; and (c) an unsecured promissory note in the amount of $200,000 (the   Promissory Note  ). The
total purchase price of $280,000 is presented on the current balance sheet as  Purchased contract  as of
September 30, 2016, net of $30,000 of accumulated amortization.  

The
parties agreed to certain post-closing requirements in connection with the Acquisition. We agreed that Chase Daniel, the
Chief Executive Officer and majority owner of 10Star, would be invited to serve as a member of the Company s Board of
Directors, subject to the Board of Directors confirming his qualifications, for a period of not less than one (1) year from
the closing, which appointment was effective on June 23, 2016. The Company agreed to provide Mr. Daniel, upon payment in full
of the Promissory Note, a commission equal to 3% of all net sales (gross sales generated by us, less (i) returns,
(ii) discounts, (iii) adjustments, and (iv) allowances) shipped by us (and paid for by customers), relating to the
Purchased Accounts, payable monthly in arrears. The Company agreed to keep complete and accurate books and records showing
all net sales with respect to the Purchased Accounts and to allow Mr. Daniel audit and inspection rights in connection
therewith. In the event any audit reveals a shortfall, we are required to immediately pay such shortfall, with any amount not
immediately paid accruing interest at the rate of 15% per annum until paid, and we are required to reimburse Mr. Daniel for
the cost of such audit in the event any shortfall is greater than 5% of the amount of commissions paid in the prior 12
months.  

Amounts
due under the Promissory Note accrue interest at the rate of 10% per annum (12% upon the occurrence of an event of default),
with all interest payable on the maturity date of the Promissory Note, June 23, 2018, provided that the amounts owed under
the Promissory Note can be pre-paid in whole or part at any time prior to maturity. Until the earlier of (a) the maturity
date of the Promissory Note; and (b) the date the Promissory Note is paid in full, the Company is required to pay 10Star
fifty percent (50%) of the Gross Profits generated by the Company in connection with the Purchased Accounts.  

NOTE 9   
       EMPLOYMENT
    AGREEMENTS    

In
connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into executive employment agreements with Aaron Luna and
William Joseph (J.B.) Hill, to serve as Executive Vice Presidents of the Company in May 2016, in anticipation of
the Acquisition.  

The
employment agreements with Aaron Luna and William Joseph (J.B.) Hill, as Executive Vice Presidents of the Company, entered into
with such executives at closing, each have substantially similar terms, including an effective date of April 1, 2016, an initial
term of one year (automatically renewable thereafter for additional one year terms in the event neither party provides the other
notice of non-renewal at least 30 days prior to the end of the then term). Both agreements include a base salary as determined
by the Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion in addition to an equity consideration of 3.75 million restricted
shares of common stock to Mr. Luna and 3.25 million restricted shares of common stock to Mr. Hill (the   Restricted Shares  ),
which Restricted Shares are subject to forfeiture and cancellation until March 31, 2017, pursuant to Restricted Stock Award Agreements,
which provide that if the executive s employment is terminated due to death, the end of the term of the employment agreement,
for cause, or by the executive for any reason other than good reason (as defined in the agreements), the vesting of the Restricted
Shares ceases on the date of termination and any unvested Restricted Shares are forfeited, provided that if the executive s
employment is terminated by us without cause or by the executive for good reason, any Restricted Shares that are scheduled to
vest during the period through the end of the initial term or the then current extension term, if any, vest immediately. In addition
to the base salary described above, the executives receive a commission on our net sales (gross sales less (i) returns, (ii) discounts,
(iii) adjustments, (iv) allowances, and (v) any and all payments made to 10Star in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement)(  Net
Sales  ), to accounts other than the Purchased Accounts, determined on a case-by-case basis in the reasonable discretion
of the Company; and a commission equal to 1.50% of all Net Sales shipped by us (and paid by customers), for the Purchased Accounts,

Recent
Transactions:   

On
June 15, 2016,  we  sold Carebourn Capital, L.P. (  Carebourn  ) a
Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $121,325, representing $105,500 borrowed from Carebourn and an original
issue discount of $15,825 (the  June 2016  Carebourn Convertible Note  ), pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement,
dated June 15, 2016. The Carebourn Convertible Note bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum (22% upon an event of default)
and is due and payable on June 15, 2017.  

On
May 1, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Anubis Capital Partners ( Anubis ), a business advisor. The
agreement calls for monthly payments of $2,500 in service fees along with the issuance of a $500,000 fully earned convertible
debt that accrues interest at 8% per annum. During December 2015, the Company issued 25,000,000 shares of common stock in payment
of $212,500 of principal on this convertible debt. On July 12, 2016, the Company entered into a Compromise and Settlement Agreement
(the  Settlement ) with Anubis, whereby Anubis agreed to accept the sum of $35,000 (which is in addition to $30,000

In
September 2016, we entered into a factoring agreement, whereby we sold $14,590 in accounts receivable for $10,000.  

On
September 23, 2016,  we  sold Carebourn a Convertible Promissory Note in the principal
amount of $63,825, representing $55,000 borrowed from Carebourn and an original issue discount of $8,325 (the  September
2016  Carebourn Convertible Note  , and together with the June 2016 Carebourn Convertible Note, the  Carebourn
Convertible Notes ), pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated September 23, 2016. The September 2016 Carebourn
Convertible Note bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum (22% upon an event of default) and is due and payable on September
23, 2017.  

The
principal amount of the Carebourn Convertible Notes and all accrued interest is convertible at the option of the holder thereof
into our common stock at any time following the 180th day after the applicable Carebourn Convertible Note was issued. The conversion
price of the Carebourn Convertible Notes is equal to 50% of the average of the lowest three trading prices of our common stock
for the 20 trading days prior to the conversion date. At no time could the Carebourn Convertible Notes be converted into shares
of our common stock if such conversion would have resulted in Carebourn and its affiliates owning an aggregate of in excess of
4.99% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, subject to the waiver of such limitation by Carebourn with at least
61 days prior written notice.  

The
Carebourn Convertible Notes provide for customary events of default and contain customary positive and negative covenants. Additionally,
upon the occurrence of certain fundamental defaults, as described in the Carebourn Convertible Notes, we are required to pay Carebourn
liquidated damages in addition to the amount owed under the Carebourn Convertible Notes.  

We
have the right to prepay in full the unpaid principal and interest on the Carebourn Convertible Notes, upon notice, any time prior
to the 364 th  day after the issuance date of the applicable note, subject to payment of a prepayment amount ranging
from 130% to 150% of the then outstanding balance on the Carebourn Convertible Notes (inclusive of accrued and unpaid interest
and any default amounts then owing), depending on when such prepayment is made.  

15  

We
paid $10,000 in fees to a related party of Carebourn s and $1,000 in attorney s fees in connection with the sale of
the Carebourn Convertible Notes.  

In
the event that the Carebourn Convertible Notes are not repaid in cash in their entirety, Company shareholders may suffer dilution
if and to the extent that the balance of the Carebourn Convertible Notes are converted into common stock.  

Plan
of Operations   

We
have commenced shipping products to several customers, including On the Border Restaurants, 7 Eleven, Frisco Rivet and numerous
specialty based accounts. We are also working diligently to finalize programs with numerous other accounts. Notwithstanding the
above, we believe we need $1.2 million of additional funding for production in the near term and for our operations for the next
12 months and $2.5 million for our operations over the next 24 months, as described below. We plan to raise funding subsequent
to the date of this report through the sale of debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. We require
additional funding to (a) fund production on new programs that are coming on line; (b) fund additional sales and marketing programs
to enhance revenue growth; (c) fund development of and warehouse inventory for an E-Commerce site; (d) fund synergistic acquisitions;
and (e) to bridge operational working capital until such time, if ever, as we can generate sufficient revenues to support our
expenses. If we are unable to access additional capital moving forward, it will hurt our ability to grow and to generate future
revenues. We may not be able to increase sales or obtain additional financing, if necessary, at a level to meet our current obligations
to continue as a going concern.  

Results
of Operations   

Three
months ended September 30, 2016 versus the three months ended September 30, 2015

or 56% decrease from $338,620 of selling, general and administrative expenses incurred during the three months ended September
30, 2015, for the reasons described below. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of expenses the Company incurs
during day-to-day operations.  

During

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $21,899 of legal, accounting and professional expense, which are
included under selling, general and administrative expenses, which is a $150,114 decrease from the $172,013 incurred during the
three months ended September 30, 2015. Legal, accounting and professional expense relates to the Company s registration
statement and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The main reason for the decrease in professional fees
was the cost of the preparation of the Company s Form S-1 registration statement during the prior period.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $2,610 of product development expenses, which are included under
selling, general and administrative expenses, which is an $88,404 decrease compared to the $91,014 incurred during the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The product development costs relate to the development of products within the corporate logo wear industry
made from sustainable textiles, and were higher in the prior period as the Company was just starting its operations during that
period. Over time we anticipate product development expenses leveling out, provided that as we get requests for products from
new clients we will see spikes in our development costs as each customer will want specific items developed for their specific
needs. We will likely experience ups and downs with regards to product development costs for these specific reasons in the foreseeable
future.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $6,012 of travel expenses, which are included under selling, general
and administrative expenses, which is a $37,846 decrease from the $43,858 incurred during the three months ended September 30,
2015. Travel expenses relate to the efforts by management to meet with new customers and potential customers and vary from period-to-period.
Over time the Company expects to see a leveling off of these costs; however, as the Company grows the Company anticipates these
expenses increasing.  

Other
income (expense)   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported $34,607 of interest expense compared to $10,082 reported during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The interest expense relates to promissory notes outstanding as described in greater
detail in Note 2 and 3 to the financial statements included herein.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a gain in the amount of $456,744 as a result of the initial
valuation and revaluation of the derivative liabilities (see Note 4 of the financial statements included herein). During the three
months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized a loss in the amount of $3,188 as a result of the revaluation of the derivative
liability.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized additional derivative gain in the amount of $905,980 related
to the derivative created due to having an insufficient number of shares of common stock available for conversion of outstanding
convertible notes in the event such convertible notes are converted in full.  

17  

Net income (loss)    

The Company had net
income for three months ended September 30, 2016, of $1,215,203, a $1,567,093 increase from the $351,890 net loss incurred during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net income was primarily due to the change in fair value of derivative
and derivative liability gain, both of which were non-cash items.

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $32,854 of product development expenses, which are included under selling, general

time we anticipate product development expenses leveling out, provided that as we get requests for products from new clients we
anticipate our development costs spiking, as each customer will want specific items developed for their specific needs. We will
likely experience ups and downs with regards to product development costs for these specific reasons in the foreseeable future. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $81,310 of travel expenses, which are included under selling, general and administrative
expenses, which is a $13,594 decrease from the $94,904 incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Travel expenses
relate to the efforts by management to meet with new customers and potential customers and vary from period-to-period. Over time
the Company expects to see a leveling off of these costs; however, as the Company grows the Company anticipates these expenses
increasing. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $117,000 of non-cash compensation related to the stock issuance to the Company s
CEO, the Company s COO, a consultant and in accordance with certain employment agreements described in greater detail in
Note 8 to the financial statements included herein, which is included under selling, general and administrative expenses. During

to the Company s CEO. 

Other income (expense)    

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported $66,526 of interest expense compared to $34,908 reported during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The interest expense relates to the promissory notes outstanding as described in greater detail in Note
2 and 3 to the financial statements included herein. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a loss in the amount of $136,960 as a result of the initial valuation and revaluation
of the derivative liabilities (see Note 4 of the financial statements included herein). During the nine months ended September
30, 2015, the Company recognized a loss in the amount of $917,151 as a result of the revaluation of the derivative liability. 

On
January 4, 2016, the Company sold 25,000 shares of its restricted Series B Preferred Stock to Dr. Scheffey in connection with the
Subscription Agreement as dated December 7, 2015 (with a January 1, 2016 payment) and received $250,000. The intrinsic value, the
difference between the subscription price and the underlying price of the common stock on the date of the subscription agreement,
has been valued at $250,000. Accordingly, this discount attributable to the beneficial conversion privilege of the preferred stock
has been recorded as an expense in the current period loss and an increase in additional paid-in capital. 

Net loss    

The Company had a
net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,163,406, a $1,142,605 decrease from the net loss of $1,806,011 incurred
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to the reasons described above.   

Liquidity and capital resources    

The Company had an
accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016 of approximately $12.8 million. The Company incurred a loss of $1,163,406 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and has negative working capital of $1,816,684 as of September 30, 2016. The Company s
continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely
basis, to obtain additional financing or refinancing as may be required and, ultimately, to attain profitable operations. Management s
plans to eliminate the going concern situation include, but are not limited to, the raise of additional capital through issuance
of debt and equity, improved cash flow management. Failure to raise additional capital or improve its performance in the next 12
months will cause the Company to significantly curtail its business activities and expansion plans within the next twelve months. 

The Company has $5,472
in cash as of September 30, 2016 compared to $32,205 as of December 31, 2015 as a result of stock subscriptions and convertible
debentures sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

We had $467,148 of
total assets as of September 30, 2016, consisting of cash of $5,472, accounts receivable of $128,323, inventory of $69,552, fixed
assets, net of $13,801 and goodwill related to the purchase of the assets of 10Star during the period of $250,000. 

We had total liabilities
of $2,220,031 as of September 30, 2016, including accounts payable and accrued expenses of $283,292, accrued interest on our convertible
notes of $100,299, notes payable of $291,645, convertible notes, net of discount, of $583,367 and derivative liability of $961,428. 

Our outstanding promissory
notes, convertible notes and derivative liability are described in greater detail in Notes 2, 3 and 4, to the financial statements
attached herein. 

Cash Flows  

Operating Activities  

Net cash used by operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly due to a net loss of $1,163,406, offset by loss on derivative
revaluation of $136,960, $250,000 of discount attributable to beneficial conversion privilege of preferred stock and non-cash compensation
of $117,000. 

Investing Activities    

Net cash used by investing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was solely due to the purchase of fixed assets of $14,534. 

Financing Activities  

Net cash provided by
financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was from the sale of Series B Preferred Stock of $250,000 and
$234,350 from net proceeds of notes payable offset by $32,127 of repayments. 

From time to time,
we may attempt to raise capital through either equity or debt offerings. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors,
including, among other things, the rate at which our business grows, with corresponding demands for working capital and expansion
capacity. We could be required, or may elect, to seek additional funding through public or private equity, debt financing or bank
financing. 

Critical Estimates and Judgments    

The preparation of
the Company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to receivables and accrued expenses.
Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable
based on the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most
significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company s financial statements include estimates as
to the appropriate carrying value of the Company s intangible assets, the amount of stock compensation, and the amount of
accrued liabilities that are not readily attainable from other sources. These accounting policies are described at relevant sections
in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.   

The discussion in this
report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company s future actual results may
differ materially from the results discussed herein, including those in the forward-looking statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk  

Pursuant to Item 305(e)
of Regulation S-K (  229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a
  smaller reporting company,   as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

We have established
and maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange, is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Interim Chief Financial Officer (CFO), to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Management, with the
participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered
by this report. As of September 30, 2016, based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of
the reasons described below, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures   were not effective
to   provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the Commission
pursuant to the Exchange Act, is recorded properly, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO
and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Management has identified
the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as of September 30, 2016: 

i)           Lack
of segregation of duties . At this time, our resources and size prevent us from being able to employ sufficient resources to
enable us to have adequate segregation of duties within our internal control system. Management will periodically reevaluate this
situation. 

ii)          Lack
of an independent audit committee . Although the Board of Directors serves as an audit committee, it is not comprised solely
of independent directors. We may establish an audit committee comprised solely of independent directors when we have sufficient
capital resources and working capital to attract qualified independent directors and to maintain such a committee. 

iii)         Insufficient
number of independent directors . At the present time, our Board of Directors does not consist of a majority of independent
directors, a factor that is counter to corporate governance practices as set forth by the rules of various stock exchanges. 

Due to a lack of financial
resources, we are not able to, and do not intend to, immediately take any action to remediate these material weaknesses. We will
not be able to do so until we acquire sufficient financing to do so. We will implement further controls as circumstances, cash
flow, and working capital permit. Notwithstanding the assessment that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
and that there were material weaknesses as identified in this report, we believe that our financial statements fairly present our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods covered thereby in all material respects. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, including any corrective actions
with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.  

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

Although we may, from
time to time, be involved in litigation and claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business, we are not currently
a party to any material legal proceeding. In addition, we are not aware of any material legal or governmental proceedings against
us, or contemplated to be brought against us. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

There have been no
material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1/A, filed
with the Commission on April 20, 2016, other than as disclosed below, and investors are encouraged to review such risk factors
below and in the Form S-1/A, prior to making an investment in the Company. 

We
have various outstanding convertible notes which are convertible into shares of our common stock at a discount to market.    

As
described above under  Note 3   Convertible Notes  to the financial statements included herein, we currently
have various outstanding convertible promissory notes. The conversion prices of the convertible notes provide for conversion of
amounts owed at a 50% discount to the market value of our common stock. As a result, any conversion of the convertible notes and
sale of shares of common stock issuable in connection with the conversion thereof will likely cause the value of our common stock,
if any, to decline in value, as described in greater detail under the Risk Factors below.   

The
issuance and sale of common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes may depress the market price of our common stock.    

If
sequential conversions of the convertible notes and sales of such converted shares take place, the price of our common stock may
decline, and as a result, the holders of the convertible notes will be entitled to receive an increasing number of shares in connection
with conversions, which shares could then be sold in the market, triggering further price declines and conversions for even larger
numbers of shares, to the detriment of our investors. The shares of common stock which the convertible notes are convertible into
may be sold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144. As a result, the sale of these shares may adversely affect the market price,
if any, of our common stock.  

In
addition, the common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes may represent overhang that may also adversely affect
the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company s stock in the market
than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of the company s stock will decrease, and any additional
shares which shareholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. The convertible notes will
be convertible into shares of our common stock at a discount to market as described above, and such discount to market provides
the holders with the ability to sell their common stock at or below market and still make a profit. In the event of such
overhang, the note holders will have an incentive to sell their common stock as quickly as possible. If the share volume of our
common stock cannot absorb the discounted shares, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease.      

The
issuance of common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes will cause immediate and substantial dilution.    

The
issuance of common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests
of other stockholders since the holders of the convertible notes may ultimately receive and sell the full amount of shares issuable
in connection with the conversion of such convertible notes. Although certain of the convertible notes may not be converted if
such conversion would cause the holders thereof to own more than 4.99% of our outstanding common stock, this restriction does not
prevent the holders of the convertible notes subject to such restrictions from converting some of their holdings, selling those
shares, and then converting the rest of its holdings, while still staying below the 4.99% limit. In this way, the holders of the
convertible notes could sell more than any applicable ownership limit while never actually holding more shares than the applicable
limits allow. If the holders of the convertible notes choose to do this, it will cause substantial dilution to the then holders
of our common stock. Notwithstanding the above, we plan to repay the convertible notes in full before any conversions take place.  

The
continuously adjustable conversion price feature of the convertible notes could require us to issue a substantially greater number
of shares, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause dilution to our existing stockholders.    

Our
existing stockholders will experience substantial dilution of their investment upon any conversion of the convertible notes. The
convertible notes are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to a discount to the market value of
our common stock as described above. As a result, the number of shares issuable could prove to be significantly greater in the
event of a decrease in the trading price of our common stock, which decrease would cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.
As sequential conversions and sales take place, the price of our common stock may decline, and if so, the holders of the convertible
notes would be entitled to receive an increasing number of shares, which could then be sold, triggering further price declines
and conversions for even larger numbers of shares, which would cause additional dilution to our existing stockholders and would
likely cause the value of our common stock to decline.  

The
continuously adjustable conversion price feature of our convertible notes may encourage the holders of the convertible notes to
sell short our common stock, which could have a depressive effect on the price of our common stock.    

The
convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a discount to the market value of our common stock. The significant
downward pressure on the price of our common stock as the holders of the convertible notes convert and sell material amounts of
our common stock could encourage investors to short sell our common stock. This could place further downward pressure on the price
of our common stock. In addition, not only the sale of shares issued upon conversion of the convertible notes, but also the mere
perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.   

We have established
preferred stock which can be designated by the Board of Directors without shareholder approval and have established Series A Preferred
Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, which give the holders thereof voting (Series A and B), liquidation rights (Series B) and the
ability to convert such shares into our common stock (Series B).   

We have 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock authorized, which includes 1,000 shares of designated Series A Preferred Stock of which 1,000 shares
are issued and outstanding as of the date of this filing and 200,000 designated shares of Series B Preferred Stock, of which 65,000
are outstanding as of the date of this filing. The Series A Preferred Stock provide the holder thereof the power to vote on all
shareholder matters (including, but not limited to at every meeting of the stockholders of the Company and upon any action taken
by stockholders of the Company with or without a meeting) equal to fifty-one percent (51%) of the total vote. The Series B Preferred
Stock have an original issue price and liquidation preference (pro rata with the common stock) of $10.00 per share. The Series
B Preferred Stock provides the holders thereof the right to convert such shares of Series B Preferred Stock into common stock on
a 100-for-one basis, provided that no conversion can result in the conversion of more than that number of shares of Series B Preferred
Stock, if any, such that, upon such conversion, the aggregate beneficial ownership of the Company s common stock of any such
holder and all persons affiliated with any such holder as described in Rule 13d-3 is more than 4.99% of the Company s common
stock then outstanding. As a result, if we were to dissolve, liquidate or sell our assets, the holders of our Series B Preferred
Stock would have the right to receive pro rata with our common stock holders of $650,000 in proceeds from any such transaction,
after the payment of amounts owed to certain other of our creditors. The payment of the liquidation preferences could result in
common stock shareholders receiving less consideration if we were to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, either voluntarily or involuntarily.
Additionally, the existence of the liquidation preference may reduce the value of our common stock, make it harder for us to sell
shares of common stock in offerings in the future, or prevent or delay a change of control. Furthermore, the conversion of Series
B Preferred Stock may cause substantial dilution to our common shareholders. Additionally, while the Series A Preferred Stock are
outstanding, the holders of our common stock will have little to no say in corporate matters, and subject to applicable law, the
holders of our Series A Preferred Stock will exercise significant control in determining the appointment of directors and subsequently,
the outcome of corporate transactions or other matters concerning the Company, including the appointment of officers. The interests
of the holder of the Series A Preferred Stock, currently Mr. Powell, our CEO, may differ from the interests of the Company and
the Company s other stockholders. The voting rights provided to Mr. Powell pursuant to the Series A Preferred Stock may be
viewed negatively by investors and the marketplace and may cause the value of our shares to decline in value and/or be worth less
than similarly situated companies which do not have similar voting arrangements in place. Because our Board of Directors is entitled
to designate the powers and preferences of the preferred stock without a vote of our shareholders, our shareholders will have no
control over what designations and preferences our future preferred stock, if any, will have. 

The issuance
of common stock upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock will cause immediate and substantial dilution to existing shareholders.   

The Series B Preferred
Stock is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at the holder s option on a 100-for-one basis. The issuance
of common stock upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests
of other stockholders since the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock may ultimately receive and sell the full amount of shares
issuable in connection with the conversion of such Series B Preferred Stock. Although the Series B Preferred Stock may not be converted
by holder if such conversion would cause the holder to own more than 4.99% of our outstanding common stock, this restriction does
not prevent such holder from converting some of his holdings, selling those shares, and then converting the rest of his holdings,
while still staying below the 4.99% limit. In this way, the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock could sell more than this limit
while never actually holding more shares than this limit allows. If the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock chooses to do this,
it will cause substantial dilution to the then holders of our common stock. 

The issuance
and sale of common stock upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock may depress the market price of our common stock.   

If conversions of the
Series B Preferred Stock and sales of such converted shares take place, the price of our common stock may decline. In addition,
the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock may represent overhang that may also adversely affect
the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company s stock in the market than
there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of the company s stock will decrease, and any additional shares
which shareholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common
stock cannot absorb converted shares sold by the Series B Preferred Stock holder, then the value of our common stock will likely
decrease. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities and Use of Proceeds  

On September 23, 2016,
we sold a $63,825 Convertible Promissory Note to Carebourn as described above under  Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Recent Transactions . 

We claim an exemption
from registration for the issuance pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act, since the
foregoing issuance did not involve a public offering, the recipient was an (a)  accredited investor  and/or (b) had
access to similar documentation and information as would be required in a Registration Statement under the Securities Act, the
recipient acquired the securities for investment only and not with a view towards, or for resale in connection with, the public
sale or distribution thereof. The securities were offered without any general solicitation by us or our representatives. No underwriters
or agents were involved in the foregoing issuance and we paid no underwriting discounts or commissions. The securities sold are
subject to transfer restrictions, and the certificates evidencing the securities contain an appropriate legend stating that such
securities have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold absent registration or pursuant to
an exemption therefrom. The securities were not registered under the Securities Act and such securities may not be offered or sold
in the United States absent registration or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

pursuant to which JPM agreed to accept $60,000 in full payment of a $275,000 outstanding promissory note originally issued on May
1, 2014, and accrued and unpaid interest thereon in the amount of $60,000, representing service fees due for various services provided
by JPM. 

On
September 23, 2016,  we  sold Carebourn a Convertible Promissory Note in
the principal amount of $63,825, representing $50,000 borrowed from Carebourn and an original issue discount of $13,825 (the   Carebourn
Convertible Note  ), pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated September 23, 2016. The Carebourn Convertible
Note bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum (22% upon an event of default) and is due and payable on September 23, 2017.   

The
principal amount of the Carebourn Convertible Note and all accrued interest is convertible at the option of the holder thereof
into our common stock at any time following the 180th day after the Carebourn Convertible Note was issued. The conversion price
of the Carebourn Convertible Note is equal to 50% of the average of the lowest three trading prices of our common stock for the
20 trading days prior to the conversion date. At no time could the Carebourn Convertible Note be converted into shares of our common
stock if such conversion would have resulted in Carebourn and its affiliates owning an aggregate of in excess of 4.99% of the then
outstanding shares of our common stock, subject to the waiver of such limitation by Carebourn with at least 61 days prior written
notice. 

The
Carebourn Convertible Note provides for customary events of default and contains customary positive and negative covenants. Additionally,
upon the occurrence of certain fundamental defaults, as described in the Carebourn Convertible Note, we are required to pay Carebourn
liquidated damages in addition to the amount owed under the Carebourn Convertible Note.   

We
had the right to prepay in full the unpaid principal and interest on the Carebourn Convertible Note, upon notice, any time prior
to the 364 th  day after the issuance date of the note, subject to payment of a prepayment amount ranging from 130%
to 150% of the then outstanding balance on the Carebourn Convertible Note (inclusive of accrued and unpaid interest and any default
amounts then owing), depending on when such prepayment is made.   

We
paid $5,000 in fees to a related party of Carebourn s and $500 in attorney s fees in connection with the sale of the
Carebourn Convertible Note. 

In
the event that the Carebourn Convertible Note is not repaid in cash in its entirety, Company shareholders may suffer dilution if
and to the extent that the balance of the Carebourn Convertible Note is converted into common stock.

specifically contemplated by this Agreement and as required under the 1933 Act and any applicable state securities laws, the Company
is not required to obtain any consent, authorization or order of, or make any filing or registration with, any court, governmental

SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to the SEC Documents, and none of the SEC Documents, at the time they were filed with the SEC,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
statements made in any such SEC Documents is, or has been, required to be amended or updated under applicable law (except for such
statements as have been amended or updated in subsequent filings prior the date hereof). As of their respective dates, the financial
statements of the Company included in the SEC Documents complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. Such financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, during the periods involved and
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as

case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). Except as set forth in the financial statements of the Company

a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 3(i) contains a complete list and summary description of any pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened proceeding against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without regard to whether it would
have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are unaware of any facts or

by any person pertaining to, or proceeding pending, or to the Company s knowledge threatened, which challenges the right
of the Company or of a Subsidiary with respect to any Intellectual Property necessary to enable it to conduct its business as now
operated (and, as presently contemplated to be operated in the future); to the best of the Company s knowledge, the Company s
or its Subsidiaries  current and intended products, services and processes do not infringe on any Intellectual Property or
other rights held by any person; and the Company is unaware of any facts or circumstances which might give rise to any of the foregoing.

and has paid all taxes and other governmental assessments and charges that are material in amount, shown or determined to be due
on such returns, reports and declarations, except those being contested in good faith and has set aside on its books provisions
reasonably adequate for the payment of all taxes for periods subsequent to the periods to which such returns, reports or declarations

financial conditions, which, under applicable law, rule or regulation, requires public disclosure or announcement by the Company

after giving effect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, have the ability to, nor does it intend to take any action
that would impair its ability to, pay its debts from time to time incurred in connection therewith as such debts mature. The Company

Agent Instructions . Prior to registration of the Conversion Shares under the 1933 Act or the date on which the Conversion
Shares may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of Securities as of a particular date that can
then be immediately sold, all such certificates shall bear the restrictive legend specified in Section 2(g) of this Agreement.
The Company warrants that: (i) no stop transfer instructions to give effect to Section 2(f) hereof (in the case of the Conversion
Shares, prior to registration of the Conversion Shares under the 1933 Act or the date on which the Conversion Shares may be sold
pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of Securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately
sold), will be given by the Company to its transfer agent and that the Securities shall otherwise be freely transferable on the
books and records of the Company as and to the extent provided in this Agreement and the Note; (ii) it will not direct its transfer
agent not to transfer or delay, impair, and/or hinder its transfer agent in transferring (or issuing) (electronically or in certificated
form) any certificate for Conversion Shares to be issued to the Buyer upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to the Note as
and when required by the Note and this Agreement; and (iii) it will not fail to remove (or directs its transfer agent not to remove
or impairs, delays, and/or hinders its transfer agent from removing) any restrictive legend (or to withdraw any stop transfer
instructions in respect thereof) on any certificate for any Conversion Shares issued to the Buyer upon conversion of or otherwise
pursuant to the Note as and when required by the Note and this Agreement. Nothing in this Section shall affect in any way the
Buyer s obligations and agreement set forth in Section 2(g) hereof to comply with all applicable prospectus delivery requirements,
if any, upon re-sale of the Securities. If the Buyer provides the Company, at the cost of the Buyer, with (i) an opinion of counsel
in form, substance and scope customary for opinions in comparable transactions, to the effect that a public sale or transfer of
such Securities may be made without registration under the 1933 Act and such sale or transfer is effected or (ii) the Buyer provides
reasonable assurances that the Securities can be sold pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall permit the transfer, and, in the
case of the Conversion Shares, promptly instruct its transfer agent to issue one or more certificates, free from restrictive legend,
in such name and in such denominations as specified by the Buyer. The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations
hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Buyer, by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Accordingly, the Company acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Section may be inadequate
and agrees, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Company of the provisions of this Section, that the Buyer shall
be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach and requiring immediate transfer,
without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.

UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE,
SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES

CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE   

FOR VALUE RECEIVED,
Code Green Apparel Corporation  a  Nevada  corporation (hereinafter called the  Borrower ), hereby promises
to pay to the order of  CAREBOURN CAPITAL, L.P.,  a Delaware limited partnership, or registered assigns (the  Holder )
the sum of  $63,825.00  together with any interest as set forth herein, on  September 23, 2017  (the  Maturity
Date ), and to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance hereof at the rate of  12%  (The  Interest Rate )
per annum from the date hereof (the  Issue Date ) until the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or upon
acceleration or by prepayment or otherwise. This Note may not be prepaid in whole or in part except as otherwise explicitly set
forth herein. Any amount of principal or interest on this Note which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of twenty
two percent (22%) per annum from the due date thereof until the same is paid ( Default Interest ). Interest shall commence
accruing on the date that the Note is fully paid and shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of
days elapsed. All payments due hereunder (to the extent not converted into common stock,  $0.001  par value per share (the
 Common Stock ) in accordance with the terms hereof) shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America.
All payments shall be made at such address as the Holder shall hereafter give to the Borrower by written notice made in accordance
with the provisions of this Note. Whenever any amount expressed to be due by the terms of this Note is due on any day which is
not a business day, the same shall instead be due on the next succeeding day which is a business day and, in the case of any interest
payment date which is not the date on which this Note is paid in full, the extension of the due date thereof shall not be taken
into account for purposes of determining the amount of interest due on such date. As used in this Note, the term  business
day  shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which commercial banks in the city of New York, New York
are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed. Each capitalized term used herein, and not otherwise defined,
shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated the date hereof, pursuant to which
this Note was originally issued (the  Purchase Agreement ). 

This Note carries an
original issue discount of  $8,325.00  (the  OID ). In addition, the Borrower shall authorize the Holder, pursuant
to a disbursement memorandum dated on or around the Issue Date, to pay  $5,000.00  (the  Transactional Expense Amount )
to the Holder or the Holder s designee, to cover the Holder s accounting fees, due diligence fees, monitoring (including
but not limited to ACH monitoring costs), and/or other transactional costs incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of
the Note, as well as  $500.00  (the  Legal Fee ) to Holder s attorney, to cover Holder s legal review
fees in connection with the purchase and sale of the Note, all of which are included in the initial principal balance of this Note.
Thus, the purchase price of this Note shall be  $55,500.00,  computed as follows:  $63,825.00  initial principal balance
less the OID. Accordingly, the net amount to be received by the Company shall be  $50,000.00,  computed as follows: the purchase
price of  $55,500.00,  less the Transactional Expense Amount and Legal Fee. 

This Note is free from
all taxes, liens, claims and encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive rights or other
similar rights of shareholders of the Borrower and will not impose personal liability upon the holder thereof. 

The following terms shall apply to this
Note: 

ARTICLE I. CONVERSION RIGHTS 

1.1           Conversion Right .
The Holder shall have the right from time to time, and at any time following One Hundred and Eighty (180) days after the date of
this Note and ending on the later of: (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the date of payment of the Default Amount (as defined in Article
III) pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or Article III, each in respect of the remaining outstanding principal amount of this
Note to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of this Note into fully paid and non- assessable
shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the
Borrower into which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price (the  Conversion
Price ) determined as provided herein (a  Conversion ); provided, however, that in no event shall the Holder
be entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1)
the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which
may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted
portion of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained
herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which
the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more
than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial
ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act ), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso, provided, further, however,
that the limitations on conversion may be waived by the Holder upon, at the election of the Holder, not less than 61 days 
prior notice to the Borrower, and the provisions of the conversion limitation shall continue to apply until such 61st day (or such
later date, as determined by the Holder, as may be specified in such notice of waiver). The number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable
Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
 Notice of Conversion ), delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section 1.4 below; provided that
the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result
in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the  Conversion Date ).
The term  Conversion Amount  means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount
of this Note to be converted in such conversion plus (2) at the Holder s option, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on
such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date, plus (3) at the Holder s option,
Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or (2) plus (4) at the Holder s
option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g) hereof. 

1.2          Conversion
Price.  

Calculation of Conversion
Price . The conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) shall equal the Variable Conversion Price (as defined herein)
(subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Borrower relating to the Borrower s
securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary
distributions and similar events). The  Variable Conversion Price  shall mean  50%  multiplied by the Market Price
(as defined herein) (representing a discount rate of  50% ).  Market Price  means the average of the  lowest
three (3) Trading Prices  (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the  twenty (20)  Trading Day period ending on
the latest complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date.  Trading Price  means, for any security as of any date,
the lowest price on the OTC Markets OTCQB Marketplace, or applicable trading market (the  OTCQB ) as reported by a
reliable reporting service ( Reporting Service ) designated by the Holder (i.e. Bloomberg) or, if the OTCQB is not
the principal trading market for such security, the closing bid price of such security on the principal securities exchange or
trading market where such security is listed or traded or, if no closing bid price of such security is available in any of the
foregoing manners, the average of the closing bid prices of any market makers for such security that are listed in the  pink
sheets  by the National Quotation Bureau, Inc. If the Trading Price cannot be calculated for such security on such date in
the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the holders
of a majority in interest of the Notes being converted for which the calculation of the Trading Price is required in order to determine
the Conversion Price of such Notes.  Trading Day  shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any
period on the OTCQB, or on the principal securities exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being
traded. 

1.3          Authorized
Shares . The Borrower covenants that during the period the conversion right exists, the Borrower will reserve from its authorized
and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares, free from preemptive rights, to provide for the issuance of Common Stock
upon the full conversion of this Note issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Borrower is required at all times to have
authorized and reserved two and half times  (2.5)  the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion of
the Note (based on the Conversion Price of the Notes in effect from time to time)(the  Reserved Amount ). The Reserved
Amount shall be increased from time to time in accordance with the Borrower s obligations pursuant to Section 4(g) of the
Purchase Agreement. The Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
In addition, if the Borrower shall issue any securities or make any change to its capital structure which would change the number
of shares of Common Stock into which the Notes shall be convertible at the then current Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at
the same time make proper provision so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock authorized
and reserved, free from preemptive rights, for conversion of the outstanding Notes. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has
irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, and
(ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the
duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Note. 

If, at any time the Borrower
does not maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.2 of the Note. However, upon receipt
of written notice from the Holder of Borrower s failure to maintain the Reserved Amount, the Borrower shall have three (3)
days to cure any deficiencies in the Reserved Amount. 

1.4            Method of Conversion . 

(a)  Mechanics
of Conversion . Subject to Section 1.1, this Note may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to
time after  One Hundred and Eighty Days (180)  following the Issue Date, by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion
(by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York,
New York time) and (B) subject to Section 1.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower. 

(b)  Surrender
of Note Upon Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of this Note in accordance
with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid
principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the principal amount
so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower,
so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, such
records of the Borrower shall,  prima facie,  be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted as aforesaid, the Holder may not transfer this Note unless the Holder first
physically surrenders this Note to the Borrower, whereupon the Borrower will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the
Holder a new Note of like tenor, registered as the Holder (upon payment by the Holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may request,
representing in the aggregate the remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of
this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of a portion of this
Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note represented by this Note may be less than the amount stated on the
face hereof. 

(c)  Payment
of Taxes . The Borrower shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the
issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion of this Note in a name other than that
of the Holder (or in street name), and the Borrower shall not be required to issue or deliver any such shares or other securities
or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the Holder or the custodian in whose street name such shares are
to be held for the Holder s account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Borrower the amount of any such
tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been paid. 

(d)  Delivery
of Common Stock Upon Conversion . Upon receipt by the Borrower from the Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other
reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for conversion as provided in this Section
1.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for
the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within three (3) business days after such receipt (the  Deadline ) (and,
solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof, surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms
hereof and the Purchase Agreement. 

(e)  Obligation
of Borrower to Deliver Common Stock . Upon receipt by the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to
be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued
and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations
under this Article I, all rights with respect to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the
right to receive the Common Stock or other securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder
shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein, the Borrower s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates
for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same,
any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce
the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder of record, or any setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower,
and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection
with such conversion. The Conversion Date specified in the Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date so long as the Notice
of Conversion is received by the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time, on such date. 

(f)  Delivery
of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer . In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common Stock issuable
upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ) Fast Automated Securities
Transfer ( FAST ) program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions contained in Section 1.1
and in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit
Withdrawal Agent Commission ( DWAC ) system. 

(g)
 Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline . Without in any way limiting the Holder s right to pursue other remedies,
including actual damages and/or  equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline (other than a failure due to the circumstances described in Section 1.3 above, which
failure shall be governed by such Section) the Borrower shall pay to the Holder $1,500 per day in cash, for each day beyond the
Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock. Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the
month following the month in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first
day of the month following the month in which  it  has
accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with
the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms
of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure,
attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly the parties
acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 1.4(g) are justified. 

1.5           Concerning
the Shares . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred unless (i) such
shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall
have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel
in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption
from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 under the Act (or a successor rule) ( Rule
144 ) or (iv) such shares are transferred to an  affiliate  (as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees
to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section 1.5 and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined
in the Purchase Agreement). Except as otherwise provided in the Purchase Agreement (and subject to the removal provisions set forth
below), until such time as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note have been registered under the Act
or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that
can then be immediately sold, each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note that has not been
so included in an effective registration statement or that has not been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or
an exemption that permits removal of the legend, shall bear a legend substantially in the following form, as appropriate: 

NEITHER
THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE
HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT
BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED    (I)  IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL
SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS
SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION
WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES.     

The legend set forth
above shall be removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if (i)
the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel, in form, substance and scope customary for opinions
of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration
under the Act, which opinion shall be accepted by the Company so that the sale or transfer is effected or (ii) in the case of the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder under an effective registration
statement filed under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of securities
as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold. In the event that the Company does not accept the opinion of counsel
provided by the Buyer with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration, such as Rule 144 or
Regulation S, at the Deadline, it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Note. 

1.6          Effect of Certain
Events . 

(a)  Effect of Merger,
Consolidation, Etc . At the option of the Holder, the sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or series of related transactions in which more than 50% of
the voting power of the Borrower is disposed of, or the consolidation, merger or other business combination of the Borrower with
or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower is not the survivor shall either: (i) be deemed to be
an Event of Default (as defined in Article III) pursuant to which the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Holder upon the
consummation of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default Amount (as defined in Article  III)
 or (ii) be treated pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof.  Person  shall mean any individual, corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization. 

(b)  Adjustment Due
to Merger, Consolidation, Etc .  If,  at any time when this Note
is issued and outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the Notes, there shall be any merger, consolidation, or an exchange
of shares, recapitalization or reorganization pursuant to a merger or consolidation, or other similar event, as a result of which
shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of another class or classes
of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity, or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the
assets or more than 50% of the total outstanding shares of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete liquidation
of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note, upon the
basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore issuable
upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Holder would have been entitled  to
 receive in such transaction had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to
any limitations on conversion set forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the
rights and interests of the Holder of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions
for adjustment of the Conversion Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable,
as nearly as may be practicable in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The
Borrower shall not affect any transaction described in this Section 1.6(b) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable,
thirty (30) days prior written notice (but in any event at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice) of the record date of
the special meeting of shareholders to approve, or if there is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation,
exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall
be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written
instrument the obligations of this Section 1.6(b). The above provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers,
sales, transfers or share exchanges. 

(c)  Adjustment Due
to Distribution .  If  the Borrower shall declare
or make any distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase,
by way of return of capital or otherwise (including any dividend or distribution to the Borrower s shareholders in cash or
shares (or rights to acquire shares) of capital stock of a subsidiary (i.e., a spin-off)) (a  Distribution ), then
the Holder of this Note shall be entitled, upon any conversion of this Note after the date of record for determining shareholders
entitled to such Distribution, to receive the amount of such assets which would have been payable to the Holder with respect to
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion had such Holder been the holder of such shares of Common Stock on the
record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to such Distribution. 

(f)  Notice of Adjustments .
Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price as a result of the events described in this Section
1.6, the Borrower, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment and prepare and furnish to the Holder
of a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment
is based. The Borrower shall, upon the written request at any time of the Holder, furnish to such Holder a like certificate setting
forth (i) such adjustment or readjustment, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common
Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities or property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Note. 

1.7          Trading
Market Limitations . Unless permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of the principal securities market on which the
Common Stock is then listed or traded, in no event shall the Borrower issue upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Note
and the other Notes issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement more  than  the maximum number
of shares of Common Stock that the Borrower can issue pursuant to any rule of the principal United States securities market on
which the Common Stock is then traded (the  Maximum Share Amount ), which shall be 9.99% of the total shares outstanding
on the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), subject to equitable adjustment from time to time for stock splits,
stock dividends, combinations, capital reorganizations and similar events relating to the Common Stock occurring after the date
hereof. Once the Maximum Share Amount has been issued, if the Borrower fails to eliminate any prohibitions under applicable law
or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange, interdealer quotation system or other self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction
over the Borrower or any of its securities on the Borrower s ability  to issue shares of Common
Stock in excess of the Maximum Share Amount, in lieu of any further right to convert this Note, this will be considered an Event
of Default under Section 3.3 of the Note.   

1.8          Status
as Shareholder . Upon submission of a Notice of Conversion by a Holder, (i) the shares covered thereby (other than the shares,
if any, which cannot be issued because their issuance would exceed such Holder s allocated portion of the Reserved Amount
or Maximum Share Amount) shall be deemed converted into shares of Common Stock and (ii) the Holder s rights as a Holder of
such converted portion of this Note shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive certificates for such shares
of Common Stock and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in equity to such Holder because of a failure
by the Borrower to comply with the terms of this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder has not received certificates
for all shares of Common Stock prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the expiration of the Deadline with respect to a conversion
of any portion of this Note for any reason, then (unless the Holder otherwise elects to retain its status as a holder of Common
Stock by so notifying the Borrower) the Holder shall regain the rights of a Holder of this Note with respect to such unconverted
portions of this Note and the Borrower shall, as soon as practicable, return such unconverted Note to the Holder or, if the Note
has not been surrendered, adjust its records to reflect that such portion of this Note has not been converted. In all cases, the
Holder shall retain all of its rights and remedies (including, without limitation, (i) the right to receive Conversion Default
Payments pursuant to Section 1.3 to the extent required thereby for such Conversion Default and any subsequent Conversion Default
and (ii) the right to have the Conversion Price with respect to subsequent conversions determined in accordance with Section 1.3)
for the Borrower s failure to convert this Note. 

1.9
         Prepayment . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note, the Borrower may prepay the amounts outstanding
hereunder pursuant  to  the following terms and conditions, and subject to the Holder s
acceptance in Holder s sole discretion:   

(a)        At
any time during the period beginning on the Issue Date and ending on the date which is one hundred and eighty (180) days following
the Issue Date, the Borrower shall have the right, exercisable on not less than twenty (20) Trading Days prior written notice to
the Holder of the Note to prepay the outstanding Note (principal and accrued interest), in full by making a payment to the Holder
of an amount in cash equal to 130%, multiplied by the sum of: (w) the then outstanding principal amount of this Note plus (x) accrued
and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal amount of this Note plus (y) Default Interest. 

(b)        At
any time during the period beginning the day which is one hundred and eighty one (181) days following the Issue Date and ending
on the date which is three hundred and sixty four (364) days following the Issue Date, the Borrower shall have the right, exercisable
on not less than twenty (20) Trading Days prior written notice to the Holder of the Note to prepay the outstanding Note (principal
and accrued interest), in full by making a payment to the Holder of an amount in cash equal to 150%, multiplied by the sum of:
(w) the then outstanding principal amount of this Note plus (x) accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal amount of this
Note plus (y) Default Interest. 

(c)        After
the expiration of three hundred and sixty four (364) days, the Borrower shall have no right of prepayment. 

Any notice
of prepayment hereunder (an  Optional Prepayment Notice ) shall be delivered to the Holder of the Note at its registered
addresses and shall state: (1) that the Borrower is exercising its right to prepay the Note, and (2) the date of prepayment which
shall be not more than twenty (20) Trading Days from the date of the Optional Prepayment Notice. On the date fixed for prepayment
(the  Optional Prepayment Date ), the Borrower shall make payment of the applicable prepayment amount to or upon the
order of the Holder as specified by the Holder in writing to the Borrower at least one (1) business day prior to the Optional Prepayment
Date.  If  the Borrower delivers an Optional Prepayment
Notice and fails to pay the applicable prepayment amount due to the Holder of the Note within two (2) business days following the
Optional Prepayment Date, the Borrower shall forever forfeit its right to prepay the Note pursuant to this Section 1.9. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Note, the Borrower s right to prepay the amounts outstanding under this Note, in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Note, is expressly conditional upon the Holder s written acceptance, in Holder s
sole discretion, of such applicable prepayment during the time that the Borrower is exercising their right to prepay this Note. 

ARTICLE II. CERTAIN COVENANTS 

2.1          Sale

Holder upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Note as and when required by this Note (or makes any written announcement,
statement or threat that it does not intend to honor the obligations described in this paragraph) and any such failure shall continue
uncured (or any written announcement, statement or threat not to honor its obligations shall not be rescinded in writing) for three
(3) business days after the Holder shall have delivered a Notice of Conversion.  It
 is an obligation of the Borrower to remain current in its obligations to its transfer agent. It shall be an event of default
of this Note, if a conversion of this Note is delayed, hindered or frustrated due to a balance owed by the Borrower to its transfer

Date), the Note shall become immediately due and payable and the Borrower shall pay to the Holder, in full satisfaction of
its obligations hereunder, an amount equal to the Default Sum (as defined herein). UPON THE OCCURRENCE AND DURING THE

Articles III (other than failure to pay the principal hereof or interest thereon at the Maturity Date specified in Section
3,1 hereof), the Note shall become immediately due and payable and the Borrower shall pay to the Holder, in full satisfaction
of its obligations hereunder, an amount equal to the greater of (i) 150% times the sum of (w) the then outstanding principal
amount of this Note plus (x) accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal amount of this Note to the date of payment
(the  Mandatory Prepayment Date ) plus (y) Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in clauses (w)
and/or (x) plus (z) any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g) hereof (the then outstanding principal
amount of this Note to the date of payment plus the amounts referred to in clauses (x), (y) and (z) shall collectively be
known as the  Default Sum ) or (ii) the  parity value  of the Default Sum to be prepaid, where parity
value means (a) the highest number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to such
Default Sum in accordance with Article I, treating the Trading Day immediately preceding the Mandatory Prepayment Date as the
 Conversion Date  for purposes of determining the lowest applicable Conversion Price, unless the Default Event
arises as a result of a breach in respect of a specific Conversion Date in which case such Conversion Date shall be the
Conversion Date), multiplied by (b) the highest Closing Price for the Common Stock during the period beginning on the date of
first occurrence of the Event of Default and ending one day prior to the Mandatory Prepayment Date (the  Default
Amount ) and all other amounts payable hereunder shall immediately become due and payable, all without demand,
presentment or notice, all of which hereby are expressly waived, together with all costs, including, without limitation,
legal fees and expenses, of collection, and the Holder shall be entitled to exercise all other rights and remedies available
at law or in equity. 

If the
Borrower fails to pay the Default Amount within five (5) business days of written notice that such amount is due and payable, then
the Holder shall have the right at any time, so long as the Borrower remains in default (and so long and to the extent that there
are sufficient authorized shares), to require the Borrower, upon written notice, to immediately issue, in lieu of the Default Amount,
the number of shares of Common Stock of the Borrower equal to the Default Amount divided by the Conversion Price then in effect. 

ARTICLE IV. MISCELLANEOUS 

4.1        Failure
or Indulgence Not Waiver . No failure or delay on the part of the Holder in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other

4.9         Notice

Stock unless and only to the extent that it converts this Note into Common Stock. The Borrower shall provide the Holder with prior
notification of any meeting of the Borrower s shareholders (and copies of proxy materials and other information sent to
shareholders). In the event of any taking by the Borrower of a record of its shareholders for the purpose of determining shareholders
who are entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire
(including by way of merger, consolidation, reclassification or recapitalization) any share of any class or any other securities

The Borrower acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holder, by vitiating
the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the Borrower acknowledges that the remedy at law for
a breach of its obligations under this Note will be inadequate and agrees, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the
Borrower of the provisions of this Note, that the Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies at law
or in equity, and in addition to the penalties assessable herein, to an injunction or injunctions restraining, preventing or curing

loss and without any bond or other security being required. 

4.14
      ACH Payment Authorization . Borrower irrevocably authorizes Holder s right to
withdraw (through an ACH debit or otherwise)  $63,825.00/240 Days = $265.94/ Per day  (the  Specific Daily
Repayment Amount ) (subject to adjustment as provided herein) from the Borrower s bank account (initially, the
bank account identified on Exhibit B attached hereto, but also including any subsequent bank account of the Borrower if such
account is changed) (the  Bank Account ), on each business day, until this Note is satisfied in full.
Borrower shall provide Holder with all required access codes to effectuate any and all ACH debit transactions as provided for
in this Note. Borrower understands that it is responsible for ensuring that at least the Specific Daily Repayment Amount
remains in its Bank Account on each business day until this Note is satisfied in full, and that the Borrower shall be
responsible for any charges incurred by the Holder resulting from a rejected ACH attempt, insufficient funds in the Bank
Account, and/or all related bank charges. Such charges shall be immediately added to the outstanding balance of the Note. The
Specific Daily Repayment Amount shall automatically adjust to such prorated higher amount based upon the addition of charges
to the outstanding balance of Note, as well as to reflect any penalties incurred or events of defaults triggered under the
terms of the Note (to be calculated as follows: the total outstanding amount under the Note (including but not limited to all
principal, interest, charges, penalties, and additions due to any event of default) divided by the number of business days
remaining prior to the Maturity Date). Holder shall not be responsible for any overdrafts or rejected transactions that
result from Holder s ACH debiting of the Specific Daily Repayment Amount as provided in this Note and the
exhibits hereto. Holder may debit the Specific Daily Repayment Amount each business day. 

The Holder shall be permitted to aggregate
the Specific Daily Repayment Amount of all convertible promissory notes then issued by the Borrower to the Holder, and withdraw
such aggregated amount from the Borrower s bank account, in the interest of reducing overall fees associated with the ACH
debit transactions. 

The Holder may, from time to time,
provide a schedule to the Borrower via electronic mail (each a  Schedule ) to  George@codegreenapparel.com   
or  Tom@codegreenapparel.com , showing the outstanding balance of the Note as well as all ACH debits, conversion amounts,
and/or all other adjustments as provided in the Note (the  Schedule ). If the Borrower does not respond to the Holder,
via electronic mail to  info@carebourncapital.com , stating that the respective Schedule is accurate or disputing the amounts
contained therein (with objective documentation unequivocally supporting such dispute), within two (2) business days of receipt
of the respective Schedule, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have irrevocably approved the amounts contained in such respective
Schedule.
