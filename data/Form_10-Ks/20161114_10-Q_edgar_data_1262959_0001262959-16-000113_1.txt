1.  Organization 
    
  The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared according to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted according to such rules and regulations. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in Hines Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, all adjustments and eliminations, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly and in conformity with GAAP the financial position of Hines Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. as of   September 30, 2016   and the results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   have been included. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. 
    
  Hines Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., ( Hines REIT  and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the  Company ), was formed on   August 5, 2003   under the General Corporation Law of the state of Maryland for the purpose of engaging in the business of investing in and owning interests in real estate. Beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2004, the Company operated and intends to continue to operate in a manner to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for federal income tax purposes. The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of the Company s current and future business is and will be conducted through its majority-owned subsidiary, Hines REIT Properties, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ). Hines REIT is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. The business of the Company is managed by Hines Advisors Limited Partnership (the  Advisor ), an affiliate of Hines Interests Limited Partnership ( Hines ), pursuant to the advisory agreement between the Company and the Advisor (the  Advisory Agreement ). 
    
  Hines REIT has raised approximately   $2.7 billion   through public offerings of its common stock, including shares of its common stock offered pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan, since Hines REIT commenced its initial public offering in June 2004.  The Company commenced a   $150.0 million   offering of shares of its common stock under its dividend reinvestment plan on   July 1, 2010  , which closed on   June 30, 2012  , immediately prior to the commencement of the Company s subsequent   $300.0 million   offering of shares of its common stock under its dividend reinvestment plan on   July 1, 2012  . The Company refers to both offerings of shares under its dividend reinvestment plan collectively as the  DRP Offering.  From inception of the DRP Offering through   September 30, 2016  , Hines REIT received gross offering proceeds of   $214.7 million   from the sale of   28.2 million   shares through the DRP Offering. On May 31, 2016, the Company s board of directors voted to suspend indefinitely the Company s dividend reinvestment plan effective as of June 30, 2016.  
    
  Hines REIT contributed all net proceeds from its public offerings to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units in the Operating Partnership. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Hines REIT owned a   91.1%   and   91.8%   general partner interest, respectively, in the Operating Partnership. Hines 2005 VS I LP, an affiliate of Hines, owned a   0.5%   limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . In addition, another affiliate of Hines, HALP Associates Limited Partnership ( HALP ), owned an   8.4%   and   7.7%   profits interest (the  Participation Interest ) in the Operating Partnership as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The Company has concentrated its efforts on actively managing its assets and exploring a variety of strategic opportunities focused on enhancing the composition of its portfolio and its total return potential for its stockholders. On June 29, 2016, in connection with a review of potential strategic alternatives available to the Company, the Company s board of directors determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to sell all or substantially all of the Company s properties and assets and liquidate and dissolve pursuant to a plan of liquidation and dissolution (the  Plan of Liquidation ). The principal purpose of the liquidation is to seek to maximize stockholder value by liquidating the Company s assets and distributing the net proceeds of the liquidation to the holders of the Company s common stock.  As part of the Plan of Liquidation, the Company and certain of its affiliates have entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase, dated as of June 29, 2016, with BRE Hydra Property Owner LLC ( Purchaser  and such agreement, the  West Coast Asset Agreement ) to sell to Purchaser, an affiliate of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VIII L.P., for a purchase price of   $1.162 billion  , the following   seven   properties of the Company: Howard Hughes Center in Los Angeles, California, Laguna Buildings in Redmond, Washington, 2100 Powell in Emeryville, California, 1900 and 2000 Alameda in San Mateo, California, Daytona Buildings in Redmond, Washington, 5th and Bell in Seattle, Washington and 2851 Junction Avenue in San Jose, California (collectively, the  West  
  
   5 

     Table of Contents  

Coast Assets , and such transaction the  West Coast Asset Sale ).   As required by Maryland law and the Company s charter, the Plan of Liquidation was approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of the Company s common stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon at the Company s annual meeting of shareholders held on November 7, 2016.  The West Coast Asset Sale closed thereafter on November 10, 2016.  If the sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets is completed as expected, the Company expects to make one or more liquidating distributions to its stockholders during the period of the liquidation process and expects to make the first of these liquidating distributions to its stockholders prior to December 31, 2016. There can be no assurances regarding the amounts of any distributions or the timing thereof.  
    
  Directly-owned and Indirectly-owned Properties 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned direct and indirect investments in   14   properties. These properties consisted of   13   U.S. office properties and   one   grocery-anchored shopping center.  See Note 3   Real Estate Investments   Property Sales for more information.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the directly-owned assets were classified as held for sale.  See Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Assets Held for Sale and Associated Liabilities Held for Sale for additional information.  
    
  The Company made investments directly through entities that are wholly-owned by the Operating Partnership, or indirectly through other entities, such as through its investment in Hines US Core Office Fund LP (the  Core Fund ) in which it owned a   28.8%   non-managing general partner interest as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Company accounts for its investment in the Core Fund using the equity method of accounting.  
    
  Unconsolidated VIEs 
    
  The Company has a non-managing general partner interest of   28.8%   in the Core Fund. The Core Fund was determined to be a variable interest entity ( VIE )  in which the Company was determined not to be the primary beneficiary since the managing general partner has the ability to direct the activities that significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE. The Company s maximum loss exposure is expected to change in future periods as a result of additional contributions made. Other than the initial capital contributions provided by the Company, the Company has not provided any additional subordinated financial support. See Note 5   Investments in Unconsolidated Entities for information regarding the activity of the Company s unconsolidated entities as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  The table below summarizes the Company s maximum loss exposure related to its investment in the unconsolidated VIE as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which is equal to the carrying value of its investment in the unconsolidated VIE included in the balance sheet line item  Investment in unconsolidated entities  as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands).

    Represents the Company s contributions, net of distributions, made to its VIEs, as well as the Company s share of equity in earnings (losses) on the investment as of the date indicated. 

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Described below are certain of the Company s significant accounting policies.  The disclosures regarding several of the policies have been condensed or omitted in accordance with interim reporting regulations specified by Form 10-Q.  Please see the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a complete listing of all of its significant accounting policies.

Basis of Presentation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include the accounts of Hines REIT, the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership s wholly-owned subsidiaries as well as the related amounts of noncontrolling interests.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02, the Company has determined that the Operating Partnership is considered a VIE.  However, the Company meets the disclosure exemption criteria under ASU 2015-02, as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE and the Company s partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest.  
    
  The Company has retroactively changed, for all prior periods presented, its classification of distributions in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of equity by reflecting such distributions as charges against  accumulated distributions in excess of earnings.   This presentation change had no impact on the total equity balances in any of the periods presented. 
    
  The Company s investments in partially-owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships are reviewed for impairment periodically. The Company will record an impairment charge if it determines that a decline in the value of an investment below its carrying value is other than temporary.  The Company s analysis will be dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment, current market conditions, and its intent and ability to hold the investment to full recovery.  Based on the Company s analysis of the facts and circumstances at each reporting period,   no   impairment was recorded related to its investment in the Core Fund for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  However, if market conditions deteriorate in the future and result in lower valuations or reduced cash flows of the Company s remaining investment in the Core Fund, impairment charges may be recorded in future periods. 
    
  International Operations 
    
  In addition to its properties in the United States, the Company has owned investments in Canada and Brazil, although the Company no longer owns any operating investments outside the United States as of   September 30, 2016  .  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of   September 30, 2016   is related to the remaining non-operating net assets of the disposed directly-owned properties in Brazil and Canada. 
    
  Assets Held for Sale and Associated Liabilities Held for Sale 
    
  In June 2016, the Company s board of directors approved the Plan of Liquidation. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , all of the Company s directly-held properties were under contract to sell, except for a property which was being marketed for sale as of that date and now is sold as of the date of this filing. The Company determined that the West Coast Assets were a disposal group, as they were under contract to sell in one transaction to the same buyer.  Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016, the Company determined that all of its directly-owned properties and their related assets and associated liabilities were classified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  .  At December 31, 2015, no assets were classified as held for sale by the Company. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , assets held for sale consisted of the following (in thousands):

As of   September 30, 2016  , liabilities associated with assets held for sale consisted of the following (in thousands): 

As of June 30, 2016, the Company determined that all of its directly-owned properties were classified as held for sale, therefore,   no   depreciation and amortization were recorded on these assets for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Impairment of Investment Property 
    
  Real estate assets are reviewed for impairment in each reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the individual property may not be recoverable. In such an event, a comparison will be made of the current and projected cash flows of each property on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property. If undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, such carrying amount would be adjusted, if necessary, to estimated fair values to reflect impairment in the value of the asset. As of   September 30, 2016  , all assets are held for sale and impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or disposal group, as applicable, to the fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount is greater than the fair value less cost to sell, the asset value is considered impaired, and the carrying amount is written down to the fair value less cost to sell.  See Note 13   Fair Value Disclosures for additional information regarding the Company s policy for determining fair values of its investment properties.  
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company determined that   three   of its directly-owned properties located in Dallas, Texas, Houston, Texas and Bellevue, Washington were impaired because such assets were classified as held for sale and their carrying values exceeded their fair values less cost to sell primarily due to reduced purchase price or increased closing costs. As a result, impairment losses were recorded related to those properties of   $6.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The property located in Dallas, Texas was sold in August 2016. See Note 3   Real Estate Investments   Property Sales for more information. Additionally, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded impairment losses of   $30.4 million   on   four   of its directly-owned properties located in Melville, New York, Dallas, Texas, Houston, Texas and Bellevue, Washington because such assets were classified as held for sale and their carrying values exceeded their fair values less cost to sell. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company determined that   two   of its directly-owned properties located in Dallas, Texas and Melville, New York were impaired since the projected undiscounted cash flows for these properties were less than their carrying values. As a result, impairment losses of   $16.0 million   were recorded related to those properties for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , impairment losses of   $30.6 million   were recorded related to   two   of the Company's indirectly-owned properties located in Phoenix, Arizona and Woodland Hills, California. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , impairment losses of   $66.6 million   were recorded related to   three   of the Company s indirectly-owned properties located in Phoenix, Arizona, Sacramento, California and Woodland Hills, California. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , impairment losses of   $16.7 million   and   $38.8 million   were recorded related to   one   of the Company s indirectly-owned properties located in Richmond, Virginia. The property located in Richmond, Virginia was sold in December 2015. See Note 5   Investments in Unconsolidated Entities for additional information.  
    
  Tenant and Other Receivables 
    
  Receivable balances outstanding consist primarily of base rents, tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to straight-line rent.  An allowance for the uncollectible portion of tenant and other receivables is determined based upon an analysis of the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. Tenant and other receivables are shown at cost in the table above describing assets held for sale, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of   $1.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Tenant and other receivables are shown at cost in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of   $4.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  .

Deferred Leasing Costs 
    
  As of June 30, 2016, the Company determined that all of its directly-owned properties were classified as held for sale, therefore,   no   depreciation and amortization were recorded on these assets for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Tenant inducement amortization was   $4.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and was recorded as an offset to rental revenue. In addition, the Company recorded   $1.3 million   as amortization expense related to other direct leasing costs for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Tenant inducement amortization was   $10.7 million   and   $12.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was recorded as an offset to rental revenue. In addition, the Company recorded   $3.2 million   and   $3.9 million   as amortization expense related to other direct leasing costs for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Deferred Financing Costs 
    
  Deferred financing costs consist of direct costs incurred in obtaining debt financing. These costs are presented as a direct reduction to the related debt liability for permanent mortgages and presented as an asset for revolving credit arrangements. In total, deferred financing costs were   $0.3 million   and   $1.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  These costs are amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the terms of the obligations. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   $0.7 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively, of deferred financing costs were amortized into interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   $1.5 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively, of deferred financing costs were amortized into interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  
    
  Other Assets 
    
  Other assets included the following (in thousands): 

(1)    As of   September 30, 2016  , these amounts were classified as held for sale. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Rental payments are generally paid by the tenants prior to the beginning of each month. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded liabilities of   $6.3 million   related to prepaid rental payments which were included in other liabilities in the table above describing liabilities associated with assets held for sale.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC  or the  Codification ) to provide guidance on consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.  These amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted.  The Company has evaluated the impact of the adoption of these amendments on its consolidated financial statements and has determined that the Company s operating partnership is considered a VIE.  However, the Company meets the disclosure exemption criteria, as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE and the Company s partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest. The Company has also determined that the Core Fund will be considered to be a VIE as a result of this new guidance.  However, the Company will not consolidate the Core Fund since the Company is not the primary beneficiary. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued new guidance that eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively.  Pursuant to the new guidance, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment.  This new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that requires the impairment of financial instruments to be based on expected credit losses.  These amendments are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted for years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued amendments to the Codification to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in the ASU are effective for public entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for all other entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements.

derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  The fair values of the Company s interest rate contracts have been determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts).  The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The Company did not have any interest rate swap contracts in effect as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Although the Company has determined the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparty, Deutsche Bank. In adjusting the fair values of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds and guarantees. However, as of   December 31, 2015  , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuations of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined its derivative valuations are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The following fair value hierarchy table sets forth the Company s interest rate swaps which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which equals book value, by level within the fair value hierarchy as of   December 31, 2015   (in thousands).  The Company s derivative financial instruments are recorded in interest rate swap contracts in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company has not designated any of its derivative instruments as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. See Note 7   Derivative Instruments for information regarding derivative financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016  .

Financial Instruments Fair Value Disclosures 
    
  Other Financial Instruments 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company did   no  t have any outstanding notes payable. As of   December 31, 2015  , management estimated that the fair value of notes payable, which had a carrying value (excluding any unamortized discount or premium and unamortized deferred financing fees) of   $853.4 million  , was   $866.3 million  . The discount rates used approximate current lending rates for loans or groups of loans with similar maturities and credit quality, assumes the debt is outstanding through maturity and considers the debt s collateral (if applicable).  Management has utilized market information as available or present value techniques to estimate the amounts required to be disclosed. The Company has determined the majority of the inputs used to value its notes payable fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, however the credit quality adjustments associated with its fair value of notes payable utilize Level 3 inputs. However, as of   December 31, 2015  , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit quality adjustments on the overall valuations of its fair market value of notes payable and has determined that they are not significant.  As a result, the Company has determined these financial instruments utilize Level 2 inputs. Since such amounts are estimates that are based on limited available market information for similar transactions, there can be no assurance that the disclosed values could be realized. 
    
  Other financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, distributions receivable, tenant and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, other liabilities, due to affiliates and distributions payable.  The carrying value of these items reasonably approximates their fair value based on their highly-liquid nature and/or short-term maturities.  Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
    
   Certain long-lived assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments (i.e., impairments) in certain circumstances.  The fair value  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

methodologies used to measure long-lived assets are described in Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Impairment of Investment Property.  The inputs associated with the valuation of long-lived assets are generally included in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as discussed below. 
    
  Impairment of Investment Property 
    
  Investment properties are reviewed for impairment at each reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company determined that   four   of its directly-owned investments located in Melville, New York, Dallas, Texas, Houston, Texas and Bellevue, Washington, were impaired based on such long-lived assets having carrying values that exceeded their fair values less costs to sell based on the purchase and sale agreements and potential bids received during the nine month period. As of   September 30, 2016  , all of these directly-owned investments were classified as held for sale. 
    
  Additionally, for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company determined that   two   of its directly-owned investments located in Dallas, Texas and Melville, New York were impaired since the projected undiscounted cash flows for each of these properties was less than each of their carrying values. 
    
  These changes in assumptions resulted in the net book value of the assets exceeding the projected undiscounted cash flows for these investments. As a result, these assets were written down to fair value. The following table summarizes activity for the Company s assets measured at fair value, on a non-recurring basis, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

(1) Excludes impairment loss on disposed assets. 
    
  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company s estimated fair value of investment properties in Dallas, Texas and Melville, New York was based on a comparison of recent market activity and discounted cash flow models, which include estimates of property-specific inflows and outflows over a specific holding period. Significant unobservable quantitative inputs used in determining the fair value of each investment property for the period ended   December 31, 2015   include: (1) a discount rate ranging from   7.0%   to   8.3%  ; (2) a capitalization rate ranging from   4.7%   to   9.7%  ; (3) stabilized occupancy rates ranging from   93%   to   94%  ; and (4) current market rental rates ranging from   $21.50   per square foot to   $30.00   per square foot. These inputs are based on the location, type and nature of each property, current and anticipated market conditions, and management s knowledge and expertise in real estate. 

14.  Reportable Segments 
    
  The Company s investments in real estate are geographically diversified and management evaluates the operating performance of each at an individual property level. The Company has determined it has   three   reportable segments: (1) office properties, (2) an industrial property and (3) retail properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , the office properties segment consisted of   9   office properties that the Company owned directly as well as   4   office properties that were owned indirectly through the Company s investment in the Core Fund. The retail segment consisted of   one   grocery-anchored shopping center. The industrial property segment consisted of   one   industrial property located in Dallas, Texas, which was sold in April 2015. 
    
  The Company s indirect investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As such, the activities of these investments are reflected in investments in unconsolidated entities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated entities, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

  Executive Summary 
    
  Hines Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. ( Hines REIT  and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries,  we ,  us  or the  Company ) and its subsidiary, Hines REIT Properties, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ) were formed in August 2003 for the purpose of investing in and owning interests in real estate. We raised approximately $  2.7 billion   through various public offerings of our common stock from 2004 to 2009. We used these proceeds to invest in real estate in order to satisfy our primary investment objectives, including preserving invested capital, paying regular cash distributions and achieving modest capital appreciation of our assets over the long term. We have made investments directly through entities wholly owned by the Operating Partnership or indirectly through other entities such as through our investment in the Core Fund. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had direct and indirect interests in   14   properties. These properties consist of   13   office properties located throughout the United States and   one   grocery-anchored shopping center.  In total, we acquired interests in   66   properties since our inception and have sold our interests in   63   of those properties as of   November 14, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

The following table provides summary information regarding the properties in which we owned interests as of   September 30, 2016  . All assets which are 100% owned by us are referred to as  directly-owned properties.  All other properties are owned indirectly through investments in the Core Fund. 

(1) 
    This percentage shows the effective ownership of the Operating Partnership in the properties listed. On   September 30, 2016  , Hines REIT owned a   91.1%   interest in the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner. Affiliates of Hines owned the remaining   8.9%   interest in the Operating Partnership. In addition, we owned an approximate   28.8%   non-managing general partner interest in the Core Fund as of   September 30, 2016  . The Core Fund does not own 100% of these properties; its ownership interest in its properties ranges from   67.8%   to   84.9%  .

    In November 2016, the Core Fund entered into a contract to sell Renaissance Square. The Core Fund expects the closing of this sale to occur during the fourth quarter of 2016. 

(9) 
    This amount represents the percentage leased assuming we own a 100% interest in each of these properties.  The percentage leased based on our effective ownership interest in each property is   89%  . 
       
  Since the conclusion of our public offerings, we have concentrated our efforts on actively managing our assets and exploring a variety of strategic opportunities focused on enhancing the composition of our portfolio and its total return potential for our stockholders.  In doing this, we have elected to make strategic dispositions, which have provided us with additional liquidity. We have used the proceeds from such dispositions to make additional strategic acquisitions focused on high-quality office assets located on the West Coast in order to best position our portfolio for a liquidity event, such as our purchase of 2851 Junction Avenue, which we acquired in May 2015, Civica Office Commons, which we acquired in February 2015 and the Howard Hughes Center, which we acquired in January 2014.  
    
  On June 29, 2016, in connection with a review of our potential strategic alternatives, our board of directors determined that it is in our best interest and in the best interest of our stockholders to sell all or substantially all of our properties and assets and liquidate and dissolve pursuant to a plan of liquidation and dissolution (the  Plan of Liquidation ). The principal purpose of the liquidation is to seek to maximize stockholder value by liquidating our assets and distributing the net proceeds of the liquidation to our stockholders.  As part of the Plan of Liquidation, we and certain of our affiliates have entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase, dated as of June 29, 2016, with BRE Hydra Property Owner LLC ( Purchaser  and such agreement, the  West Coast Asset Agreement ) to sell to Purchaser, an affiliate of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VIII L.P., for a purchase price of   $1.162 billion  , the following seven properties of the Company: Howard Hughes Center in Los Angeles, California, Laguna Buildings in Redmond, Washington, 2100 Powell in Emeryville, California, 1900 and 2000 Alameda in San Mateo, California, Daytona Buildings in Redmond, Washington, 5th and Bell in Seattle, Washington and 2851 Junction Avenue in San Jose, California (collectively, the  West Coast Assets , and such transaction the  West Coast Asset Sale ).  As required by Maryland law and our charter, the Plan of Liquidation was approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon at our annual meeting of shareholders held on November 7, 2016.  The West Coast Asset Sale closed thereafter on November 10, 2016.  If the sale of all or substantially all of our assets is completed as expected, we expect to make one or more liquidating distributions to our stockholders during the period of the liquidation process and expect to make the first of these liquidating distributions to our stockholders prior to December 31, 2016. There can be no assurances regarding the amounts of any distributions or the timing thereof.  
    
  Our portfolio was   89%   and   88%   leased (based on our effective ownership) as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. As a result of the strategic acquisitions and dispositions described above, as of   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio was geographically located   88%   in the West,   3%   in the East and   9%   in the South. Our management closely monitors the portfolio s lease expirations, which for the period from   October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016  , and for each of the years ending December 31,   2017   through December 31,   2020  , are expected to approximate   2%  ,   7%  ,   15%  ,   9%   and   8%  , respectively, of leasable square feet. We believe this level of expirations is manageable. Although we continue to lease our properties to a diverse tenant base over a variety of industries, as of   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio was approximately   16%   leased to over   33   companies in the financial and insurance industries, approximately   15%   leased to over   27   companies in the information and technology industries, approximately   13%   leased to over   15   companies in the manufacturing industry and approximately   9%   leased to over   34   companies in the professional services industry.  
    
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Each of our critical accounting policies involves the use of estimates that require management to make assumptions that are subjective in nature. Management relies on its experience, collects historical and current market data, and analyzes these assumptions in order to arrive at what it believes to be reasonable estimates. In addition, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment regarding assumptions as to future uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates. A disclosure of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  There have been no significant changes to our policies during   2016  .

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  General 
    
  Our principal cash requirements have been for the acquisition of real estate investments, property-level operating expenses, capital improvements and leasing costs, strategic investments in real property, debt service, corporate-level general and administrative expenses, distributions and redemptions. We have four primary sources of capital for meeting our cash requirements: 

proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan, which was suspended effective as of June 30, 2016; 
                
    debt financings, including secured or unsecured facilities; 
                
    proceeds from the sale of our properties, including those owned by the Core Fund; and 
                
    cash flow generated by our real estate investments and operations. 
       
  We are focused on maintaining a strong cash position and managing our capital needs. Our liquidity needs were primarily met through cash flow generated by our properties and distributions from unconsolidated entities. Additionally, due to our ability to execute on several strategic asset sales, we had available liquidity to acquire additional investment properties in order to reposition our portfolio for a liquidity event. As described earlier, our board of directors and our shareholders have approved the Plan of Liquidation.  In accordance with the Plan of Liquidation, we plan to sell all of our remaining directly-owned properties and we also plan to sell all of the remaining properties we own indirectly thorough the Core Fund. After the payment or provision for all of our outstanding liabilities, we expect to distribute the sales proceeds to our stockholders. Below is a list of the properties sold by us and the Core Fund during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 
    
  Hines REIT Asset Sales 

345 Inverness Drive and Arapahoe Business Park   -   In May 2016, we sold 345 Inverness Drive and Arapahoe Business Park, two office buildings located in Denver, Colorado, for a sales price of   $78.5 million  . We acquired 345 Inverness Drive and Arapahoe Business Park in December 2008 for a purchase price of   $66.5 million  . We received net proceeds of   $76.2 million   from this sale. 

JPMorgan Chase Tower   - In August 2016, we sold JPMorgan Chase Tower, an office building located in Dallas, Texas, for a sales price of   $273.0 million  . We acquired JPMorgan Chase Tower in November 2007 for a purchase price of   $289.6 million  . We received net proceeds of   $262.7 million   from this sale. 

Grocery-Anchored Portfolio properties   - In August 2016, we sold   seven   of the Grocery-Anchored Portfolio properties, exclusive of Champions Village, for an aggregate net sale price of   $158.0 million  . The Grocery-Anchored Portfolio consists of eight grocery-anchored shopping centers that were acquired in January 2014 for   $178.2 million   in aggregate. We received net proceeds of   $152.3 million   from this sale.

Core Fund Asset Sales 

The Carillon Building   - In January 2016, the Core Fund sold The Carillon Building, an office building located in Charlotte, North Carolina, for a sales price of   $147.0 million  . The Carillon Building was acquired in July 2007 for a purchase price of   $140.0 million  . The Core Fund received net proceeds of   $88.1 million   from this sale. We recognized a gain on sale of   $14.4 million  . At the date of disposition, we owned a 24% effective interest in The Carillon Building. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities was   $4.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to net cash   provided by   operating activities of   $44.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This decrease is primarily due to less proceeds from distributions from the sale of Core Fund assets and our dispositions of several properties during 2016 and 2015. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash   provided by   investing activities was   $933.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to net cash   provided by   investing activities of   $6.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The factors that contributed to the change between the two periods are summarized below. 
    
  2016 

We received proceeds of   $915.2 million   from the sale of 1515 S. Street, 345 Inverness Drive and Arapahoe Business Park, 3400 Data Drive, JPMorgan Chase Tower, seven of the Grocery-Anchored Portfolio properties and 321 North Clark in   2016   and   $1.0 million   primarily related to the release of an escrow from a previous sale. 

We received distributions from the Core Fund totaling   $22.5 million  , all of which was included in cash flows from investing activities, as they exceeded our equity in earnings of the joint venture. 

We had cash outflows related to capital expenditures at operating properties of   $3.6 million  . 
       
  2015 

We received distributions from the Core Fund totaling   $81.1 million  , of which   $53.4 million   was included in cash flows from investing activities, as they exceeded our equity in earnings of the joint venture. 

We had cash outflows related to capital expenditures at operating properties of   $9.6 million  . 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash   used in   financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $849.9 million   as compared to the same period in the prior year. This   decrease   is primarily due to our repayment of the remaining balances on our debt in the current period.

Distributions 
    
  In order to meet the requirements for being treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and to pay regular cash distributions to our stockholders, which is one of our investment objectives, we have declared distributions to stockholders (as authorized by our board of directors) as of daily record dates and aggregate through June 2016 and have paid such distributions quarterly. With the authorization of our board of directors, we declared distributions for the period from January   2015   through June   2016  . These distributions were calculated based on stockholders of record each day during this period in an amount equal to   $0.00073973   per share, per day and were paid on the first day of the month following the fiscal quarter to which they relate in cash, or, with respect to distributions paid for the three months ended March 31, 2016, reinvested in stock for those participating in our dividend reinvestment plan. On May 31, 2016, our board of directors voted to suspend indefinitely our dividend reinvestment plan effective as of June 30, 2016.  Accordingly, all distributions for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were paid in cash.  In connection with the Plan of Liquidation, we determined to cease paying regular quarterly distributions after the payment of the distributions for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 
    
  The table below outlines our total distributions declared to stockholders and noncontrolling interests for each of the quarters during   2016   and   2015  , including the breakout between the distributions paid in cash and those reinvested pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan (all amounts are in thousands). 

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we funded our cash distributions with cash flows from operating activities (  31%  ) and the remaining cash distributions were funded from distributions from unconsolidated entities, proceeds from the sales of our real estate investments and excess undistributed cash flows from prior periods (  69%  ). For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we funded our cash distributions with cash flows from operating activities (  91%  ) and proceeds from the sales of our real estate investments (  9%  ).

Redemptions 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we funded redemptions of   $14.6 million   and   $26.9 million  , respectively, pursuant to the terms of our share redemption program. Generally, funds available for redemption are limited to the amount of proceeds received from our dividend reinvestment plan in the prior quarter. However, our board of directors has the discretion to redeem shares in excess of this amount if it determines there are sufficient available funds and it is appropriate to do so as long as the total amount redeemed does not exceed the amount required to redeem 10% of our shares outstanding as of the same date in the prior calendar year.  Our board of directors determined to waive this limitation on the share redemption plan and fully honor all eligible requests received through the first quarter of 2016, which were in excess of the $  5.4 million   received from our dividend reinvestment plan in the prior quarter. On May 31, 2016, our board of directors determined to suspend indefinitely our share redemption program effective as of June 30, 2016.  

Debt Financings 
    
  We use debt financing from time to time for investments in real property, property improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs. Most of our debt was in the form of secured mortgage loans, which we entered into at the time each real estate asset was acquired. We had no outstanding notes payable as of   September 30, 2016   with respect to our directly-held properties, but due to debt on properties owned by the Core Fund, our portfolio was   6%   leveraged as of   September 30, 2016  , with   68%   of the debt in the form of fixed-rate mortgage loans. By comparison, our portfolio was   37%   leveraged as of   December 31, 2015  , with   53%   of our debt in the form of fixed-rate mortgage loans. This leverage percentage is calculated using the estimated aggregate value of our real estate investments (including our pro-rata share of real estate assets through our investments in other entities such as the Core Fund), cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand as of that date.  Additionally, as of   December 31, 2015  , our debt financing had a weighted average interest rate of   3.9%   (including the effect of interest rate swaps). 
    
  The following list summarizes our debt financings for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

Results of Operations 
    
  RESULTS OF OUR DIRECTLY-OWNED PROPERTIES 
    
  We directly owned   8   same-store properties as of January 1, 2015 that were   89%   leased as of   September 30, 2016   as compared to   87%   leased as of   September 30, 2015  . The table below includes revenues and expenses of our directly-owned properties for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Disposed properties include the results of operations of properties that were sold, but whose results were not classified as discontinued operations (all amounts in thousands, except for percentages):   

(1) 
     Property revenues in excess of expenses include total revenues less property operating expenses, real property taxes, and property management fees. 
       
  The increase in property revenues in excess of expenses for the same-store properties for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is primarily due to an increase in leasing activity.

     Table of Contents  

Depreciation and amortization decreased during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to the sale of several properties during   2015   and the sale of 1515 S. Street in April 2016, 345 Inverness Drive and Arapahoe Business Park in May   2016  , 3400 Data Drive in July 2016, JPMorgan Chase Tower, and seven of the Grocery-Anchored Portfolio properties and 321 North Clark in August 2016. As of June 30, 2016, we determined that all of our directly-owned properties were classified as held for sale, therefore, no depreciation and amortization were recorded on these assets during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Transaction expenses increased during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to an increase in legal fees associated with the Plan of Liquidation. 
    
  Gain on sale of real estate investments increased during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015   as a result of the sale of several properties in   2016  .  
    
  Interest expense decreased during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015   as a result of a decrease in total debt outstanding. 
    
  For the   third quarter   of   2016  , we determined that our directly-owned properties located in Dallas, Texas, Houston, Texas and Bellevue, Washington were impaired based on such long-lived assets having carrying values that exceeded their fair values less cost to sell. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of   $6.9 million   to write these assets down to fair value for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we determined that our directly-owned properties located in Melville, New York, Dallas, Texas, Houston, Texas and Bellevue, Washington were impaired based on such long-lived assets having carrying values that exceeded their fair values less cost to sell. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of   $30.4 million   to write these assets down to fair value for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  As a result of future expected disposals in accordance with the Plan of Liquidation and other factors, our results of operations for the period ended   September 30, 2016   could differ from our results of operations in future periods. 

RESULTS FOR OUR INDIRECTLY-OWNED PROPERTIES 
    
  Our Interest in the Core Fund 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a   28.8%   non-managing general partner interest in the Core Fund, which held interests in   4   properties that were   86%   leased. As of   September 30, 2015  , we owned a   28.8%   non-managing general partner interest in the Core Fund, which held interests in   8   properties that were   81%   leased.  
    
  Our equity in   losses   related to our investment in the Core Fund for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $7.9 million  , compared to equity in   losses   of   $5.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Our equity in   losses   related to our investment in the Core Fund for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $0.8 million  , compared to equity in   earnings   of   $27.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The change in our equity in earnings (losses) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily resulted from the following: 

In January 2016, the Core Fund sold The Carillon Building for a sales price of   $147.0 million  . The Carillon Building was acquired in July 2007 for a purchase price of   $140.0 million  . As a result of the sale, we recognized a gain on sale of   $14.4 million  , which is included in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated entities, net, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

In March 2016, the Core Fund sold 525 B Street for a sales price of   $122.0 million  . 525 B Street was acquired in August 2005 for a purchase price of   $116.3 million  . As a result of the sale, we recognized a gain on sale of   $3.6 million  , which is included in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated entities, net, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

In January 2015, a subsidiary of the Core Fund sold its remaining   51%   interest in the entity that owns One North Wacker for   $240.0 million  . The Core Fund previously sold a   49%   noncontrolling interest in One North Wacker in December 2011. One North Wacker was acquired in March 2008 for a purchase price of   $540.0 million  . As a result of the sale of the   51%   interest in One North Wacker, we recognized a gain on sale of   $34.3 million  , which is included in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated entities, net, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 

In April 2015, the Core Fund sold Charlotte Plaza for a sales price of   $160.0 million  . Charlotte Plaza was acquired in June 2007 for a purchase price of   $175.5 million  . As a result of the sale of Charlotte Plaza, the Core Fund recognized a gain on sale of   $27.4 million  . As a result of the sale, the Company recognized a gain on sale of   $6.7 million  , which is included in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated entities, net, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Core Fund recorded impairment losses of   $30.6 million   on Renaissance Square in Phoenix, Arizona and Warner Center in Woodland Hills, California since such long-lived assets had carrying values that exceeded their fair values based on a purchase and sale agreement or third-party guidance received during its marketing process. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Core Fund recorded impairment losses of   $66.6 million   on Renaissance Square in Phoenix, Arizona, Wells Fargo Center in Sacramento, California and Warner Center in Woodland Hills, California since such long-lived assets had carrying values that exceeded their fair values based on a purchase and sale agreement or third-party guidance received during its marketing process. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Core Fund recorded impairment losses of   $16.7 million   and   $38.8 million  , respectively, on Riverfront Plaza in Richmond, Virginia due to deterioration of market conditions. Riverfront Plaza was sold in December 2015. 

CORPORATE LEVEL ACTIVITIES 
    
  Other Corporate-level Activities 
    
  The tables below provide detail relating to our asset management fees and general and administrative expenses (all amounts in thousands, except percentages): 

We pay acquisition fees to our Advisor for services related to the due diligence, selection and acquisition of direct or indirect real estate investments. The acquisition fee is equal to 0.50% of (i) the purchase price of real estate investments acquired directly by us, including any debt attributable to such investments or (ii) when we make an investment indirectly through another entity, such investment s pro rata share of the gross asset value of real estate investments held by that entity.

     Table of Contents  

Acquisition fees decreased for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , due to no acquisition fees having been incurred for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , while acquisition fees were incurred on our acquisitions of Civica Office Commons in February 2015 and 2851 Junction Avenue in May 2015. In connection with the acquisition of Civica Office Commons, we were obligated to pay approximately   $2.1 million   of acquisition fees to our Advisor, half of which was payable in cash and half of which was payable related to the Participation Interest. Our Advisor and HALP, the holder of the Participation Interest, respectively, agreed to waive   $0.6 million   of the cash acquisition fee and all of the   $1.0 million   acquisition fee payable as an increase to the Participation Interest. In connection with the acquisition of 2851 Junction Avenue in May 2015, we were obligated to pay approximately $  0.9 million   of acquisition fees to the Advisor, half of which was payable in cash and half of which was payable as an increase to the Participation Interest. The Advisor and HALP, the holder of the Participation Interest, respectively, agreed to waive $  0.3 million   of the cash acquisition fee and all of the $  0.4 million   acquisition fee payable as an increase to the Participation Interest.  
    
  We also pay monthly asset management fees to our Advisor based on an annual fee equal to 1.5% of the amount of net equity capital invested in real estate investments. Our asset management fees decreased for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   partially due to our sales of real estate investments in   2015   and   2016  .  Additionally, we recorded a   $2.3 million   reduction in the Participation Interest liability as of June 30, 2016 based on our expectation to distribute approximately   $6.35   to   $6.65   per share to our shareholders pursuant to the execution of the Plan of Liquidation. 
    
  General and administrative expenses include legal and accounting fees, insurance costs, costs and expenses associated with our board of directors and other administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to an increase in legal fees. 

Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
    
  Funds from Operations ( FFO ) is a non-GAAP financial performance measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) and widely recognized by investors and analysts as one measure of operating performance of a real estate company. FFO excludes items such as real estate depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization, as applied in accordance with GAAP, implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and also assumes that such assets are adequately maintained and renovated as required in order to maintain their value. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions such as occupancy rates, rental rates, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, it is management s view, and we believe the view of many industry investors and analysts, that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone is insufficient. In addition, FFO excludes gains and losses from the sale of real estate and impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets and in-substance real estate equity investments, which we believe provides management and investors with a helpful additional measure of the historical performance of our real estate portfolio, as it allows for comparisons, year to year, that reflect the impact on operations from trends in items such as occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs. A property will be evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the property). Undiscounted future cash flows are based on anticipated operating performance, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, stockholders are cautioned that due to the limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges.  
    
  In addition to FFO, management uses modified funds from operations ( MFFO ), as defined by the Investment Program Association (the  IPA ), as a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure to evaluate our operating performance. The IPA has recommended the use of MFFO as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs to enhance the assessment of the operating performance of a non-listed REIT. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be useful as a measure of the long-term operating performance of our investments or as a comparative measure to other publicly registered, non-listed REITs if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended and described herein. MFFO includes funds generated by the operations of our real estate investments and funds used in our corporate-level operations. MFFO is based on FFO, but includes certain additional adjustments which we believe are appropriate. Such items include reversing the effects of straight-line rent revenue recognition, fair value adjustments to derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains or losses related to fair value adjustments for derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting, and gains or losses related to early extinguishment of hedges or debt. Some of these adjustments are necessary to address changes in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO.  These changes also have prompted a significant increase in the magnitude of non-cash and non-operating items included in FFO, as defined. Such items include amortization of out-of-market lease intangible assets and liabilities and certain tenant incentives.

     Table of Contents  

The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, including acquisition fees and expenses, is a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to our stockholders. MFFO excludes acquisition expenses. Under GAAP, acquisition expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. These expenses are paid in cash by us, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to our stockholders. All paid and accrued acquisition expenses with respect to the acquisition of a property negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which the property is acquired and will have negative effects on returns to our stockholders, the potential for future distributions, and future cash flows, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, the related acquisition expenses and other costs related to such property. In addition, if we acquire a property, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to the Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired. Since MFFO excludes acquisition expenses, MFFO would only be comparable to the operations of non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics.  
    
  MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.  
    
  Management uses MFFO to evaluate the financial performance of our investment portfolio. In addition, our board of directors has used MFFO to evaluate and establish our distribution policy and the sustainability thereof.  
    
  FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. In addition, FFO and MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our liquidity, but rather should be reviewed in conjunction with these and other GAAP measurements. Further, FFO and MFFO are not intended to be used as liquidity measures indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Please see the limitations listed below associated with the use of MFFO: 

We use interest rate swap contracts as economic hedges against the variability of interest rates on variable rate loans. Although we expect to hold these instruments to maturity, if we were to settle these instruments currently, it would have an impact on our operating performance. Additionally, these derivative instruments are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP. MFFO excludes gains (losses) related to changes in these estimated values of our derivative instruments because such adjustments may not be reflective of ongoing operations and may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. 

MFFO excludes acquisition expenses.  Although these amounts reduce net income, we have funded such costs during the periods presented with sales proceeds and acquisition-related indebtedness and do not consider these fees and expenses in the evaluation of our operating performance and determining MFFO. 

MFFO excludes impairment charges related to long-lived assets that have been written down to current market valuations.  Although these losses are included in the calculation of net income (loss), we have excluded them from MFFO because we believe doing so more appropriately presents the operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis. 

Our business is subject to volatility in the real estate markets and general economic conditions, and adverse changes in those conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and MFFO. Accordingly, the predictive nature of MFFO is uncertain and past performance may not be indicative of future results. 
       
  Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), NAREIT nor any regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or a regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.

The table below summarizes FFO and MFFO attributable to common stockholders for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and a reconciliation of such non-GAAP financial performance measures to our net income (loss) for the periods then ended (in thousands). 

(1) 
    Represents the depreciation and amortization of various real estate assets. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that such depreciation and amortization may be of limited relevance in evaluating current operating performance and, as such, these items are excluded from our determination of FFO. As of June 30, 2016, we determined that all of our directly-owned properties were classified as held for sale, therefore,   no   depreciation and amortization were recorded on these assets for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
       
           (2) 
    Represents the gain on disposition of certain real estate investments. Although this gain is included in the calculation of net income (loss), we have excluded it from FFO because we believe doing so more appropriately presents the operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis. This adjustment includes amounts from the  Gain (loss) on sale or dissolution of unconsolidated joint venture  and  Gain (loss) on sale of real estate investments  included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
       
           (3) 
    Represents impairment charges recorded for the   third quarter   of   2016   in accordance with GAAP. See  Results of Operations   Results of our Directly-Owned Properties  for additional information regarding our impairment charges. 
       
           (4) 
    Includes adjustments to equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated entities, net, similar to those described in Notes 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 for our unconsolidated entities, which are necessary to convert our share of income (loss) from unconsolidated entities to FFO and MFFO.

    Represents components of net income (loss) related to the estimated changes in the values of our interest rate swap derivatives.  We have excluded these changes in value from our evaluation of our operating performance and MFFO because we expect to hold the underlying instruments to their maturity and accordingly the interim gains or losses will remain unrealized. 
       
           (7) 
    Includes the following components of revenues and expenses that we do not consider in evaluating our operating performance and determining MFFO (in thousands): 

(a) 
    Represents the adjustments to rental revenue as required by GAAP to recognize minimum lease payments on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms.  We have excluded these adjustments from our evaluation of the operating performance of the Company and in determining MFFO because we believe that the rent that is billable during the current period is a more relevant measure of the Company s operating performance for such period. 
       
           (b) 
    Represents the amortization of lease incentives and out-of-market leases.  As stated in Note 1 above, historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that such amortization may be of limited relevance in evaluating current operating performance and, as such, these items are excluded from our determination of MFFO. As of June 30, 2016, we determined that all of our directly-owned properties were classified as held for sale, therefore,   no   depreciation and amortization were recorded on these assets for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
       
           (c) 
    Represents the prepayment penalty incurred at our real estate investments due to the termination of our secured mortgage loans. Although this loss is included in the calculation of net income (loss), we have excluded it from MFFO because we believe doing so more appropriately presents the operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis. 
       
           (8) 
    Represents acquisition expenses and acquisition fees paid to our Advisor that are expensed in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. We fund such costs with sales proceeds and acquisition-related indebtedness, and therefore do not consider these expenses in evaluating our operating performance and determining MFFO.  

Related-Party Transactions and Agreements 
    
  We have entered into agreements with the Advisor and Hines or its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees and reimbursements to these entities, including property management fees, leasing fees, construction management fees, debt financing fees, re-development construction management fees, reimbursement of organizational and offering expenses, and reimbursement of certain operating costs, as described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and previously in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Subsequent Events 
    
  Champions Village 
    
  In October 2016, we sold Champions Village for a sales price of   $50.0 million   to the same buyer that purchased   seven   of the Grocery-Anchored Portfolio properties in August 2016. The Grocery-Anchored Portfolio consisted of   eight   grocery-anchored shopping centers that were acquired in January 2014 for   $178.2 million   in aggregate. See Note 3   Real Estate Investments   Property Sales for information regarding the sale of   seven   of the Grocery-Anchored Portfolio properties. 
    
  West Coast Assets 
    
  As described in Note 1   Organization, in November 2016, we sold the West Coast Assets for an aggregate sales price of   $1.162 billion  . We originally acquired the West Coast Assets between June 2005 and May 2015 for a purchase price of   $1.1 billion   in aggregate.  
    
  Civica Office Commons 
    
  In November 2016, we sold Civica Office Commons for a sales price of $  193.0 million  . We originally acquired Civica Office Commons in February 2015 for a purchase price of $  205.5 million  . 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
    
  Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Interest rate risk is the primary risk in pursuing our business plan.  As of September 30, 2016, we had no outstanding debt secured by our directly-held properties and no exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on equity prices. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures. 
    
  In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  , to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  No change occurred in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings. 
    
  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business and from time to time, the Company is also subject to other types of litigation.  Please see the description below for information concerning a purported derivative and class action lawsuit. As of   September 30, 2016  , neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries was a party to any pending legal proceeding which the Company believed was material. 
    
  On August 11, 2016, a purported derivative and class action lawsuit, Gamburg v. Hines Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., et al., No. 24-C-16-004496, was filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, against the Company, our Advisor and its owners, certain affiliated entities and current and former members of the Board, alleging, among other things, that they breached their fiduciary, contractual and other duties, caused the waste of corporate assets, and misappropriated corporate assets in connection with certain payments related to the participation interest that are expected to be made to certain affiliated entities in connection with the Plan of Liquidation and in connection with other payments that have previously been made to entities affiliated with our Advisor. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 20, 2016.  The amended complaint seeks monetary damages from the entities affiliated with our Advisor and individual defendants as well as a variety of equitable and injunctive relief against all parties, including enjoining any distributions pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, enjoining the dissolution of the Company and seeking attorneys  fees and expenses, and unspecified actual and punitive damages. We intend to seek dismissal of the derivative claims. The Company and the other defendants believe the purported direct claims, as well as the derivative claims, against them are wholly without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them.  

Item 1A.    Risk Factors. 
    
   We are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in our   2015   Annual Report. There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we did not sell or issue any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  
    
  On May 31, 2016, our board of directors voted to suspend indefinitely our share redemption program, effective as of June 30, 2016.  Accordingly, there were no share redemptions during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .
