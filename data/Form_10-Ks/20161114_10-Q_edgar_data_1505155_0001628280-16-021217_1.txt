  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
   
  1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
  Basis of Presentation  
  These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for interim financial reporting.  In the opinion of management of the Company, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation.  The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016   or for any other period.  
  The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. 
  Use of Estimates  
  The preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation, contingent consideration, acquired intangible assets, the useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, and income taxes. In accordance with GAAP, management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers  
  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company s cash and cash equivalents are placed with high-quality financial institutions, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in these accounts, and the Company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents. The Company provides credit, in the normal course of business, to a number of its customers. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral.   No   individual customer represented more than 10% of total revenues in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015   or for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , or more than 10% of accounts receivable as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, and long term debt. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value, primarily due to short maturities. The carrying values of the Company s debt instruments approximated their fair value based on rates currently available to the Company.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step process to achieve that core principle. ASU 2014-09 requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued FASB ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, using one of two retrospective application methods. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2015-14 will have on its financial statements as well as timing of adoption and method of adoption. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued FASB ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The new standard provides guidance around management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.  The Company does not intend to adopt this standard prior to the effective date. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  ASU 2015-17 eliminates the requirement for an entity to separate deferred income taxes and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position.  T  o simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.    The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.   As all deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 were noncurrent, the early adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2016, using retrospective application, does not result in any reclassification as of December 31, 2015. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).  The core change with ASU 2016-02 is the requirement for th  e recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP.    The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.   The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718).  The core change with ASU 2016-09 is the simplification of several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classifications of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows  .    The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.   The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on its financial statements. 
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.    The amendments in ASU 2016-10 do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in ASU 2016-10 clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related  
  
   6 

principles for those areas.    The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-10 will have on its financial statements. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.    The amendments in ASU 2012-12 do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments clarify the following aspects of Topic 606: assessing the collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, contract modifications at transition, completed contracts at modification, and retrospective application, while retaining the related principles for those areas.    The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-12 will have on its financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Updates ( ASU ) No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which changes the impairment model for most financial assets. The new model uses a forward-looking expected loss method, which will generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on its financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15). ASU 2016-15 is intended to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows and to eliminate the diversity in practice related to such classifications. The guidance in ASU 2016-15 is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on its financial statements. 
   
  2. Acquisitions    
  2016 Acquisitions 
  On January 7, 2016, Upland completed its purchase of substantially all of the assets of our California-based website analytics provider. The purchase price consideration paid was approximately   $8.1 million   in cash payable at closing (net of   $0.3 million   of cash acquired) and a   $1.2 million   cash holdback payable in 12 months (subject to indemnification claims). The foregoing excludes additional potential earnout payments tied to performance-based conditions.   Revenues recorded since the acquisition date through   September 30, 2016   were approximately   $2,365,000  . 
    
  In addition to the cash consideration described above, the Asset Purchase Agreement included a contingent share consideration component pursuant to which Upland issued an aggregate of    $2.4 million   in common stock on July 25, 2016. The Company agreed to additional consideration of up to   $5 million   in cash to the selling shareholders of our website analytics business based on the achievement of certain revenue targets during fiscal years 2016 and 2017.  
    
  On March 14, 2016, Upland completed its purchase of substantially all of the assets of Hipcricket, Inc., a cloud-based mobile messaging software provider. The consideration paid to the seller consisted of our issuance of   one million   shares of our common stock and the transfer of our EPM Live product business. The value of the shares on the closing date of the transaction was approximately   $5.7 million   and the fair value of our EPM Live product business was approximately   $5.9 million  . The Company recognized a loss on the transfer in conjunction with the EPM Live net asset value of approximately   $0.7 million   in Other expense, net.  Prior to the transaction, Hipcricket was owned by an affiliate of ESW Capital, LLC, which is a shareholder of Upland. Raymond James   Co. provided a fairness opinion to Upland in connection with the transaction.   Revenues recorded since the acquisition date through   September 30, 2016   were approximately   $2,447,000  . 
    
  On April 27, 2016, Upland acquired Advanced Processing   Imaging, Inc., a content management platform driving workflow in governments and schools. The purchase price consideration consisted of   $4.0 million   in cash payable at  
  
   7 

closing (net of   $0.2 million   of cash acquired), and a   $0.8 million   cash holdback payable in 12 months (subject to indemnification claims).    Revenues recorded since the acquisition date through   September 30, 2016   were approximately   $1,088,000  . 
  The Company recorded the purchase of the acquisitions described above using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The purchase price allocations for the 2015 acquisition of Ultriva and the 2016 acquisitions of our   website analytics business,    Hipcricket and API are preliminary as the Company has not obtained and evaluated all of the detailed information necessary to finalize the opening balance sheet amounts in all respects.  Management has recorded the purchase price allocations based upon acquired company information that is currently available.  Management expects to finalize its purchase price allocations in the latter half of 2016. 
  The following condensed table presents the preliminary acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisitions, as well as assets and liabilities (in thousands): 

Tangible assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts, which approximates their estimated fair value. The valuation of identifiable intangible assets reflects management s estimates based on, among other factors, use of established valuation methods. Customer relationships were valued using an income approach, which estimates fair value based on the earnings and cash flow capacity of the subject asset. The value of the marketing-related intangibles was determined using a relief-from-royalty method, which estimates fair value based on the value the owner of the asset receives from not having to pay a royalty to use the asset. Developed technology was valued using a cost-to-recreate approach.  
  Goodwill deductible for tax purposes is   $4.9 million   for our website analytics business acquisition and   $8.2 million   for HipCricket. There was   no   Goodwill deductible for tax purposes for our API acquisition.

3. Fair Value Measurements    
  Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. GAAP sets forth a three tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The three tiers are Level 1, defined as observable inputs, such as quoted market prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore, requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.  
  Changes to the fair value of earnout liabilities are recorded to other expense, net.  Lia  bilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):   

The earnout consideration liability consists of amounts associated with the acquisitions of Mobile Commons and our website analytics business acquisition.  The fair value of the earnout consideration associated with the Mobile Commons acquisition was determined using the Binary Option model based on the present value of the probability-weighted earnout consideration.  This   $0.5 million   Level 3 earnout consideration liability was removed through settlement during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  The   $3.1 million   addition to fair value of the earnout consideration associated with   our website analytics business acquisition   was determined using the Monte Carlo Simulation method based on the present value of the probability-weighted earnout consideration.  The Monte Carlo Simulation method includes assumptions as to probability of various outcomes and, accordingly, the actual contingent consideration incurred could vary from the current estimate. However, the total contingent consideration incurred would not exceed the maximum potential payout of   $5.0 million   in cash and   $2.4 million   in common stock (which was fully issued during July, 2016).  In conjunction with the contingent stock consideration, the increase in fair value issued over carrying value of   $80 thousand   was recorded in Other Expense (see Note   2  ).   
  The following table presents additional information about liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and for which we have utilized significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs to determine fair value: 

Debt 
  The Company believes the carrying value of its long-term debt at   September 30, 2016   approximates its fair value based on the variable interest rate feature or based upon interest rates currently available to the Company. 
  
   9 

The estimated fair value of our debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is   $38.3 million   and   $24.9 million  , respectively, based on valuation methodologies using interest rates currently available to the Company which are Level 2 inputs.  
  
   10 

4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets    
  Changes in the Company s goodwill balance for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are summarized in the table below (in thousands): 

Intangible assets, net, include the estimated acquisition-date fair values of customer relationships, marketing-related assets, and developed technology that the Company recorded as part of its business acquisitions.  
  The following is a summary of the Company s intangible assets, net (in thousands): 

The following table summarizes the Company's weighted-average amortization period, in total and by major finite-lived intangible asset class (in years), as of: 

The Company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in either a diminished fair value or revised useful life. There have been   no   indicators of impairment or change in the useful life during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Total amortization expense was   $5.6 million   and   $4.5 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  
   11 

Estimated annual amortization expense for the next five years and thereafter is as follows (in thousands): 

5. Income Taxes    
  The Company s income tax provision for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   reflects its estimate of the effective tax rates expected to be applicable for the full years, adjusted for any discrete events that are recorded in the period in which they occur. The estimates are reevaluated each quarter based on the estimated tax expense for the full year. The tax provision for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is primarily related to foreign income taxes associated with our Canadian operations, changes in deferred tax liabilities associated with amortization of United States tax deductible goodwill and state taxes in certain states in which the Company does not file on a consolidated basis. The Company has historically incurred operating losses in the United States and, given its cumulative losses and limited history of profits, has recorded a valuation allowance against its United States net deferred tax assets, exclusive of tax deductible goodwill, at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The Company has reflected any uncertain tax positions within its current taxes payable, but none in deferred taxes. Federal, state, and foreign income tax returns have been filed in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. Varying among the separate companies, tax years 1998 through   2015   remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities due to our net operating loss carryforwards. In the foreign jurisdictions, tax years 2008 through   2015   remain subject to examination. 
   
  6. Net Loss Per Share    
  The following table sets forth the computations of loss per share (in thousands, except share and per share amounts): 

12 

Due to the net losses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , basic and diluted loss per share were the same, as the effect of all potentially dilutive securities would have been anti dilutive. The following table sets forth the anti dilutive common share equivalents (which does not include   318,302   common shares issued July 25, 2016 in conjunction with the acquisition of our website analytics business, as a result of the achievement of certain revenue targets): 

7. Commitments and Contingencies     
  Purchase Commitments 
  The Company has an outstanding purchase commitment for software development services pursuant to a technology services agreement in the amount of   $2.3 million   in   2016  , of which   $1.7 million     was incurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . For years after   2016  , the purchase commitment amount for software development services will be equal to the prior year purchase commitment increased (decreased) by the percentage change in total revenue for the prior year as compared to the preceding year. For example, if   2016   total revenues increase by   10%   as compared to   2015   total revenues, then the   2017   purchase commitment would increase by approximately   $0.2 million   from the   2016   purchase commitment amount to   $2.6 million  . A similar   10%   increase in   2017   total revenues as compared to   2016   total revenues would increase the 2018 purchase commitment amount from the theoretical   2017   purchase commitment amount of   $2.6 million   by approximately   $0.3 million   to   $2.9 million  .

  In the normal course of business, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings. While the ultimate results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect them to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.

10. Related Party Transactions    
  The Company purchased software development services pursuant to a technology services agreement with a company controlled by a non-management investor in the Company during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   in the amount of   $587,000   and   $550,000     and during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   in the amount of   $1,732,000   and   $1,425,000  , respectively. Refer to Note   7   for a description of purchase commitments to this company.  
  When the Company receives requested services as detailed by statements of work pursuant to the software development agreement, it determines whether such software development costs should be capitalized as either internally-used software or software to be sold or otherwise marketed. If such costs are not capitalizable, the Company expenses such costs as the services are received. If the Company anticipates that it will not utilize the full amount of the annual minimum fee, the estimated unused portion of the annual minimum fee is expensed at that time. 
  The Company also purchased approximately   $553,000   and   $1,147,000   in services from a company controlled by a non-management investor in the Company during the   three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  There are no purchase commitments with this company, and the Company continues to use their services in 2016. 
  The Company has an arrangement with a former subsidiary to provide management, human resource/payroll and administrative services, the fees for which during 2015 totaled   $360,000   and are expected to be similar in 2016, and these fees during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   totaled   $90,000   and   $270,000  , respectively, in both periods. 
  On March 14, 2016, Upland completed its purchase of substantially all of the assets of Hipcricket, Inc., a 
  cloud-based mobile messaging software provider, and completed the transfer of its EPM Live product business. Prior to the transaction, Hipcricket was owned by an affiliate of ESW Capital, LLC, which is a shareholder of Upland. Raymond James   Co. provided a fairness opinion to Upland in connection with the transaction.  Refer to Note 3 for a description of the transaction.  Relating to this transaction, the Company is providing certain transition services to and receiving certain transition services from the affiliate.  The cost offsets earned by the Company for these services during the   three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $0   and   $706,000   and the fees owed to the affiliate by the Company for these services during the   three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $0   and   $144,000  , respectively.

  Overview  
  Upland is a leading provider of cloud-based enterprise work management software. We define enterprise work management software as software applications that enable organizations to plan, manage and execute projects and work. Our family of applications enables users to manage their projects, professional workforce and IT investments, automate document-intensive business processes and effectively engage with their customers, prospects and community via the web and mobile technologies. 
  Our applications are easy-to-use, highly scalable and offer real-time collaboration for knowledge workers distributed on a local or global scale. Our applications address enterprise work challenges in the following categories: 
             
    Project and Information Technology (IT) Financial Management  . Enables customers to manage their organization s projects, professional workforce and IT costs.  
                
    Workflow Automation  . Enables customers to automate document-intensive workflows among internal functional areas as well as with their partners and supply chain.  
                
    Digital Engagement  . Enables customers to effectively engage with their customers, prospects and community via the web and mobile technologies.   
     We sell our software applications primarily through a direct sales organization comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel. In addition to our direct sales organization, we have an indirect sales organization, which sells to distributors and value-added resellers. We employ a land-and-expand go-to-market strategy. After we demonstrate the value of an initial application to an organization, our sales and account management teams work to expand the adoption of that application across the organization. Our customer success organization supports our direct sales efforts by managing the post-sale customer lifecycle. We refer to our customer relationships representing greater than $25,000 in annualized recurring revenue as major customers and expansions with respect to a single customer of greater than $25,000 in annualized recurring revenue as major expansions.  
  Our subscription agreements are typically sold either on a per-seat basis or on a minimum contracted volume basis with overage fees, depending on the application being sold. We service customers ranging from large global corporations and government agencies to small- and medium-sized businesses. We have more than   2,000   customers with over   235,000   users across a broad range of industries, including financial services, retail, technology, manufacturing, education, consumer goods, media, telecommunications, government, food and beverage, healthcare and life sciences. 
  We have achieved significant growth and scale in a relatively short period of time. Through a series of acquisitions, we have established a diverse family of software applications under the Upland brand, each of which addresses a specific enterprise work management need. Our revenue has grown from $22.8 million in fiscal 2012 to $69.9 million in fiscal 2015, representing a 207% period-over-period growth rate. See Note   9   in the Notes to

Consolidated Financial Statements in this 10-Q for more information regarding our revenue as it relates to domestic and foreign operations.  
  Our operating results in a given period can fluctuate based on the mix of subscription and support, perpetual license and professional services revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our subscription and support revenue accounted for 82%, 75% and 75% of our total revenue, respectively, and   88%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Our customer agreements for program and portfolio management, project management and collaboration, and professional services automation typically are sold on a per-seat basis with terms varying from one to three years, paid in advance. Our customer agreements for workflow automation and enterprise content management and financial management historically have been typically sold on a volume basis with a one-year term, paid in advance. We generally seek to enter into multi-year contracts with our customers when possible. In each case, our customer agreements provide us with revenue visibility over a number of quarters. We typically negotiate the total number of seats or total minimum contracted volume a customer is entitled to use as part of its subscription, but these seats or minimum contracted volume may not be fully utilized over the term of the agreement. In addition, typically when customers exceed the minimum contracted volume, additional overage fees are charged.  
  Historically, we have sold certain of our applications under perpetual licenses, which also are paid in advance. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our perpetual license revenue accounted for 4%, 4%, and 5% of our total revenue, respectively and   2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . We expect perpetual license revenue to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the future. The support agreements related to our perpetual licenses are typically one-year or greater in duration and entitle the customer to support and unspecified upgrades. The revenue related to such support agreements is included as part of our subscription and support revenue.  
  Professional services revenue consists of fees related to implementation, data extraction, integration and configuration and training on our applications. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our professional services revenue accounted for 14%, 21%, and 20% of our total revenue, respectively and   10%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . We expect the proportional revenue contribution of product and professional services revenue to shift more to product revenue and less to professional services revenue in future periods. 
  We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements. We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, and renew agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each calendar year as our customers tend to follow budgeting cycles at the end of the calendar year. Our cash flow from operations has historically been higher in the first quarter of each calendar year than in other quarters. This seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent, in our revenue due to the fact that we defer revenue recognition. In addition, seasonality may be difficult to observe in our financial results during periods in which we acquire businesses. We expect this seasonality to continue, or possibly increase in the future, which may cause fluctuations in our operating results and financial metrics. 
  To support continued growth, we intend to pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, products and businesses to enhance the features and functionalities of our applications, expand our customer base, and provide access to new markets and increased benefits of scale. We will prioritize acquisitions within the enterprise functions we currently serve, including information technology, process excellence, finance, professional services and marketing, as well as pursue acquisitions that serve other enterprise functions. Consistent with our growth strategy, we have made   twelve   acquisitions since our initial acquisition in   2012   through the period ending   September 30, 2016  .

Key Metrics  
  In addition to the GAAP financial measures described below in   Components of Operating Results,  we regularly review the following key metrics to evaluate and identify trends in our business, measure our performance, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. 
  Adjusted EBITDA 
  Adjusted EBITDA.   We monitor our Adjusted EBITDA to help us evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.   We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus net income (loss) from discontinued operations, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, net, other expense (income), net, provision for income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, non-recurring litigation costs, and   purchase accounting adjustments for deferred revenue  .  
  The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss from continuing operations, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated. 

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management, investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:  
             
    Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired; 
                
    our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, in the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our operating performance, to assess the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance because Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance; and 
                
    Adjusted EBITDA provides more consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our operations and also facilitates comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.  
     Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations, including:   
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; however, much of the depreciation and amortization currently reflected relates to amortization of acquired intangible assets as a result of business combination purchase accounting adjustments, which will not need to be replaced in the future;   
                
    Adjusted EBITDA may not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments;   
                
    Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation;   
                
    Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest or tax payments that could reduce cash available for use; and, 
                
    other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.    
     Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA together with other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.

Comparison of the   Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  Revenue 

For the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016    
  Total revenue was   $19.2 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $17.1 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,   an increase of     $2.1 million  , or   12%  . The 2015 and 2016 acquisitions contributed an increase of  $3.5 million after the reduction of   $0.3 million   purchase accounting deferred revenue discount.  Total revenue declined by $1.5 million due to the divestiture of the EPM Live product line in Q1 2016. Therefore, total revenue for the organic business increased by $0.1 million or 1%. 
    
  Subscription and support revenue was   $17.0 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $14.1 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,   an increase of     $2.9 million  , or   21%  . The 2015 and 2016 acquisitions contributed to an   increase   in subscription and support revenue of $3.2 million after the reduction of   $0.3 million   purchase accounting deferred revenue discount. Subscription and support revenue decreased by $0.7 million due to the divestiture of the EPM Live product line in Q1 2016 with an immaterial impact from foreign currency exchange rate between the Canada dollar versus the U.S. dollar during the most recent period. Therefore, subscription and support revenue for the organic business increased by $0.4 million or   3%  . 
    
  Perpetual license revenue was   $0.3 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $0.5 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease of     $0.2 million  , or   39%  . Perpetual license revenue declined by $0.1 million due to the divestiture of the EPM Live product line and the remaining $0.1 million decline was organic as we continue to focus sales efforts on recurring revenue customer contracts over one-time perpetual license sales. 
  Professional services revenue was   $1.9 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $2.4 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease of     $0.5 million  , or   23%  .  The acquisitions we closed in 2015 and 2016 contributed to a $0.3 million increase to professional services revenue.  The divestiture of the EPM product line   in Q1 2016   contributed to a $0.6 million decrease in professional services revenue.    Therefore, professional services revenue for the organic business decreased by $0.2 million, or 11% from the prior year.

For the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016    
  Total revenue was   $55.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $52.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   an increase of     $3.1 million  , or   6%  . The 2015 and 2016 acquisitions contributed an   increase   in total revenue of $8.5 million after the reduction of   $1.2 million   purchase accounting deferred revenue discount. Total revenue declined by $4.6 million due to the divestiture of the EPM Live product line at the end of February 2016, and by $0.7 million from a lower foreign currency exchange rate between the Canada dollar versus the U.S. dollar during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Therefore, on a constant currency basis, total revenue for the organic business declined by $0.1 million or 0%. 
    
  Subscription and support revenue was   $48.5 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $42.5 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   an increase of     $6.0 million  , or   14%  . Of the   increase   in subscription and support revenue, the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions contributed to an   increase   of $7.7 million after the reduction of   $1.2 million   purchase accounting deferred revenue discount. Subscription and support revenue decreased by $2.0  million due to the divestiture of the EPM Live product line at the end of February 2016, and decreased by $0.6 million from a lower foreign currency exchange rate between the Canada dollar versus the U.S. dollar during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Therefore, on a constant currency basis, subscription and support revenue for the organic business grew by $0.9 million or 2%. 
    
  Perpetual license revenue was   $1.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $2.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease of     $1.1 million  , or   50%  . Perpetual license revenue declined by $0.5 million due to the divestiture of the EPM Live product line at the end of February 2016 and the remaining $0.6 million decline was organic as we continue to focus sales efforts on recurring revenue customer contracts over one-time perpetual license sales. 
  Professional services revenue was   $5.8 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $7.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease of     $1.8 million  , or   24%  .  The acquisitions we closed in 2015 and 2016 contributed to a $0.7 million increase to professional services revenue.  The divestiture of the EPM product   line at the end of February 2016   contributed to a $2.0 million decrease in professional services revenue. A decrease   of $0.1 million was attributable to a lower foreign currency exchange rate between the Canada dollar versus the U.S. dollar during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .    Therefore, professional services revenue for the organic business decreased by $0.4 million or 7%.

The 2015 and 2016 acquisitions contributed an increase in cost of professional services revenue of $0.4 million primarily due to personnel and related costs.  Cost of professional services revenue decreased $1.2 million due to the divestiture of the EPM Live product line in Q1 2016 consisting primarily of personnel and related costs.  The cost of the organic portion of our professional services business declined by $0.7 million and consisted primarily of personnel and related costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  To date, we have financed our operations primarily through issuance of common stock and cash from operating activities, and to a lesser extent, borrowing under our loan and security agreements and the issuance of seller notes. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $17.5 million  ,   $5.0 million   of available borrowings under our loan and security agreements, and   $38.3 million   of borrowings outstanding under our loan and security agreements compared to cash and cash equivalents of   $18.5 million  ,   $20.0 million   of available borrowings under our loan and security agreements, and   $24.4 million   of borrowings outstanding under our loan and security agreements as of   December 31, 2015  .  In addition to the available borrowings noted above, our current credit facility provides for an additional $10.0 million in subordinated seller notes for acquisitions plus an uncommitted $15.0 million accordion loan for future acquisitions.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had a working capital deficit of   $5.2 million   and surplus of   $1.0 million  , respectively, which included   $23.1 million   and   $19.9 million   of deferred revenue recorded as a current liability as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. This deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy.  
  The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  Cash used in operating activities is significantly influenced by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business. Our operating assets and liabilities consist primarily of cash, receivables from customers and unbilled professional services, accounts payable and accrued expenses and deferred revenues. The volume of professional services rendered and the related timing of collections on those bookings, as well as payments of our accounts payable and accrued payroll and related benefits affect these account balances. 
  Our cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily reflects our net loss of   $11.5 million   plus non-cash expenses that included   $7.5 million   of depreciation and amortization,   $2.7 million   of non-cash stock compensation expense,   $0.3 million   of deferred income taxes,   $0.2 million   of non-cash interest and other, and   $0.7 million   loss on disposal of business offset by   $0.2 million   of foreign currency re-measurement   gains  . Working capital sources of cash included a   $0.3 million     decrease   in accounts receivable, a   $0.8 million     decrease   in prepaids and other and a   $1.4 million     increase   in deferred revenue. These sources of cash were offset by a   $0.1 million     decrease   in accounts payable and a   $0.8 million     decrease   in accrued expenses and other liabilities.  
  A substantial source of cash is provided as a result of invoicing for subscriptions in advance, which is recorded as deferred revenue, and is included on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability. Deferred revenue consists of the unearned portion of booked fees for our software subscriptions and support, which is amortized into revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. We assess our liquidity, in part, through an analysis of  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

new subscriptions invoiced, expected cash receipts on new and existing subscriptions, and our ongoing operating expense requirements. 
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  Our primary investing activities have consisted of acquisitions of complementary technologies, products and businesses. As our business grows, we expect our primary investing activities to continue to further expand our family of software applications and infrastructure and support additional personnel.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   cash used in investing activities for business combinations, consisted of cash proceeds paid during the period to certain sellers of our website analytics and workflow automation business acquisitions, which were acquired in January and April, 2016, respectively totaling   $11.8 million  , purchases of customer relationships of   $0.4 million   and purchases of property and equipment of   $0.9 million  . 
  Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced applications and professional service offerings and acquisitions of complementary technologies, products and businesses.  
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  Our primary financing activities have consisted of capital raised to fund our operations, proceeds from debt obligations entered into to finance our operations, repayments of our debt obligations and share based payment activity.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we received   $0.2 million   related to the issuance of our common stock, borrowed   $5.0 million   under the revolver portion of our credit agreement in addition to borrowing   $10.0 million   under the delayed draw term loan of our credit agreement in conjunction with the acquisition of our website analytics and Advanced Processing   Imaging, Inc. acquisitions, repaid   $1.6 million   of term notes payable, paid   $1.5 million   in additional consideration to sellers of acquired businesses and made principal payments of   $1.3 million   on capital leases. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special-purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and the Use of Estimates  
  We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates. 
  The following critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: 
    revenue recognition and deferred revenue; 
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

stock-based compensation; 
    income taxes; and 
    business combinations and the recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets. 
    
  Our unaudited interim financial statements and other financial information for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as presented herein and in Item 1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, reflects no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates as set forth in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. Please refer to this Annual Report for a detailed description of our critical accounting policies that involve significant management judgment.  
    
  We evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis, and while we believe that our estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
  We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate, foreign exchange and inflation risks, as well as risks relating to changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. The statement of operations impact is mitigated by having an offsetting liability in deferred revenue to partially or 
  completely offset against the outstanding receivable if an account should become uncollectible. Our cash balances are kept in customary operating accounts, a portion of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and uninsured money market accounts. The majority of our cash balances in money market accounts are with Comerica Bank, our former lender under our loan and security agreements. To date, we have not used derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of our market risk exposures. We also have not used, nor do we intend to use, derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our cash equivalents and any variable rate indebtedness. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. This objective is accomplished currently by making diversified investments, consisting only of money market mutual funds and certificates of deposit. Any draws under our loan and security agreements bear interest at a variable rate tied to the prime rate. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a principal balance of   $27.7 million   under our U.S. Term Loan,   $5.0 million   under our U.S. Revolver,   $5.6 million   under our Canadian Term Loan and   none   under our Canadian Revolver.  As of   December 31, 2015  , we had a principal balance of   $18.5 million   under our U.S. Loan Agreement and   $5.9 million   under our Canadian Loan Agreement.  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents  

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
  Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, we incur a portion of our operating expenses in foreign currencies, including Canadian dollars, British pounds and Euro, and in the future as we expand into other foreign countries, we expect to incur operating expenses in other foreign currencies. In addition, our customers are generally invoiced in the currency of the country in which they are located. We are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our international operations are translated from the local functional currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. A decline in the U.S. dollar relative to foreign functional currencies would increase our non-U.S. revenue and improve our operating results. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to foreign functional currencies, our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would have resulted in a change in revenue of   $1.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
    
  Inflation 
  We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of 
  operations in the last three fiscal years. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we 
  may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm 
  our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  
   
  Risks Related to Our Business  
  Other than with respect to the replacement of the risk factor entitled our loan agreements contain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the   year ended December 31, 2015  , with the risk factor set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the   year ended December 31, 2015  .

     Table of Contents  

On May 14, 2015, we entered into a $60 million credit facility with Wells Fargo Capital Finance. The facility is comprised of a $25 million term loan, a $10 million revolving credit facility and a $10 million delayed draw term loan for acquisitions. Additionally, the facility provides for an uncommitted $15 million accordion loan to further support future acquisitions and an additional $10 million of subordinated seller notes for acquisitions. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $38.3 million   outstanding under the credit facility,   $33.3 million   of which was outstanding under the term loan portion and   $5.0 million   outstanding under the revolving portion of the credit facility. 
  Our obligations and the obligations of the co-borrowers and any guarantors under the Wells Fargo credit facility are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets and assets of the co-borrowers  and of any guarantors, including intellectual property. The terms of the credit facility limits, among other things, our ability to 
             
    sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of assets; 
                
    undergo a change in control; 
                
    consolidate or merge with or into other entities; 
                
    make or own loans, investments and acquisitions; 
                
    create, incur or assume guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons; 
                
    create, incur or assume liens and other encumbrances; or 
                
    pay dividends or make distributions on, or purchase or redeem, our capital stock. 
       
  Furthermore, the Wells Fargo credit facility requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with certain financial covenants. The operating and other restrictions and covenants in the credit facility, and in any future financing arrangements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in certain business activities, or expand or fully pursue our business strategies, or otherwise limit our discretion to manage our business. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those restrictions and covenants. A breach of any of the restrictions and covenants could result in a default under the credit facility or any future financing arrangements, which could cause any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility or under any future financing arrangements to become immediately due and payable, and result in the termination of commitments to extend further credit.

    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
